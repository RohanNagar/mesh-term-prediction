The ``learners.generic`` module contains Learners that are not designed for a specific
type of problem or data. They mostly serve as interfaces to derive new
Learners.

This module contains the following classes:

* Learner:         Root class for all learning algorithms.
* OnlineLearner:   Interface for Learners that can be traiend "online".

class OnlineLearner(Learner):
    """
    Class (interface) for Learners that can be trained "online".

    This class interface makes it easier to construct a learner. All
    that must be defined are four following methods:

    * ``initialize_learner(self,metadata)``
    * ``update_learner(self,example)``
    * ``use_learner(self,example)``
    * ``cost(self,output,example)``

    Method ``initialize_learner()`` simply initializes
    the learner. The training set's 'metadata' is also available.

    Method ``update_learner()`` updates the learner's parameters
    using the given 'example'.

    Method ``use_learner()`` should return the output
    for the given 'example'. The output should be a sequence
    (even if it has just one element in it), to allow
    for multiple outputs. Make sure not to return an object
    that is referenced internally and is still
    being used by the class object.

    Method ``cost()`` should return the cost associated
    to some 'output' for the given 'example'. The returned
    cost should be a sequence (even if it has just one
    element in it), to allow for multiple costs.

    Option ``n_stages`` specifies how many iterations over the
    training set is done at every call of ``train()``.

    All other hyper-parameters for the learner supplied
    through the constructor will be assigned as attributes
    to the object, and hence will be accessible
    by all methods.

    Example of methods for a linear perceptron. ::

       import numpy as np
       import mlpython

       class Perceptron(mlpython.learners.OnlineLearner):

          def initialize_learner(self,metadata):
             self.w = np.zeros((metadata['input_size']))
             self.b = 0.

          def update_learner(self,example):
             input = example[0]
             target = 2*example[1]-1 # Targets are 0/1
             output = np.dot(self.w,input)+self.b
             if np.sign(output) != target:
                self.w += self.lr * target * input
                self.b += self.lr * target

          def use_learner(self,example):
             return [np.sign(np.dot(self.w,example[0])+self.b)]

          def cost(self,output,example):
             return [int(output != 2*example[1]-1)]

    When creating an instance, must provide the
    value of the hyper-parameter lr: ::

       perceptron = Perceptron(1,lr=0.01)

    Alternatively, one could override the constructor to
    specify some default hyper-parameters: ::

       class Perceptron(mlpython.learners.OnlineLearner):

          def __init__(self, n_stages,
                       lr = 0.01):
              self.n_stages = n_stages
              self.stage = 0
              self.lr = lr

    """

    def __init__(self, n_stages, **kw):

        self.n_stages = n_stages
        self.stage = 0
        for k, v in kw.items():
            setattr(self, k, v)

    def train(self, trainset):
        if self.stage == 0:
            self.initialize_learner(trainset.metadata)
        for it in range(self.stage, self.n_stages):
            for example in trainset:
                self.update_learner(example)

    def forget(self):
        self.stage = 0

    def use(self, dataset):
        outputs = []
        for example in dataset:
            outputs += [self.use_learner(example)]
        return outputs

    def test(self, dataset):
        outputs = self.use(dataset)
        costs = []
        for example, output in zip(dataset, outputs):
            costs += [self.cost(output, example)]
        return outputs, costs
