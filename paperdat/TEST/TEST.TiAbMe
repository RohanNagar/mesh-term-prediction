9317033|t|Involvement of p21racA, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and vacuolar ATPase in phagocytosis of bacteria and erythrocytes by Entamoeba histolytica: suggestive evidence for coincidental evolution of amebic invasiveness.
9317033|a|Trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan parasite that causes amebic dysentery, phagocytose bacteria in the colonic lumen and erythrocytes (RBC) in host tissues. Because tissue invasion is an evolutionary dead end, it is likely that amebic pathogenicity is coincidentally selected, i.e., the same methods used to kill bacteria in the colonic lumen are used by parasites to damage host cells and cause disease. In support of this idea, the amebic lectin and pore-forming peptide are involved in binding and killing, respectively, bacteria and host epithelial cells. Here amebic phagocytosis of bacteria, RBC, and mucin-coated beads was disrupted by overexpression of E. histolytica p21(racA-V12), a ras-family protein involved in selection of sites of actin polymerization, which had been mutated to eliminate its GTPase activity. p21(racA-V12) transformants were also defective in capping and cytokinesis, while pinocytosis of fluorescent dextrans was not affected. Wortmannin, a fungal inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria, RBC, and mucin-coated beads by wild-type amebae. In contrast to p21(racA-V12) overexpression, wortmannin abolished amebic pinocytosis of dextrans but had no inhibitory effects on capping. Inhibition of amebic vacuolar acidification by bafilomycin also decreased bacterial and RBC uptake. These results, which demonstrate similarities between mechanisms of phagocytosis of bacteria and RBC by amebae and macrophages, support the idea of coincidental selection of amebic genes encoding proteins that mediate destruction of host cells.

9378488|t|TCR alpha beta+ CD4- CD8- T cells differentiate extrathymically in an lck-independent manner and participate in early response against Listeria monocytogenes infection through interferon-gamma production.
9378488|a|T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta+ CD4- CD8- (double-negative; DN) T cells appear in the peritoneal cavity at an early stage of intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. In the present report, we analysed the developmental pathway and functions of the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells using the L. monocytogenes infection system. The TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells appeared in the peritoneal cavity after L. monocytogenes i.p. infection in adult-thymectomized lethally irradiated bone marrow chimeras and p56lck-deficient mice. The results demonstrated that the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells can develop extrathymically in a p56lck-independent manner. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells expressed genes for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the macrophage chemotactic factors MCP-1 and Eta-1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but lacked expression of genes for interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4 and IL-10. As expected from the RT-PCR analysis, the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells produced IFN-gamma in response to anti-TCR beta monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-CD3 mAb and L. monocytogenes-infected macrophages but IL-4 was undetectable after the stimulation. Furthermore, the intracellular cytokine staining analysis demonstrated that approximately half of the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells detectable at the early stage of L. monocytogenes infection were IFN-gamma-producing cells. All of the results suggest that the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells develop through a unique extrathymic p56lck-independent pathway and participate in early protection against bacterial infection through activation and accumulation of macrophages.

9343384|t|Elimination of defective alpha-factor pheromone receptors.
9343384|a|This report compares trafficking routes of a plasma membrane protein that was misfolded either during its synthesis or after it had reached the cell surface. A temperature-sensitive mutant form of the yeast alpha-factor pheromone receptor (ste2-3) was found to provide a model substrate for quality control of plasma membrane proteins. We show for the first time that a misfolded membrane protein is recognized at the cell surface and rapidly removed. When the ste2-3 mutant cells were cultured continuously at 34 degrees C, the mutant receptor protein (Ste2-3p) failed to accumulate at the plasma membrane and was degraded with a half-life of 4 min, compared with a half-life of 33 min for wild-type receptor protein (Ste2p). Degradation of both Ste2-3p and Ste2p required the vacuolar proteolytic activities controlled by the PEP4 gene. At 34 degrees C, Ste2-3p comigrated with glycosylated Ste2p on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that Ste2-3p enters the secretory pathway. Degradation of Ste2-3p did not require delivery to the plasma membrane as the sec1 mutation failed to block rapid turnover. Truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the mutant receptors did not permit accumulation at the plasma membrane; thus, the endocytic signals contained in this domain are unnecessary for intracellular retention. In the pep4 mutant, Ste2-3p accumulated as series of high-molecular-weight species, suggesting a potential role for ubiquitin in the elimination process. When ste2-3 mutant cells were cultured continuously at 22 degrees C, Ste2-3p accumulated in the plasma membrane. When the 22 degrees C culture was shifted to 34 degrees C, Ste2-3p was removed from the plasma membrane and degraded by a PEP4-dependent mechanism with a 24-min half-life; the wild-type Ste2p displayed a 72-min half-life. Thus, structural defects in Ste2-3p synthesized at 34 degrees C are recognized in transit to the plasma membrane, leading to rapid degradation, and Ste2-3p that is preassembled at the plasma membrane is also removed and degraded following a shift to 34 degrees C.

9326653|t|Panhandle PCR strategy to amplify MLL genomic breakpoints in treatment-related leukemias.
9326653|a|Panhandle PCR amplifies genomic DNA with known 5' and unknown 3' sequences from a template with an intrastrand loop schematically shaped like a pan with a handle. We used panhandle PCR to clone MLL genomic breakpoints in two pediatric treatment-related leukemias. The karyotype in a case of treatment-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed the t(4;11)(q21;q23). Panhandle PCR amplified the translocation breakpoint at position 2158 in intron 6 in the 5' MLL breakpoint cluster region (bcr). The karyotype in a case of treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia was normal, but Southern blot analysis showed a single MLL gene rearrangement. Panhandle PCR amplified the breakpoint at position 1493 in MLL intron 6. Screening of somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid DNAs by PCR and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of the leukemic cells indicated that panhandle PCR identified a fusion of MLL intron 6 with a previously uncharacterized sequence in MLL intron 1, consistent with a partial duplication. In both cases, the breakpoints in the MLL bcr were in Alu repeats, and there were Alu repeats in proximity to the breakpoints in the partner DNAs, suggesting that Alu sequences were relevant to these rearrangements. This study shows that panhandle PCR is an effective method for cloning MLL genomic breakpoints in treatment-related leukemias. Analysis of additional pediatric cases will determine whether breakpoint distribution deviates from the predilection for 3' distribution in the bcr that has been found in adult cases.

9378393|t|Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for severe Clostridium difficile colitis.
9378393|a|BACKGROUND: Many individuals have serum antibodies against Clostridium difficile toxins. Those with an impaired antitoxin response may be susceptible to recurrent, prolonged, or severe C difficile diarrhoea and colitis. AIMS: To examine whether treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin might be effective in patients with severe pseudomembranous colitis unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy. PATIENTS: Two patients with pseudomembranous colitis not responding to metronidazole and vancomycin were given normal pooled human immunoglobulin intravenously (200-300 mg/kg). METHODS: Antibodies against C difficile toxins were measured in nine immunoglobulin preparations by ELISA and by cytotoxin neutralisation assay. RESULTS: Both patients responded quickly as shown by resolution of diarrhoea, abdominal tenderness, and distension. All immunoglobulin preparations tested contained IgG against C difficile toxins A and B by ELISA and neutralised the cytotoxic activity of C difficile toxins in vitro at IgG concentrations of 0.4-1.6 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: Passive immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulin may be a useful addition to antibiotic therapy for severe, refractory C difficile colitis. IgG antitoxin is present in standard immunoglobulin preparations and C difficile toxin neutralising activity is evident at IgG concentrations which are readily achieved in the serum by intravenous immunoglobulin administration.

9376273|t|Primary systemic therapy for operable breast cancer--10-year survival data after chemotherapy and hormone therapy.
9376273|a|Between 1984 and 1990, 94 women presenting to the Edinburgh Breast Unit with operable breast cancer of 4 cm or greater in diameter (T2, T3, N0, N1, M0) were given preoperative systemic therapy. Initially, all women received hormone therapy, with CHOP (cyclophosphamide 1 g m(-2), doxorubicin 50 mg m(-2), vincristine 1.4 mg m(-2) to a maximum of 2 mg and prednisolone 40 mg per day orally for 5 days) chemotherapy being administered to those who failed to respond by 3 months. After April 1987, first-line hormone therapy was only offered to women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-moderate/-rich (> 20 fmol mg(-1) protein) tumours, and CHOP was reserved for those women whose tumours failed to respond to hormone therapy and for those with ER-negative/-poor tumours. Response data have been published previously (Anderson et al, 1991). After a median follow-up of 7.5 years, there is no difference in survival between those women given initial hormone therapy and those given chemotherapy, with neither group having yet reached its median survival. The two key factors that predicted for a poor survival were the number of involved axillary nodes after preoperative systemic therapy (P < 0.00001) and a lack of response to preoperative therapy (P < 0.05). These data suggest that many women with ER-moderate/-rich tumours will have a good prognosis after preoperative hormone therapy alone. However, it is possible to identify, by their post-systemic therapy axillary node status, a group of women who still have an appalling prognosis after preoperative chemotherapy or hormone therapy.

9335288|t|Three genes of a motility operon and their role in flagellar rotary speed variation in Rhizobium meliloti.
9335288|a|The peritrichous flagella of Rhizobium meliloti rotate only clockwise and control directional changes of swimming cells by modulating flagellar rotary speed. Using Tn5 insertions, we have identified and sequenced a motility (mot) operon containing three genes, motB, motC, and motD, that are translationally coupled. The motB gene (and an unlinked motA) has been assigned by similarity to the Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis homologs, whereas motC and motD are new and without known precedents in other bacteria. In-frame deletions introduced in motB, motC, or motD each result in paralysis. MotD function was fully restored by complementation with the wild-type motD gene. By contrast, deletions in motB or motC required the native combination of motB and motC in trans for restoring normal flagellar rotation, whereas complementation with motB or motC alone led to uncoordinated (jiggly) swimming. Similarly, a motB-motC gene fusion and a Tn5 insertion intervening between motB and motC resulted in jiggly swimming as a consequence of large fluctuations in flagellar rotary speed. We conclude that MotC biosynthesis requires coordinate expression of motB and motC and balanced amounts of the two gene products. The MotC polypeptide contains an N-terminal signal sequence for export, and Western blots have confirmed its location in the periplasm of the R. meliloti cell. A working model suggests that interactions between MotB and MotC at the periplasmic surface of the motor control the energy flux or the energy coupling that drives flagellar rotation.

9316922|t|Limited value of PCR for detection of Toxoplasma gondii in blood from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.
9316922|a|Cerebral toxoplasmosis is a common, opportunistic, and often life-threatening disease in HIV-infected patients. Diagnosis is supported mainly by clinical evidence and computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans, but brain images may share features with other brain diseases occurring in HIV-infected patients. To determine the diagnostic value of PCR for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii in blood from HIV-infected patients, we examined 89 blood samples from 59 HIV-infected patients. PCR and Southern blot hybridization were done with DNA extracted from blood samples from 20 patients with confirmed cerebral toxoplasmosis and from 10 patients with suspected but not confirmed cerebral toxoplasmosis. The samples were taken before and 7 to 10 days after the beginning of antiparasitic therapy. For 9 patients who suffered from cerebral toxoplasmosis more than 6 months prior to the study and for 20 patients without any evidence for toxoplasmosis only one blood sample per patient was examined. PCR gave positive results with 5 of the 20 blood samples from patients who suffered from cerebral toxoplasmosis. After 7 to 10 days of therapy PCR results became negative in all these five cases. No amplification was seen with DNA from blood samples from the other 54 patients as the target. The results presented here show that PCR testing of blood samples from HIV-infected patients is of limited value for the diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis. The sensitivity was only 25%, but the specificity was very high (100%), so this technique may be useful for discriminating between cerebral toxoplasmosis and other brain diseases which may be mistaken for toxoplasmosis.

9343165|t|Mutation of Tp53 contributes to the malignant phenotype of Abelson virus-transformed lymphoid cells.
9343165|a|Abelson murine leukemia virus transforms pre-B cells in vitro and induces rapid-onset pre-B-cell lymphoma in vivo. Expression of an active v-Abl protein tyrosine kinase is required for the oncogenic functions of the virus. Despite the strong growth-stimulatory signal provided by v-Abl, the virus-induced tumors are clonal or oligoclonal, and changes in the growth and oncogenic potential of in vitro transformants occur during the derivation of the cell lines. Both of these features suggest that v-Abl expression must be complemented by changes in expression of one or more cellular genes for cells to acquire a fully malignant phenotype. Such genes could include other oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Among the latter is Tp53, a gene mutated in many spontaneous cancers. To determine if mutation of the Tp53 tumor suppressor gene plays a role in Abelson virus transformation, conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to examine p53 expression in a panel of Abelson virus-transformed pre-B cells. Expression of mutant forms of p53 was detected in over 40% of the isolates. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of point mutations affecting the highly conserved central portion of the protein. These mutations interfered with the ability of p53 to activate transcription from a promoter containing p53-responsive elements and to induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In addition, cells expressing mutant forms of p53 induced a higher frequency of tumors with a more rapid course compared to transformants expressing wild-type p53. These data suggest that Tp53 is one important cellular gene involved in malignant transformation by Abelson virus.

8407686|t|Improving dietary practices of elderly individuals: the power of prompting feedback, and social reinforcement.
8407686|a|Three intervention packages consisting of (a) enhanced prompts, feedback, and social reinforcement; (b) a lottery; and (c) serving as a confederate were added and removed in sequence as adjacent conditions in an extended withdrawal design to assess their effects on the dietary choices of elderly persons. Participants were 3 elderly residents of an independent living facility who were identified as making consistently poor dietary choices and who had medical conditions that necessitated changes in their eating habits. All 3 participants demonstrated a marked increase in healthy choices of food items in response to the package of enhanced prompts, feedback, and social reinforcement. No additional increase occurred with the introduction of the lottery and serving as a confederate. Food-choice data indicated that most of these improvements could be attributed to healthier entree and dessert choices. Group data for all residents suggested small improvements in dietary practices during the three intervention conditions, with the largest proportion of the group's healthy choices occurring when the lottery was added to enhanced prompts, feedback, and social reinforcement. Food-choice data indicated that most of these improvements could be attributed to healthier dessert choices alone.

9114015|t|Transcriptional coactivator cAMP response element binding protein mediates induction of the human proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter by the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein.
9114015|a|The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a crucial component of eukaryotic cell cycle and DNA replication complexes, is induced by the adenovirus E1A 243R oncoprotein through a cis-acting element termed the PERE (PCNA-E1A responsive element). The PERE contains a sequence homologous to an activating transcription factor (ATF) motif, and ATF-1 is a major component of PERE-protein complexes. We have identified a second PERE-binding protein, the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor, which forms heterodimers with ATF-1 at this site. CREB, but not ATF-1, is able to mediate transactivation of a minimal PCNA-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter by E1A 243R. Further analysis revealed that the transcriptional coactivator, the CREB-binding protein (CBP), associates with PERE-related complexes, and that CBP is able to mediate a strong transactivation response to E1A 243R at the PCNA promoter. Experiments conducted with mutants in the E1A or CREB components support a model whereby E1A 243R transactivates the PCNA promoter via a CBP-CREB-PERE pathway. These findings delineate a paradigm by which E1A 243R can target and transactivate specific DNA promoter sequences.

16251317|t|Maraviroc (UK-427,857), a potent, orally bioavailable, and selective small-molecule inhibitor of chemokine receptor CCR5 with broad-spectrum anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 activity.
16251317|a|Maraviroc (UK-427,857) is a selective CCR5 antagonist with potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity and favorable pharmacological properties. Maraviroc is the product of a medicinal chemistry effort initiated following identification of an imidazopyridine CCR5 ligand from a high-throughput screen of the Pfizer compound file. Maraviroc demonstrated potent antiviral activity against all CCR5-tropic HIV-1 viruses tested, including 43 primary isolates from various clades and diverse geographic origin (geometric mean 90% inhibitory concentration of 2.0 nM). Maraviroc was active against 200 clinically derived HIV-1 envelope-recombinant pseudoviruses, 100 of which were derived from viruses resistant to existing drug classes. There was little difference in the sensitivity of the 200 viruses to maraviroc, as illustrated by the biological cutoff in this assay (= geometric mean plus two standard deviations [SD] of 1.7-fold). The mechanism of action of maraviroc was established using cell-based assays, where it blocked binding of viral envelope, gp120, to CCR5 to prevent the membrane fusion events necessary for viral entry. Maraviroc did not affect CCR5 cell surface levels or associated intracellular signaling, confirming it as a functional antagonist of CCR5. Maraviroc has no detectable in vitro cytotoxicity and is highly selective for CCR5, as confirmed against a wide range of receptors and enzymes, including the hERG ion channel (50% inhibitory concentration, >10 microM), indicating potential for an excellent clinical safety profile. Studies in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models predicted maraviroc to have human pharmacokinetics consistent with once- or twice-daily dosing following oral administration. Clinical trials are ongoing to further investigate the potential of using maraviroc for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and AIDS.

7275938|t|Mechanism of thiamine-induced respiratory deficiency in Saccharomyces carlsbergensis.
7275938|a|Cells of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 grown aerobically with added thiamine (1 microgram . ml-1) in a vitamin B6-free medium contained no detectable heme precursors, such as delta-aminolevulinate, coproporphyrin III, or protoporphyrin IX. The deficiency in heme precursors in the thiamine-grown cells was accompanied by previously reported phenomena, i.e., growth depression, vitamin B6 deficiency, and respiratory deficiency due to a marked decrease in the activities of heme-containing enzymes and cytochrome level (I. Nakamura et al., FEBS Lett. 62: 354-358, 1976). It has been reported that all of the effects of thiamine are abolished by adding pyridoxine to the medium. delta-Aminolevulinate was found to have quite similar effects to those of pyridoxine, except that growth was partially improved by delta-aminolevulinate, whereas it was fully restored by pyridoxine. Incubation of the thiamine-grown cells with delta-aminolevulinate resulted in the appearance of the heme precursors and the heme-containing enzymes. Consistent with the lowered amount of vitamin B6, the thiamine-grown cells had a lowered activity of delta-aminolevulinate synthase, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme. Not only the holoenzyme activity but also the apoenzyme activity was very low in these cells. These results indicate that the thiamine-induced vitamin B6 deficiency brings about the decrease in delta-aminolevulinate synthase activity, which leads to heme deficiency and therefore to respiratory deficiency.

8458324|t|Stably maintained microdomain of localized unrestrained supercoiling at a Drosophila heat shock gene locus.
8458324|a|A psoralen crosslinking assay was utilized to detect localized, unrestrained DNA supercoiling (torsional tension) in vivo in Drosophila chromosomal regions subject to differential transcriptional activity. By comparing rates of crosslinking in intact cells with those in cells where potential tension in chromosomal domains was relaxed by DNA strand nicking, the contribution to psoralen accessibility caused by altered DNA-protein interactions (e.g. nucleosomal perturbations) was distinguished from that due to the presence of unrestrained supercoiling in a region of interest. The heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) genes were wound with a significant level of superhelical tension that remained virtually unaltered whether or not the genes were transcriptionally activated by thermal elevation. Constitutively expressed 18S ribosomal RNA genes also exhibited unrestrained superhelical tension at a level comparable with that across hsp70. In contrast, flanking regions downstream of each of the divergent hsp70 genes at locus 87A7 exhibited substantially less tension. Thus the results point to the existence of stable, torsionally stressed topological domains within eukaryotic chromosomal DNA, suggesting that the relaxing action of topoisomerases is not ubiquitous throughout the nucleus but, in fact, is likely to be tightly regulated.

8280521|t|Balloon dilatation (valvoplasty) as first line treatment for severe stenosis of the aortic valve in early infancy: medium term results and determinants of survival.
8280521|a|OBJECTIVE--To assess the results of balloon dilatation of the aortic valve as first line treatment for infants presenting in the first two months of life with cardiac failure caused by severe aortic stenosis. DESIGN--A prospective study of all such infants presenting to a single centre over a three year period. PATIENTS--Of 14 consecutive infants aged < 2 months presenting with heart failure due to severe stenosis of the aortic valve, 12 underwent balloon dilatation of the valve. Two infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome were excluded. Six patients had other significant cardiac malformations, nine had endocardial fibroelastosis. Four infants were moribund at presentation. INTERVENTIONS--Balloon dilatation was performed through the femoral artery under general anaesthetic, with heparin and antibiotic prophylaxis. Maximum inflated balloon size was selected as equal to or slightly less than the diameter of the aortic valve measured echocardiographically. In two infants balloon dilatation of coexistent severe coarctation was performed at the same time. RESULTS--Dilatation was achieved in all cases. Early survival rate (up to one month) was 75%; 50% survive up to three years. The two deaths occurring < 24 hours after dilatation probably related to the infants' poor condition at presentation and the presence of significant left ventricular hypoplasia. The other early death was due to severe mitral regurgitation from papillary muscle dysfunction. All later deaths were related to associated malformations. The difference in left ventricular size (diameter and length) measured echocardiographically at presentation between survivors and those that died is significant (p < or = 0.002). 83% of deaths occurred in infants with associated malformations. Cusp perforation occurred in one infant, which may have contributed to this patient's death. Left ventricular perforation and cardiac tamponade were treated successfully by prompt pericardiocentesis in another. CONCLUSIONS--Balloon dilatation of the aortic valve is an acceptable first line treatment for neonates with severe symptomatic stenosis of the aortic valve. Outcome depends principally on left ventricular size and on the presence, severity, and timing of treatment of associated malformations. Severe endocardial fibroelastosis was not a risk factor for early death but may have implications for long term survival. The survival rate for this high risk group might be improved by a stratified approach where patients with adequate left ventricular size have balloon dilatation whereas those with severe ventricular hypoplasia are managed like patients with the hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

15613244|t|MAB21L2, a vertebrate member of the Male-abnormal 21 family, modulates BMP signaling and interacts with SMAD1.
15613244|a|BACKGROUND: Through in vivo loss-of-function studies, vertebrate members of the Male abnormal 21 (mab-21) gene family have been implicated in gastrulation, neural tube formation and eye morphogenesis. Despite mounting evidence of their considerable importance in development, the biochemical properties and nature of MAB-21 proteins have remained strikingly elusive. In addition, genetic studies conducted in C. elegans have established that in double mutants mab-21 is epistatic to genes encoding various members of a Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway involved in the formation of male-specific sensory organs. RESULTS: Through a gain-of-function approach, we analyze the interaction of Mab21l2 with a TGF-beta signaling pathway in early vertebrate development. We show that the vertebrate mab-21 homolog Mab21l2 antagonizes the effects of Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) overexpression in vivo, rescuing the dorsal axis and restoring wild-type distribution of Chordin and Xvent2 transcripts in Xenopus gastrulae. We show that MAB21L2 immunoprecipitates in vivo with the BMP4 effector SMAD1, whilst in vitro it binds SMAD1 and the SMAD1-SMAD4 complex. Finally, when targeted to an heterologous promoter, MAB21L2 acts as a transcriptional repressor. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first biochemical and cellular foundation for future functional studies of mab-21 genes in normal neural development and its pathological disturbances.

3266235|t|Autoimmune optic neuropathy: evaluation and treatment.
3266235|a|Fourteen patients, 12 of whom were women, with an age range from 26 to 56 years, presented with progressive or recurrent optic neuropathy, despite conventional doses of corticosteroid, and laboratory evidence of collagen vascular disease. The visual loss was severe and most had an acuity less than 20/200. Megadose corticosteroid therapy improved the vision in 11 of the 12 patients. Continued oral prednisone and cytotoxic drugs were necessary to maintain vision in nine patients. Patients with autoimmune optic neuropathy must be differentiated from cases with idiopathic optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis to facilitate the appropriate therapy.

17923670|t|Altered phase diagram due to a single point mutation in human gammaD-crystallin.
17923670|a|The P23T mutant of human gammaD-crystallin (HGD) is associated with cataract. We have previously investigated the solution properties of this mutant, as well as those of the closely related P23V and P23S mutants, and shown that although mutations at site 23 of HGD do not produce a significant structural change in the protein, they nevertheless profoundly alter the solubility of the protein. Remarkably, the solubility of the mutants decreases with increasing temperature, in sharp contrast to the behavior of the native protein. This inverted solubility corresponds to a strong increase in the binding energy with temperature. Here we have investigated the liquid-liquid coexistence curve and the diffusivity of the P23V mutant and find that these solution properties are unaffected by the mutation. This means that the chemical potentials in the solution phase are essentially unaltered. The apparent discrepancy between the interaction energies in the solution phase, as compared with the solid phase, is explicable in terms of highly anisotropic interprotein interactions, which are averaged out in the solution phase but are fully engaged in the solid phase.

2333287|t|Topography of toxin-acetylcholine receptor complexes by using photoactivatable toxin derivatives.
2333287|a|We have defined the molecular environment of a snake neurotoxin interacting with the high- and low-affinity binding sites of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR). This was done by photocoupling reactions using three toxin derivatives with photoactivatable moieties on Lys-15, Lys-47, and Lys-51. Competition data showed that Lys-47 belongs to the toxin-AcChoR interacting domain whereas the other two residues are excluded from it. We first tentatively determined the threshold of covalent coupling, indicative of the proximity between the photoactivatable probes and subunits, by quantifying the coupling occurring between the same derivatives and a model compound (i.e., a toxin-specific monoclonal antibody). We then (i) quantified the coupling yields occurring when both binding sites of AcChoR were occupied by the toxin derivatives, (ii) discriminately quantified the coupling yields at the high-affinity binding site, and (iii) deduced the coupling yields at the low-affinity binding site. In the high-affinity site, the probes on Lys-15 and Lys-47 predominantly reacted with the high-affinity site of the AcChoR alpha subunit whereas the probe on Lys-51 reacted with the delta subunit. In the low-affinity site, the probe on Lys-47 predominantly reacted with the low-affinity site of the alpha chain and the beta chain whereas those on Lys-15 and Lys-51 reacted with the gamma and delta chains, respectively. A three-dimensional model showing a unique organization of AcChoR bound to two toxin molecules is presented.

4316376|t|The development of glyoxysomes in peanut cotyledons and maize scutella.
4316376|a|The development of glyoxysomes during germination has been studied in isolated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cotyledons and in maize (Zea mays L.) scutella. In peanut cotyledons isocitratase, malate synthetase, and protein associated with the glyoxysomal fraction increase simultaneously from the 3rd to the 8th day of incubation. In scutella of germinating maize seeds the specific activities of isocitratase, malate synthetase, and catalase associated with the glyoxysomes rise until the 4th day of germination and then decline while the total amount of protein present in the fraction stays constant during the first 5 days. If the peanut cotyledons are cultured in 2% glucose, the development of isocitratase and malate synthetase is severely inhibited, but the level of the glyoxysomal protein is not measurably affected.

8223481|t|Functional domains of the human splicing factor ASF/SF2.
8223481|a|The human splicing factor ASF/SF2 displays two predominant activities in in vitro splicing assays: (i) it is an essential factor apparently required for all splices and (ii) it is able to switch utilization of alternative 5' splice sites in a concentration-dependent manner. ASF/SF2 is the prototype of a family of proteins typified by the presence of one or two RNP-type RNA binding domains (RBDs) and a region highly enriched in repeating arginine-serine dipeptides (RS regions). Here we describe a functional analysis of ASF/SF2, which defines several regions essential for one, or both, of its two principal activities, and provides insights into how this type of protein functions in splicing. Two isoforms of the protein, which arise from alternative splicing, are by themselves inactive, but each can block the activity of ASF/SF2, thereby functioning as splicing repressors. Some, but not all, mutations in the RS region prevent ASF/SF2 from functioning as an essential splicing factor. However, the entire RS region can be deleted without reducing splice site switching activity, indicating that it is not absolutely required for interaction with other splicing factors. Experiments with deletion and substitution mutants reveal that the protein contains two related, but highly diverged, RBDs, and that both are essential for activity. Each RBD by itself retains the ability to bind RNA, although optimal binding requires both domains.

5436330|a|Compatible and incompatible pollen tubes growing on detached Lilium longiflorum pistils which had been prelabeled with myoinositol-U-(14)C take up a portion of the label and utilize it for biosynthesis of tube wall substance. The label is transferred from pistil to pollen tubes apparently via the secretion products (exudate) of the pistil. The exudate thus appears to have a major nutritional role in pollen tube growth in vivo.

10712678|t|Interferon-gamma plays a critical role in intestinal immunity against Salmonella typhimurium infection.
10712678|a|Salmonella bacteria are a major cause of food-borne infectious diarrhoea and there is great interest in understanding the pathogenesis of Salmonella infection and in vaccine development. Potential vaccines include the aromatic mutants of S. typhimurium. Such non-lethal Aro mutants have also been useful for studying Salmonella infections in mouse models. Studies of systemic infection, using these Aro mutants, in both normal and cytokine gene knockout mice, indicate that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plays a key role in the resolution of Salmonella infection. The present studies have investigated the outcome of oral infection in mice with attenuated Salmonella because this infection route mimics natural infection in humans. In IFN-gamma gene knockout (IFN-gamma-/-) mice, intestinal immunity was impaired and oral challenge resulted in disseminated septicaemia 2 weeks later. No dissemination of infection was seen in wild-type mice. In wild-type mice, both CD4 and CD8 cell numbers increased in the gut following Salmonella challenge, together with increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). No such changes were seen in IFNgamma-/- mice. Following oral challenge, antilipopolysaccharide (LPS) and antiphosphoryl choline antibodies increased by more than 100-fold in both serum and faecal pellet extracts of IFNgamma-/- mice compared with wild-type mice. Our data show that IFN-gamma production is essential for resolution of enteric Salmonella infection and that antibody has little effect on this process.

18483265|t|A small molecule disruptor of Rb/Raf-1 interaction inhibits cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and growth of human tumor xenografts in nude mice.
18483265|a|Although it is well established that cyclin-dependent kinases phosphorylate and inactivate Rb, the Raf-1 kinase physically interacts with Rb and initiates the phosphorylation cascade early in the cell cycle. We have identified an orally active small molecule, Rb/Raf-1 disruptor 251 (RRD-251), that potently and selectively disrupts the Rb/Raf-1 but not Rb/E2F, Rb/prohibitin, Rb/cyclin E, and Rb/HDAC binding. The selective inhibition of Rb/Raf-1 binding suppressed the ability of Rb to recruit Raf-1 to proliferative promoters and inhibited E2F1-dependent transcriptional activity. RRD-251 inhibited anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of human cancer cells and knockdown of Rb with short hairpin RNA or forced expression of E2F1 rescued cells from RRD-251-mediated growth arrest. P.o. treatment of mice resulted in significant tumor growth suppression only in tumors with functional Rb, and this was accompanied by inhibition of angiogenesis, inhibition of proliferation, decreased phosphorylated Rb levels, and inhibition of Rb/Raf-1 but not Rb/E2F1 binding in vivo. Thus, selective targeting of Rb/Raf-1 interaction seems to be a promising approach for developing novel chemotherapeutic agents.

11604532|t|Identification of disulfide-linked peptides by isotope profiles produced by peptic digestion of proteins in 50% (18)O water.
11604532|a|Determination of the disulfide-bond arrangement of a protein by characterization of disulfide-linked peptides in proteolytic digests may be complicated by resistance of the protein to specific proteases, disulfide interchange, and/or production of extremely complex mixtures by less specific proteolysis. In this study, mass spectrometry has been used to show that incorporation of (18)O into peptides during peptic digestion of disulfide-linked proteins in 50% (18)O water resulted in isotope patterns and increases in average masses that facilitated identification and characterization of disulfide-linked peptides even in complex mixtures, without the need for reference digests in 100% (16)O water. This is exemplified by analysis of peptic digests of model proteins lysozyme and ribonuclease A (RNaseA) by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS). Distinct isotope profiles were evident when two peptide chains were linked by disulfide bonds, provided one of the chains did not contain the C terminus of the protein. This latter class of peptide, and single-chain peptides containing an intrachain disulfide bond, could be identified and characterized by mass shifts produced by reduction. Reduction also served to confirm other assignments. Isotope profiling of peptic digests showed that disulfide-linked peptides were often enriched in the high molecular weight fractions produced by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the digests. Applicability of these procedures to analysis of a more complex disulfide-bond arrangement was shown with the hemagglutinin/neuraminidase of Newcastle disease virus.

18450927|t|Computer-assisted delivery of cognitive-behavioral therapy for addiction: a randomized trial of CBT4CBT.
18450927|a|OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the efficacy of a computer-based version of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for substance dependence. METHOD: This was a randomized clinical trial in which 77 individuals seeking treatment for substance dependence at an outpatient community setting were randomly assigned to standard treatment or standard treatment with biweekly access to computer-based training in CBT (CBT4CBT) skills. RESULTS: Treatment retention and data availability were comparable across the treatment conditions. Participants assigned to the CBT4CBT condition submitted significantly more urine specimens that were negative for any type of drugs and tended to have longer continuous periods of abstinence during treatment. The CBT4CBT program was positively evaluated by participants. In the CBT4CBT condition, outcome was more strongly associated with treatment engagement than in treatment as usual; furthermore, completion of homework assignments in CBT4CBT was significantly correlated with outcome and a significant predictor of treatment involvement. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CBT4CBT is an effective adjunct to standard outpatient treatment for substance dependence and may provide an important means of making CBT, an empirically validated treatment, more broadly available.

5695066|t|Production of enterotoxin A in milk.
5695066|a|Enterotoxin A production in milk was studied by use of variables of milk quality, initial numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci, incubation temperature, and time. In both raw and pasteurized milks having a low total viable count, enterotoxin was detected in minimal incubation times of 6 to 9 hr at 35 C, 9 to 12 hr at 30 C, 18 hr at 25 C, and 36 hr at 20 C, after inoculation with 10(6)Staphylococcus aureus cells per ml. When similar milks were inoculated with 10(4)S. aureus cells per ml, enterotoxin was detected in 12 hr at 35 C, 18 hr at 30 C, 24 to 36 hr at 25 C, and 48 to 96 hr at 20 C. In high-count raw milk, enterotoxin was detected only in samples inoculated with 10(6)S. aureus cells per ml and incubated at 35 C. Generally, a concentration of 5 x 10(7)S. aureus cells per ml of milk was reached before enterotoxin A was detected.

15155376|t|Eukaryotic cells and their cell bodies: Cell Theory revised.
15155376|a|BACKGROUND: Cell Theory, also known as cell doctrine, states that all eukaryotic organisms are composed of cells, and that cells are the smallest independent units of life. This Cell Theory has been influential in shaping the biological sciences ever since, in 1838/1839, the botanist Matthias Schleiden and the zoologist Theodore Schwann stated the principle that cells represent the elements from which all plant and animal tissues are constructed. Some 20 years later, in a famous aphorism Omnis cellula e cellula, Rudolf Virchow annunciated that all cells arise only from pre-existing cells. General acceptance of Cell Theory was finally possible only when the cellular nature of brain tissues was confirmed at the end of the 20th century. Cell Theory then rapidly turned into a more dogmatic cell doctrine, and in this form survives up to the present day. In its current version, however, the generalized Cell Theory developed for both animals and plants is unable to accommodate the supracellular nature of higher plants, which is founded upon a super-symplasm of interconnected cells into which is woven apoplasm, symplasm and super-apoplasm. Furthermore, there are numerous examples of multinucleate coenocytes and syncytia found throughout the eukaryote superkingdom posing serious problems for the current version of Cell Theory. SCOPE: To cope with these problems, we here review data which conform to the original proposal of Daniel Mazia that the eukaryotic cell is composed of an elemental Cell Body whose structure is smaller than the cell and which is endowed with all the basic attributes of a living entity. A complement to the Cell Body is the Cell Periphery Apparatus, which consists of the plasma membrane associated with other periphery structures. Importantly, boundary structures of the Cell Periphery Apparatus, although capable of some self-assembly, are largely produced and maintained by Cell Body activities and can be produced from it de novo. These boundary structures serve not only as mechanical support for the Cell Bodies but they also protect them from the hostile external environment and from inappropriate interactions with adjacent Cell Bodies within the organism. CONCLUSIONS: From the evolutionary perspective, Cell Bodies of eukaryotes are proposed to represent vestiges of hypothetical, tubulin-based 'guest' proto-cells. After penetrating the equally hypothetical actin-based 'host' proto-cells, tubulin-based 'guests' became specialized for transcribing, storing and partitioning DNA molecules via the organization of microtubules. The Cell Periphery Apparatus, on the other hand, represents vestiges of the actin-based 'host' proto-cells which have become specialized for Cell Body protection, shape control, motility and for actin-mediated signalling across the plasma membrane.

10398682|t|Crystal structure of the conserved core of the herpes simplex virus transcriptional regulatory protein VP16.
10398682|a|On infection, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) virion protein VP16 (Vmw65; alphaTIF) forms a transcriptional regulatory complex-the VP16-induced complex-with two cellular proteins, HCF and Oct-1, on VP16-responsive cis-regulatory elements in HSV immediate-early promoters called TAATGARAT. Comparison of different HSV VP16 sequences reveals a conserved core region that is sufficient for VP16-induced complex formation. The crystal structure of the VP16 core has been determined at 2.1 A resolution. The results reveal a novel, seat-like protein structure. Together with the activity of mutant VP16 proteins, the structure of free VP16 suggests that it contains (1) a disordered carboxy-terminal region that associates with HCF, Oct-1, and DNA in the VP16-induced complex, and (2) a structured region involved in virion assembly and possessing a novel DNA-binding surface that differentiates among TAATGARAT VP16-response elements.

17383950|t|Loss of myostatin (GDF8) function increases osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells but the osteogenic effect is ablated with unloading.
17383950|a|Myostatin (GDF8) is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth and mice lacking myostatin show a significant increase in muscle mass and bone density compared to normal mice. In order to further define the role of myostatin in regulating bone mass we sought to determine if loss of myostatin function significantly altered the potential for osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and in vivo. We first examined expression of the myostatin receptor, the type IIB activin receptor (AcvrIIB), in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from mouse long bones. This receptor was found to be expressed at high levels in BMSCs, and we were also able to detect AcvrIIB protein in BMSCs in situ using immunofluorescence. BMSCs isolated from myostatin-deficient mice showed increased osteogenic differentiation compared to wild-type mice; however, treatment of BMSCs from myostatin-deficient mice with recombinant myostatin did not attenuate the osteogenic differentiation of these cells. Loading of BMSCs in vitro increased the expression of osteogenic factors such as BMP-2 and IGF-1, but treatment of BMSCs with recombinant myostatin was found to decrease the expression of these factors. We investigated the effects of myostatin loss-of-function on the differentiation of BMSCs in vivo using hindlimb unloading (7-day tail suspension). Unloading caused a greater increase in marrow adipocyte number, and a greater decrease in osteoblast number, in myostatin-deficient mice than in normal mice. These data suggest that the increased osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs from mice lacking myostatin is load-dependent, and that myostatin may alter the mechanosensitivity of BMSCs by suppressing the expression of osteogenic factors during mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, although myostatin deficiency increases muscle mass and bone strength, it does not prevent muscle and bone catabolism with unloading.

2845135|t|Expression of bovine herpesvirus 1 glycoproteins gI and gIII in transfected murine cells.
2845135|a|Genes encoding two of the major glycoproteins of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), gI and gIII, were cloned into the eucaryotic expression vectors pRSVcat and pSV2neo and transfected into murine LMTK- cells, and cloned cell lines were established. The relative amounts of gI or gIII expressed from the two vectors were similar. Expression of gI was cell associated and localized predominantly in the perinuclear region, but nuclear and plasma membrane staining was also observed. Expression of gI was additionally associated with cell fusion and the formation of polykaryons and giant cells. Expression of gIII was localized predominantly in the nuclear and plasma membranes. Radioimmunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of tunicamycin revealed that the recombinant glycoproteins were proteolytically processed and glycosylated and had molecular weights similar to those of the forms of gI and gIII expressed in BHV-1-infected bovine cells. However, both recombinant glycoproteins were glycosylated to a lesser extent than were the forms found in BHV-1-infected bovine cells. For gI, a deficiency in N-linked glycosylation of the amino-terminal half of the protein was identified; for gIII, a deficiency in O-linked glycosylation was implicated. The reactivity pattern of a panel of gI- and gIII-specific monoclonal antibodies, including six which recognize conformation-dependent epitopes, was found to be unaffected by the glycosylation differences and was identical for transfected or BHV-1-infected murine cells. Use of the transfected cells as targets in immune-mediated cytotoxicity assays demonstrated the functional recognition of recombinant gI and gIII by murine antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Immunization of mice with the transfected cells elicited BHV-1-specific virus-neutralizing antibody, thus verifying the antigenic authenticity of the recombinant glycoproteins and the important role of gI and gIII as targets of the immune response to BHV-1 in this murine model system.

12734256|t|Identification and characterization of a new variant of Shiga toxin 1 in Escherichia coli ONT:H19 of bovine origin.
12734256|a|A new variant of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1), designated Stx1d, which deviates considerably more than any other known variant from Stx1 encoded by phage 933J, was identified in an Escherichia coli strain, ONT:H19, isolated from bovine feces. The complete stx(1) gene of this strain was amplified and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence homology with stx(1) from phage 933J was only 91%, resulting in the substitution of 20 amino acids in the A subunit and 7 amino acids in the B subunit of the protein. Cell culture supernatant of this strain, which was negative for stx(2) by PCR testing, was cytotoxic to Vero cells and gave positive results in two commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for Stx. PCR primers were constructed for the specific detection of the new variant. The findings of this study suggest that Stx1 is not as conserved as thought before and that there might be more variants which cannot be detected by commonly used PCR methods.

2492104|t|Structure of the NGFI-A gene and detection of upstream sequences responsible for its transcriptional induction by nerve growth factor.
2492104|a|The NGFI-A gene encodes a "zinc-finger" protein that is rapidly induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. The complete exon/intron organization and nucleotide sequence of the rat NGFI-A gene have been determined. The gene spans 3789 nucleotides (nt) and is interrupted by a single intron at nt 588. All three zinc-finger DNA-binding domains are contiguously coded for within the 3' exon; this is in contrast to the structure described by others for the Xenopus laevis transcription factor TFIIIA gene. To analyze the transcription of this gene, we have determined the transcription start site and nucleotide sequence of the 5' flanking region. Transfection of PC12 cells with a fragment from the 5' flanking region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene revealed that it contains an element which imparts an NGF-inducible phenotype to the normally silent CAT gene. Several regions with homologies to recognizable sequence elements are present in this fragment, including a TATA box at nt -27, serum response elements at nt -84, -106, -370, and -408, a cAMP-responsive element at nt -140, and a transcription factor Sp1-binding site at nt -286. These results establish the genomic structure of this mammalian multifinger protein and demonstrate that an NGF-responsive element lies upstream of the NGFI-A gene.

7044960|t|Sites of autoantibody production in rats with thyroiditis.
7044960|a|We have developed a thyroglobulin-specific haemolytic plaque assay and investigated potential sites of autoantibody synthesis in good and poor responder strains of rats immunized with thyroglobulin and in rats subjected to thymectomy and sub-lethal irradiation which subsequently develop thyroiditis spontaneously. The bone marrow appears to be the most important site of thyroglobulin antibody synthesis in all groups, but spleen and cervical lymph nodes are also involved. No thyroglobulin plaque-forming cells could be found in the thyroid. These results imply widespread involvement of the humoral immune system in organ-specific autoimmune processes.

7125683|t|Natural history of egg hypersensitivity.
7125683|a|Twenty-five children with clinical egg hypersensitivity, confirmed by double-blind challenge, were followed for between 2 and 2 1/2 years. Clinical egg hypersensitivity was fund to have resolved in 11 children but was persistent in 14. Skin prick tests reactions to egg were initially of equivalent size in the resolved and persistent groups, but became negative or diminished in size with resolution of clinical egg hypersensitivity, while remaining positive in the group with persisting symptoms. Symptoms after egg ingestion were categorised as cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and angioedema. The adverse reactions of the resolved group were either cutaneous or gastrointestinal symptoms. The persisting group had multisystem involvement and most of them developed angioedema and respiratory symptoms. These differences may be useful as prognostic indicators in clinical egg hypersensitivity.

3415237|t|Efficacy of chemical dosing methods for isolating nontuberculous mycobacteria from water supplies of dialysis centers.
3415237|a|Investigations of nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections associated with various environmental sources have been hampered by the lack of adequate techniques for selective isolation of these organisms from environmental fluids. This study compared chemical dosing techniques for recovery of NTM from water samples collected from 115 randomly selected dialysis centers. Cell suspensions of NTM group II and IV isolates and gram-negative bacteria were exposed to solutions containing sodium hypochlorite (0.2 micrograms/ml of free available chlorine), formaldehyde (1, 0.75, or 0.5%), oxalic acid (1.25%), cetylpyridinium chloride (25 micrograms/ml), or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (100 micrograms/ml). Results of standard membrane filtration assays with laboratory test strains and water samples from dialysis centers showed that 5 min of exposure to 1% formaldehyde effectively reduced gram-negative bacterial populations and allowed increased recovery of NTM in environmental fluids containing mixed microbial populations.

Bacteriol. 85:1088-1093. 1963.-Mice exposed to 425 r total body irradiation failed to become tolerant to Candida albicans toxicity after injection with lipopolysaccharide. Mice injected with lipopolysaccharide and then X-rayed did not demonstrate the tolerant state. An injection of thorium dioxide in mice that had previously received tolerance-inducing amounts of lipopolysaccharide rendered them as susceptible to acute C. albicans toxicity as control mice. A bimodal manifestation of tolerance was noted. Groups of mice given single injections of lipopolysaccharide at 6 or 1 days before challenge demonstrated high levels of tolerance, whereas the tolerance in mice given a single dose at 3 days was negligible. The bimodal effect was not observed in tolerant mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide. Injections of viable or nonviable pathogenic fungi known to produce tolerance to the toxicity of C. albicans in recipient mice did not produce tolerance to lipopolysaccharide. Serum from mice injected with lipopolysaccharide showed in vitro inhibitory activity for C. albicans.

18816975|t|Using real-time visual feedback to improve posture at computer workstations.
18816975|a|The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of a multicomponent intervention that included discrimination training, real-time visual feedback, and self-monitoring on postural behavior at a computer workstation in a simulated office environment. Using a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across 8 participants, the study assessed the effects of the intervention across three postural variables. Following an information phase, the intervention started for the lowest stable postural variable. The intervention led to substantial improvements in safety behavior for most targeted postural variables. A reversal to the information phase for 2 participants did not lead to decreases in safety. Postures self-monitored with high accuracy improved to a greater degree than postures self-monitored with low accuracy.

6202881|t|Characterization of a Rous sarcoma virus mutant defective in packaging its own genomic RNA: biochemical properties of mutant TK15 and mutant-induced transformants.
6202881|a|The accompanying paper (S. Kawai and T. Koyama , J. Virol. 51:147-153, 1984) describes the isolation and biological properties of a mutant, TK15 , derived from a Rous sarcoma virus mutant, tsNY68 . The cis-acting defect of the mutant is analyzed biochemically in this paper. TK15 virions released from virus-producing 15c (+) cells were deficient in viral genomic 39S RNA, although comparable amounts of viral RNAs were transcribed in 15c (+) and tsNY68 -infected cells. Analysis of provirus DNA occurring in 15c (+) cells suggested that the mutant genome had a deletion of ca. 250 bases near the 5' end of the genome somewhere between the primer binding site and the 5' end of the gag-coding region. These findings indicate that at least part of the sequence lost in the TK15 genome is indispensable for packaging viral genomic RNA into virions. TK15 induces nonvirus -producing 15c (-) transformants at high frequency. Southern blot analysis of DNAs from those 15c (-) clone cells revealed that TK15 -derived proviruses contained various extents of internal deletions. Many 15c (-) clones had a provirus carrying only the src gene with long terminal repeat sequences at both ends. The mechanism for the segregation of 15c (-) cells is discussed.

3985239|t|Does a vegetarian diet reduce the occurrence of diabetes?
3985239|a|We propose the hypothesis that a vegetarian diet reduces the risk of developing diabetes. Findings that have generated this hypothesis are from a population of 25,698 adult White Seventh-day Adventists identified in 1960. During 21 years of follow-up, the risk of diabetes as an underlying cause of death in Adventists was approximately one-half the risk for all US Whites. Within the male Adventist population, vegetarians had a substantially lower risk than non-vegetarians of diabetes as an underlying or contributing cause of death. Within both the male and female Adventist populations, the prevalence of self-reported diabetes also was lower in vegetarians than in non-vegetarians. The associations observed between diabetes and meat consumption were apparently not due to confounding by over- or under-weight, other selected dietary factors, or physical activity. All of the associations between meat consumption and diabetes were stronger in males than in females.

11402218|t|Cloning and expression pattern of a gene encoding an alpha-xylosidase active against xyloglucan oligosaccharides from Arabidopsis.
11402218|a|An alpha-xylosidase active against xyloglucan oligosaccharides was purified from cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) leaves. Two peptide sequences were obtained from this protein, the N-terminal and an internal one, and these were used to identify an Arabidopsis gene coding for an alpha-xylosidase that we propose to call AtXYL1. It has been mapped to a region of chromosome I between markers at 100.44 and 107.48 cM. AtXYL1 comprised three exons and encoded a peptide that was 915 amino acids long, with a potential signal peptide of 22 amino acids and eight possible N-glycosylation sites. The protein encoded by AtXYL1 showed the signature regions of family 31 glycosyl hydrolases, which comprises not only alpha-xylosidases, but also alpha-glucosidases. The alpha-xylosidase activity is present in apoplastic extractions from Arabidopsis seedlings, as suggested by the deduced signal peptide. The first eight leaves from Arabidopsis plants were harvested to analyze alpha-xylosidase activity and AtXYL1 expression levels. Both increased from older to younger leaves, where xyloglucan turnover is expected to be higher. When this gene was introduced in a suitable expression vector and used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae, significantly higher alpha-xylosidase activity was detected in the yeast cells. alpha-Glucosidase activity was also increased in the transformed cells, although to a lesser extent. These results show that AtXYL1 encodes for an apoplastic alpha-xylosidase active against xyloglucan oligosaccharides that probably also has activity against p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucoside.

7500013|t|A hypoxia-responsive element mediates a novel pathway of activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase promoter.
7500013|a|Picolinic acid, a catabolite of L-tryptophan, activates the transcription of the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS) in IFN-gamma-treated murine macrophages. We performed functional studies on the 5' flanking region of the iNOS gene linked to a CAT reporter gene to identify the cis-acting element(s) responsible for the activation of iNOS transcription by picolinic acid. Transient transfection assays showed that the full-length iNOS promoter in the murine macrophage cell line ANA-1 was activated by the synergistic interaction between IFN-gamma and picolinic acid. Deletion or mutation of the iNOS promoter region from -227 to -209, containing a sequence homology to a hypoxia-responsive enhancer (iNOS-HRE), decreased picolinic acid- but not LPS-induced CAT activity by more than 70%. Functional studies using a tk promoter-CAT reporter gene plasmid demonstrated that the iNOS-HRE was sufficient to confer inducibility by picolinic acid but not by IFN-gamma or LPS. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that picolinic acid alone induced a specific binding activity to the iNOS-HRE. Furthermore, we found that the iNOS-HRE activity was inducible by hypoxia and that hypoxia in combination with IFN-gamma activated the iNOS promoter in transient transfection assays and induced iNOS transcription and mRNA expression. These data establish that the iNOS-HRE is a novel regulatory element of the iNOS promoter activity in murine macrophages and provide the first evidence that iNOS is a hypoxia-inducible gene.

16203911|t|Remodeling in cells from different regions of the reentrant circuit during ventricular tachycardia.
16203911|a|BACKGROUND: Anisotropic reentrant excitation occurs in the remodeled substrate of the epicardial border zone (EBZ) of the 5-day infarcted canine heart. Reentry is stabilized because of the formation of functional lines of block. We hypothesized that regional differences of ionic currents in cells of the EBZ form these lines of block. Therefore, we first mapped reentrant circuits of sustained tachycardias, then dispersed cells (infarct zone cells, IZs) from the central common pathway of the circuit (IZc) as well as from the other side of the line of block (outer pathway, IZo) for study. METHODS AND RESULTS: We mapped reentrant circuits in the EBZ of infarcted hearts during sustained ventricular tachycardias (>30 seconds, n=17 episodes, cycle lengths=218+/-7.9 ms). INa density was reduced in both IZc and IZo, and the kinetic properties of IZc INa were markedly altered versus IZo. Structural remodeling of the sodium channel protein Nav1.5 occurred in IZs, with cell surface localization differing from normal cells. Both IZc and IZo have similar but reduced ICaL, whereas IZc showed changes in Ca2+ current kinetics with an acceleration of current decay. Computer simulations of the 2D EBZ showed that incorporating only differences between INa in IZc and IZo prevented stability of the reentrant circuit. Incorporating only differences between ICaL in the IZc and IZo cells also prevented stability of the circuit. However, incorporating both INa and ICaL current differences stabilized the simulated reentrant circuit, and lines of block formed between the 2 distinct regions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in INa and ICaL properties in cells of the center and outer pathways of a reentrant circuit, the resulting changes in effective refractory periods tend to stabilize reentry in this remodeled substrate.

11270442|t|Slow and fast visual motion channels have independent binocular-rivalry stages.
11270442|a|We have previously reported a transparent motion after-effect indicating that the human visual system comprises separate slow and fast motion channels. Here, we report that the presentation of a fast motion in one eye and a slow motion in the other eye does not result in binocular rivalry but in a clear percept of transparent motion. We call this new visual phenomenon 'dichoptic motion transparency' (DMT). So far only the DMT phenomenon and the two motion after-effects (the 'classical' motion after-effect, seen after motion adaptation on a static test pattern, and the dynamic motion after-effect, seen on a dynamic-noise test pattern) appear to isolate the channels completely. The speed ranges of the slow and fast channels overlap strongly and are observer dependent. A model is presented that links after-effect durations of an observer to the probability of rivalry or DMT as a function of dichoptic velocity combinations. Model results support the assumption of two highly independent channels showing only within-channel rivalry, and no rivalry or after-effect interactions between the channels. The finding of two independent motion vision channels, each with a separate rivalry stage and a private line to conscious perception, might be helpful in visualizing or analysing pathways to consciousness.

17520196|t|Molecular genetics of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia.
17520196|a|BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that noninvasive precursor lesions, classified as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), can progress to invasive pancreatic cancer. This review will discuss the major genetic alterations in PanIN lesions. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed in order to find studies on the molecular profile of human PanIN lesions. In addition, recent publications on genetically engineered mouse models of preinvasive neoplasia and pancreatic cancers were reviewed. RESULTS: PanINs demonstrate abnormalities at the genomic (DNA), transcriptomic (RNA), and proteomic levels, and there is a progressive accumulation of molecular alterations that accompany the histological progression from low-grade PanIN-1A to high-grade PanIN-3 lesions. Molecular changes in PanINs can be classified as "early" (KRAS2 mutations, telomere shortening, p21(WAF1/CIP1) up-regulation, etc.), "intermediate" (cyclin D1 up-regulation, expression of proliferation antigens, etc.), or "late" (BRCA2 and TP53 mutations, DPC4/SMAD4/MADH4 inactivation, etc.). All the genetic changes observed in PanINs are also found in invasive ductal adenocarcinomas, where they usually occur at a higher frequency. Genetically engineered mice expressing mutant Kras in the pancreas, with or without additional genetic alterations, provide a unique in vivo platform to study the pancreatic cancer progression model. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular studies have been instrumental in establishing that PanIN lesions are the noninvasive precursors for invasive ductal adenocarcinomas. The availability of molecular date provides the basis for designing rational early detection strategies and therapeutic intervention trials before pancreatic neoplasms invade, with the intention of alleviating the dismal prognosis associated with this disease.

2419757|t|GTP-binding proteins mediate transmitter inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels.
2419757|a|The modulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by hormones and neurotransmitters has important implications for the control of many Ca2+-dependent cellular functions including exocytosis and contractility. We made use of electrophysiological techniques, including whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones, to demonstrate a role for GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) as signal transducers in the noradrenaline- and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels. This action of the transmitters was blocked by: (1) preincubation of the cells with pertussis toxin (a bacterial exotoxin catalysing ADP-ribosylation of G-proteins); or (2) intracellular administration of guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-beta-S), a non-hydrolysable analogue of GDP that competitively inhibits the binding of GTP to G-proteins. Our findings provide the first direct demonstration of the G-protein-mediated inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels by neurotransmitters. This mode of transmitter action may explain the ability of noradrenaline and GABA to presynaptically inhibit Ca2+-dependent neurosecretion from DRG sensory neurones.

3487774|t|A joining-diversity-joining complex generated by inversion mechanism and a variable-diversity complex in the beta-chain gene of the human T-cell receptor.
3487774|a|We have analysed an inactive allele of the beta-chain gene of the T-cell receptor in a human T-cell line HPB-ALL. Comparison with germline sequences showed that HPB-ALL has a joining (J)-diversity (D)-J complex recombined in head-to-head configuration and a variable (V)-D complex in tail-to-tail configuration. These results demonstrate that the inversion mechanism functions in the beta-chain gene of the T-cell receptor. The presence of the V-D complex suggests that V-D recombination could occur prior to D-J recombination although there is no definite proof that the V-D complex is an intermediate to form the V-D-J complex.

2549968|t|Proteolytic processing of a coleopteran-specific delta-endotoxin produced by Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis.
2549968|a|Insecticidal protein delta-endotoxin crystals harvested from sporulated cultures of Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis contain a major polypeptide of 67 kDa and minor polypeptides of 73, 72, 55 and 46 kDa. During sporulation, only the 73 kDa polypeptide could be detected at stage I. The 67 kDa polypeptide was first detected at stage II and increased in concentration throughout the later stages of sporulation and after crystal release, with a concomitant decrease in the 73 kDa polypeptide. This change could be blocked by the addition of proteinase inhibitors. Trypsin or insect-gut-extract treatment of the delta-endotoxin crystals after solubilization resulted in a cleavage product of 55 kDa with asparagine-159 of the deduced amino acid sequence of the toxin [Hofte, Seurinck, van Houtven & Vaeck (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15, 71-83; Sekar, Thompson, Maroney, Bookland & Adang (1987) Proc.

7271273|t|Plasma disappearance, urine excretion, and tissue distribution of ribavirin in rats and rhesus monkeys.
7271273|a|Ribavirin has been shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral. To study its tissue distribution and disappearance rate, a single dose of 10 mg/kg which contained 10 microCi of [14C]ribavirin was injected intravenously into rhesus monkeys and intramuscularly into monkeys and rats. Except for peak plasma concentrations and the initial phases of the plasma disappearance and urine excretion curves, no significant difference was observed between plasma, tissue, or urine values for intramuscularly or intravenously injected monkeys. Plasma disappearance curves were triphasic; plasma concentrations of ribavirin were similar for both monkeys and rats. Rats excreted ribavirin in the urine more rapidly and to a greater extent (82% excreted in 24 h) than did monkeys (60% excreted in 72 h). In the rat, only 3% of the injected [14C]ribavirin was detected in expired CO2. Therefore, for both species, urine was the major route for the elimination of labeled ribavirin and its metabolites from the body. In monkeys, the amount of parent drug in blood cells increased through 48 h and remained stable for 72 h, whereas in rats, ribavirin decreased at a rate similar to the plasma disappearance curve. Concentrations of ribavirin at 8 h were consistently higher in monkeys than in rats for all tissues except the brain. Thus, these differences in blood cellular components and organ content and in urine excretion suggested that there was greater tissue retention of ribavirin in monkeys than in rats.

17722549|t|Sustained release of acyclovir from nano-liposomes and nano-niosomes: an in vitro study.
17722549|a|The present study was designed to develop and compare acyclovir containing nano-vesicular liposomes and niosomes based on cholesterol, soya L-alpha-lecithin and nonionic surfactant, span 20. The effort was made to study in vitro whether acyclovir-loaded nanovesicles could sustain the release of the drug by increasing residence time and thus, acyclovir could reduce its dose-related systemic toxicity. There were good vesicular distributions in both of the niosomes and the liposomes. The obtained vesicles were within 1 microm and about 35% of them were within a size of 100 nm. The percentage of drug loading varied and the niosomal vesicles contained more drug as compared with the liposomes. When the in vitro drug release was compared, it was found that the liposomes released about 90% drug in 150 min whereas the drug release was just 50% from the niosomal vesicles in 200 min. Again, the niosomes showed better stability compared with the liposomes. Thus, niosome could be a better choice for intravenous delivery of acyclovir.

5441538|t|Hemolysis of "stress" reticulocytes: a source of erythropoietic bilirubin formation.
5441538|a|The formation of bilirubin-(14)C was measured in rats given transfusions of red blood cells containing (14)C-labeled hemoglobin heme. Per cent conversion of hemoglobin-(14)C to bilirubin was 4 times greater with transfusion of "stress" reticulocytes from rats responding to hemorrhage than with normal reticulocytes from unstimulated donors. When the increased number of labeled reticulocytes produced by hemorrhaged donors was also considered, the total magnitude of labeled bilirubin formation was almost 20 times higher with stress as compared to normal reticulocytes. The findings were not influenced by splenectomy of either donor or recipient rats, iron loading of donors, or bleeding of recipients. However, bilirubin-(14)C formation fell off progressively as studies were performed at longer intervals after erythroid stimulation. Total bilirubin-(14)C formation in rats transfused with stress reticulocytes was compared to the production of early-labeled bilirubin from all potential sources in intact rats bled according to the same schedule used in the transfusion experiments. It is estimated that degradation of hemoglobin from sress reticulocytes accounts for virtually the entire rise in erythropoietic bilirubin formation from 24 to 96 hr after glycine-2-(14)C administration, but that additional sources make a major contribution before that time. These findings are consistent with the concept that destruction of immature erythroid cells in the peripheral blood, and probably in the bone marrow, accompanies the physiologic response to erythroid stimulation.

12860923|t|Molecular mechanism for ATP-dependent closure of the K+ channel Kir6.2.
12860923|a|In the ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channel pore-forming protein Kir6.2, mutation of three positively charged residues, R50, K185 and R201, impairs the ability of ATP to close the channel. The mutations do not change the channel open probability (Po) in the absence of ATP, supporting the involvement of these residues in ATP binding. We recently proposed that at least two of these positively charged residues, K185 and R201, interact with ATP phosphate groups to cause channel closure: the beta phosphate group of ATP interacts with K185 to initiate closure, while the alpha phosphate interacts with R201 to stabilize the channel's closed state. In the present study we replaced these three positive residues with residues of different charge, size and hydropathy. For K185 and R201, we found that charge, more than any other property, controls the interaction of ATP with Kir6.2. At these positions, replacement with another positive residue had minor effects on ATP sensitivity. In contrast, replacement of K185 with a negative residue (K185D/E) decreased ATP sensitivity much more than neutral substitutions, suggesting that an electrostatic interaction between the beta phosphate group of ATP and K185 destabilizes the open state of the channel. At R201, replacement with a negative charge (R201E) had multiple effects, decreasing ATP sensitivity and preventing full channel closure at high concentrations. In contrast, the R50E mutation had a modest effect on ATP sensitivity, and only residues such as proline and glycine that affect protein structure caused major decreases in ATP sensitivity at the R50 position. Based on these results and the recently published structure of Kir3.1 cytoplasmic domain, we propose a scheme where binding of the beta phosphate group of ATP to K185 induces a motion of the surrounding region, which destabilizes the open state, favouring closure of the M2 gate. Binding of the alpha phosphate group of ATP to R201 then stabilizes the closed state. R50 on the N-terminus controls ATP binding by facilitating the interaction of the beta phosphate group of ATP with K185 to destabilize the open state.

12700220|t|Cross sectional survey of perpetrators, victims, and witnesses of violence in Bogota, Colombia.
12700220|a|OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence and distribution of witnesses, victims, and perpetrators of different types of violence in the general population and the proportion of victims consulting health services or reporting the incident to authorities. METHODS: Cross sectional survey of a random sample of 3007 inhabitants between the ages of 15 and 60 in the city of Bogota, Colombia, in 1997, based on a face to face interview. RESULTS: Age adjusted past year prevalence of witnesses, victims, and perpetrators of physical aggression was 61%, 27%, and 27%, respectively, while lifetime prevalence of witnesses, victims, and perpetrators of assault with a weapon in this population reached 70%, 55%, and 5.8%. Between 11% and 67% of the victims consulted a health service and less than 32% reported the incident to an authority. Those involved in most types of physical violence tended to be young, male, from lower middle social classes, with some degree of secondary education, and single or divorced. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of witnesses and victims of violence in this sample appears to be high, while perpetrators constitute a small proportion. Violence is not equally distributed throughout the population suggesting the possibility of identifying a population at higher risk for the development of intervention programmes.

18662104|t|Deterministic pharmacophore detection via multiple flexible alignment of drug-like molecules.
18662104|a|We present a novel highly efficient method for the detection of a pharmacophore from a set of drug-like ligands that interact with a target receptor. A pharmacophore is a spatial arrangement of physico-chemical features in a ligand that is essential for the interaction with a specific receptor. In the absence of a known three-dimensional (3D) receptor structure, a pharmacophore can be identified from a multiple structural alignment of ligand molecules. The key advantages of the presented algorithm are: (a) its ability to multiply align flexible ligands in a deterministic manner, (b) its ability to focus on subsets of the input ligands, which may share a large common substructure, resulting in the detection of both outlier molecules and alternative binding modes, and (c) its computational efficiency, which allows to detect pharmacophores shared by a large number of molecules on a standard PC. The algorithm was extensively tested on a dataset of almost 80 ligands acting on 12 different receptors. The results, which were achieved using a set of standard default parameters, were consistent with reference pharmacophores that were derived from the bound ligand-receptor complexes. The pharmacophores detected by the algorithm are expected to be a key component in the discovery of new leads by screening large databases of drug-like molecules.

16966611|t|Progesterone blocks estrogen-induced DNA synthesis through the inhibition of replication licensing.
16966611|a|In the uterus, progesterone (P4) acts early in G1 as a physiological inhibitor of estradiol-17beta (E2)-induced epithelial cell proliferation. Gene expression profiling of uterine epithelial cell RNA isolated 3 h after hormonal treatment of ovariectomized mice revealed the co-coordinate down-regulation by P4 of >20 genes whose functions are associated with DNA replication. This group included all of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins that are required for DNA replication licensing. E2 regulated loading of these MCM proteins onto chromatin in parallel with its induction of DNA synthesis. E2 caused this chromatin loading by retention of MCM proteins in the nucleus and through the induction of the loading factor Cdt1, which is necessary for the MCM heterohexamer to bind to the origin of DNA replication. P4 dramatically reduced the binding of the MCMs to chromatin by a number of mechanisms. First, MCM mRNA and protein abundance was down-regulated. Second, P4 inhibited the E2 induction of Cdt1. Third, P4 treatment sequestered the normally nuclear MCM proteins into the cytoplasm. This reduced MCM binding resulted in the complete inhibition of E2-induced DNA synthesis by P4. These data reveal mechanisms not only for female sex steroid hormone action but also in the regulation of DNA replication licensing.

2536156|t|Positive genetic selection for gene disruption in mammalian cells by homologous recombination.
2536156|a|Efficient modification of genes in mammalian cells by homologous recombination has not been possible because of the high frequency of nonhomologous recombination. An efficient method for targeted gene disruption has been developed. Cells with substitution of exogenous sequences into a chromosomal locus were enriched, by a factor of 100, using a positive genetic selection that specifically selects for homologous recombination at the targeted site. The selection is based on the conditional expression of a dominant selectable marker by virtue of in-frame gene fusion with the target gene. The dominant selectable marker was derived by modification of the Escherichia coli neo gene so that it retains significant activity in mammalian cells after in-frame fusion with heterologous coding sequences. In the example presented here, homologous recombinants were efficiently recovered from a pool in which the targeted gene was disrupted in 1 per 10,000 cells incorporating exogenous DNA.

8984023|t|Developmental differences in the expression of the cholera toxin sensitive subunit (Gs alpha) of adenylate cyclase in the rat small intestine.
8984023|a|BACKGROUND: The stimulatory guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein alpha subunit (Gs alpha) of adenylate cyclase is the target protein for cholera toxin. AIMS/METHODS: The expression of this signal transducer was analysed in the small intestine of developing rats by RNA transfer (northern blot) analysis by immunoblotting, and by ADP-ribosylation of membrane proteins. RESULTS: Intestinal Gs alpha mRNA (about 1.9 kb) was increased in the neonate compared with the adult rat. Two isoforms of Gs alpha proteins, a 45,000 and a 52,000 form, were expressed in the small intestinal epithelial cell and both were ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin. A significant increase in the larger isoform (52,000) and in its ribosylation was noted in the 2 week old suckling compared with post-weaned older animals. The protein content or ribosylation of the smaller form (45,000) did not significantly change with age. CONCLUSION: These data show that a developmental decline of intestinal Gs alpha expression seems to be, in part, regulated at the mRNA level. An increased Gs alpha expression in the immature intestine may help to explain a previously reported, dose dependent increased adenylate cyclase response and an increase in fluid secretion to cholera toxin in neonates compared with adults.

10734192|t|A further investigation and reappraisal of the thio effect in the cleavage reaction catalyzed by a hammerhead ribozyme.
10734192|a|We synthesized three types of 11mer substrate, namely the natural substrate S11O and the thio-substituted substrates S11 S pS and S11 R pS, in which the respective pro-S p and pro-R p oxygen atoms were replaced by sulfur, and subjected them to detailed kinetic analysis in the cleavage reaction catalyzed by a hammerhead ribozyme. In agreement with previous findings, in the presence of Mg(2+)or Ca(2+)ions the rate of ribozyme-catalyzed cleavage of S11 S pS was as high as that of S11O, whereas the corresponding rate for S11 R pS was nearly four orders of magnitude lower than that for either S11O or S11 S pS. However, the rate of the ribozyme-catalyzed reaction with each of the three substrates was enhanced by Cd(2+)ions. Such results have generally been taken as evidence that supports the direct interaction of the sulfur atom at the R p position of the cleavage site with the added Cd(2+)ion. However, our present analysis demonstrates that (i) the added Cd(2+)ion binds at the P9 site; (ii) the bound Cd(2+)ion at the P9 site replaces two Mg(2+)or two Ca(2+)ions, an observation that suggests a different mode of interaction with the added Cd(2+)ion; and, most importantly and in contrast to the conclusion reached by other investigators, (iii) the Cd(2+)ion does not interact with the sulfur atom at the R p position of the scissile phosphate either in the ground state or in the transition state.

9096313|t|Sodium salicylate induces apoptosis via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase but inhibits tumor necrosis factor-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase activation.
9096313|a|In a previous study, we demonstrated that sodium salicylate (NaSal) selectively inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of the p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases). Here we show that in normal human FS-4 fibroblasts NaSal inhibits TNF-induced activation of another member of the MAPK family, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase. c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation induced by interleukin 1 or epidermal growth factor was less strongly inhibited by NaSal. Unexpectedly, treatment of FS-4 cells with NaSal alone produced a strong activation of p38 MAPK and cell death by apoptosis. NaSal-induced apoptosis was blocked by the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-203580, indicating that p38 MAPK serves as a mediator of NaSal-induced apoptosis in human fibroblasts. Activation of p38 MAPK and the resulting induction of apoptosis may be important in the demonstrated antineoplastic actions of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

19043818|a|This study is to investigate the long-term effects of nanodimension PEG-PLA artificial red blood cells containing hemoglobin and red blood cell enzymes on the liver and spleen after 1/3 blood volume top loading in rats. The experimental rats received one of the following infusions: Nano artificial red blood cells in Ringer lactate, Ringer lactate, stroma-free hemoglobin, polyhemoglobin, and autologous rat whole blood. Blood samples were taken before infusions and on days 1, 7, and 21 after infusions for analysis. Nano artificial red blood cells, polyhemoglobin, Ringer lactate and rat red blood cells did not have any significant adverse effects on alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, amylase and creatine kinase. On the other hand, stroma-free hemoglobin induced significant adverse effects on liver as shown by elevation in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase throughout the 21 days. On day 21 after infusions rats were sacrificed and livers and spleens were excised for histological examination. Nano artificial red blood cells, polyhemoglobin, Ringer lactate and rat red blood cells did not cause any abnormalities in the microscopic histology of the livers and spleens. In the stroma-free hemoglobin group the livers showed accumulation of hemoglobin in central veins and sinusoids, and hepatic steatosis. In conclusion, injected nano artificial red blood cells can be efficiently metabolized and removed by the reticuloendothelial system, and do not have any biochemical or histological adverse effects on the livers or the spleens.

11238932|t|The winged-helix protein brain factor 1 interacts with groucho and hes proteins to repress transcription.
11238932|a|Brain factor 1 (BF-1) is a winged-helix transcriptional repressor that plays important roles in both progenitor cell differentiation and regional patterning in the mammalian telencephalon. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying BF-1 functions. It is shown here that BF-1 interacts in vivo with global transcriptional corepressors of the Groucho family and also associates with the histone deacetylase 1 protein. The ability of BF-1 to mediate transcriptional repression is promoted by Groucho and inhibited by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, suggesting that BF-1 recruits Groucho and histone deacetylase activities to repress transcription. Our studies also provide the first demonstration that Groucho mediates a specific interaction between BF-1 and the basic helix-loop-helix protein Hes1 and that BF-1 potentiates transcriptional repression by Hes1 in a Groucho-dependent manner. These findings suggest that Groucho participates in the transcriptional functions of BF-1 by acting as both a corepressor and an adapter between BF-1 and Hes1. Taken together with the demonstration that these proteins are coexpressed in telencephalic neural progenitor cells, these results also suggest that complexes of BF-1, Groucho, and Hes factors may be involved in the regulation of progenitor cell differentiation in the telencephalon.

9576970|t|Chlorophyll a availability affects psbA translation and D1 precursor processing in vivo in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
9576970|a|Transcript accumulation and translation of psbA as well as processing of the D1 precursor protein were investigated in relation to chlorophyll availability in vivo in cyanobacterial strains lacking photosystem I (PS I). The psbA transcript level was almost independent of chlorophyll availability and was approximately 3-fold lower in darkness than in continuous light (5 microE m-2 s-1). Upon illumination, it reached a steady-state level within several hours. Upon growth under light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions (LAHG) in the PS I-less strain, D1 synthesis occurred immediately upon illumination. However, in PS I-less/chlL- cells, which lacked the light-independent chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and had very low chlorophyll levels after LAHG growth, very little D1 synthesis occurred upon illumination, and the synthesis rate increased with time. This result suggests a translational control of D1 biosynthesis related to chlorophyll availability. Upon illumination, initially a high level of the nonprocessed D1 precursor was observed by pulse labeling and immunodetection in LAHG-grown PS I-less/chlL- cells but not in PS I-less cells. A significant amount of the D1 precursor eventually was processed to mature D1, and the half-life of the D1 precursor decreased as the chlorophyll content of the cells increased. The D1 processing enzyme CtpA was found to be present at similar levels regardless illumination or chlorophyll levels. We conclude that, directly or indirectly, chlorophyll availability is needed for D1 translation as well as for efficient processing of the D1 precursor.

6941302|t|Evolution of the mutation rate at a heterotic locus.
6941302|a|A diffusion model of the modification of mutation rates at a heterotic locus in a finite population is examined. An asymptotic analysis assuming strong selection and weak linkage shows that selection can operate on mutation rates in this setting. There exists a favored mutation rate which is a function only of the equilibrium allele frequency of the heterotic locus and the population size. It is independent of the strength of selection at the heterotoxic locus. Computer simulations are also provided to show that this form of natural selection can occur.

307535|a|Pneumocystis carinii derived from infected murine lung was found to be capable of limited growth in Vero African green monkey kidney cell cultures. The observed increase in the number of cyst forms was influenced by the ratio of cysts to host cells in the inocula, duration of passage, and formulation of the cell culture media. Maximum growth was achieved by inoculating 1.3 X 10(5) cysts per 75-cm2 flask containing about 2 X 10(7) Vero cells (cyst-to-cell ratio=1:154) maintained on minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. Under these conditions of culture, a 10.8-fold increase in cyst forms was observed during a 7-day passage in cell culture utilizing cyst-to-cell ratios ranging from 1:28 to 1:2,778.

19290923|t|Tec kinases regulate T-lymphocyte development and function: new insights into the roles of Itk and Rlk/Txk.
19290923|a|The Tec (tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma) family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases consists of five members: Tec, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), inducible T-cell kinase (Itk), resting lymphocyte kinase (Rlk/Txk), and bone marrow-expressed kinase (Bmx/Etk). Although their functions are probably best understood in antigen receptor signaling, where they participate in the phosphorylation and regulation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma), it is now appreciated that these kinases contribute to signaling from many receptors and that they participate in multiple downstream pathways, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. In T cells, three Tec kinases are expressed, Itk, Rlk/Txk, and Tec. Itk is expressed at highest amounts and plays the major role in regulating signaling from the T-cell receptor. Recent studies provide evidence that these kinases contribute to multiple aspects of T-cell biology and have unique roles in T-cell development that have revealed new insight into the regulation of conventional and innate T-cell development. We review new findings on the Tec kinases with a focus on their roles in T-cell development and mature T-cell differentiation.

3618728|t|Directed targeting of immunoerythrocytes provides local protection of endothelial cells from damage by hydrogen peroxide.
3618728|a|Red blood cells bearing anti-mouse IgG antibody on their surface (immunoerythrocytes) may provide for local protection of endothelial cells from the action of hydrogen peroxide. Subconfluent cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells responded sharply to increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Permeabilization of cellular membrane occurred at doses of hydrogen peroxide of from 1 to 3 mM, and was assured by incorporation of trypan blue stain immediately after treatment. Latent damage of cells produced by much lower doses of hydrogen peroxide (0.2-0.4 mM) could be observed after 24-hour incubation of treated cells in the normal culture medium with no hydrogen peroxide. The apparently dead cells differed from intact cells in morphology, were poorly attached to the substrate, and were readily incorporated by trypan blue, thus permitting easy visualization. Immunoerythrocytes bound to the antigen-coated surface enzymatically decreased the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in their microenvironment at least fivefold with respect to the total hydrogen peroxide concentration. Erythrocytes deposited on a part of the endothelial monolayer locally protected it from the damage at hydrogen peroxide concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 mM. Localization of protected zones corresponded precisely to the geometry of the erythrocyte coating. Immunoerythrocytes targeted to the endothelial cells by means of mouse anti-endothelial antiserum did not impair their viability and protected the endothelium from being killed at 0.3-1.2 mM hydrogen peroxide. This approach might be useful for a cell selection in mixed cell populations. The problem of local protection of cells involved in the inflammation focus are discussed.

202958|t|Stimulation of sugar uptake and thymidine incorporation in mouse 3T3 cells by calcium phosphate and other extracellular particles.
202958|a|Evidence is presented that the marked stimulation of sugar uptake and thymidine incorporation by addition of extra Ca2+ to stationary phase mouse 3T3 cells in culture is phosphate dependent and due to the action of the calcium phosphate precipitate formed in the medium. The cells are similarly stimulated by a variety of particulate materials, including calcium pyrophosphate, barium sulfate, kaolin, and polystrene beads. The precipitate effects on sugar uptake are of the same magnitude as those seen with certain hormones (insulin, epidermal growth factor) or with fresh 10% calf serum. The effect of barium sulfate on thymidine incorporation is also of the same magnitude as seen with these hormones, but much less than half that found with fresh calf serum. The stimulation by barium sulfate or hormones of thymidine incorporation is not phosphate dependent.

This is a valuable, scientific foundation-that uses the highest relevant standard of evidence-for the role of law as a public health tool.

1940791|t|COOH terminus of membrane IgM is essential for an antigen-specific induction of some but not all early activation events in mature B cells.
1940791|a|Transfectants of mature B cell lines that bind phosphorylcholine were made in order to understand the role of the COOH terminus of the mu chain of membrane IgM (mIgM) in generation of antigen-specific signals. A chimeric receptor (I-A alpha tail) was constructed by replacing 40 amino acids from the mu COOH terminus with that of major histocompatibility complex class II I-A alpha chain. The effect of wild-type and chimeric tails were studied on representative immediate-early antigen-specific signals. The I-A alpha tail hybrid, but not the wild-type receptor, was defective in antigen-driven Ca2+ mobilization, although it could effectively endocytose ligand-receptor complexes. Signal(s) transduced through the wild-type receptor led to transient induction of selected immediate-early gene messages (Egr-1, c-fos, Jun) above basal levels. However, the signal(s) generated after crosslinking of the I-A alpha tail receptor either showed no effect (c-fos) or actually repressed basal level expression of Egr-1 and Jun. Thus, we have established that receptor-mediated endocytosis can be distinguished from other early events associated with B cell activation, based on their differential dependence upon the structural fidelity of the COOH-terminal sequence of mIgM.

6745722|t|Is raised breath hydrogen related to the pathogenesis of pneumatosis coli?
6745722|a|Clinical and physiological studies were carried out in five patients with pneumatosis coli in order to investigate the origin of the high fasting breath hydrogen concentration in this condition and to determine its possible significance in the pathogenesis of the disease. All five patients excreted abnormally high fasting concentrations of hydrogen in their breath (69 +/- 9 ppm, mean +/- SEM). Moreover, analysis of the contents of the gas filled cysts revealed between 2% and 8% of hydrogen gas. Colonic washout significantly reduced breath hydrogen concentrations to 9 +/- 6 ppm, but did not abolish the cysts. Conversely, deflation of the cysts was achieved with oxygen or antibiotics, though this only reduced breath hydrogen concentrations to about 66% of their original value. After feeding a radiolabelled meal, breath hydrogen concentrations rose before the meal appeared to reach the colon, suggesting overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine. Despite this, 14C glycocholate breath tests were within normal limits. An alternative possibility is that the high levels of hydrogen excreted in the breath may be produced in the intestinal lumen possibly from the fermentation of copious amounts of colonic mucus. Finally, measurement of whole gut transit time and stool weight suggested that patients were constipated despite passing mucus and blood. The relevance of our observations to the pathogenesis of submucosal cysts is unclear, but the data favour the hypothesis that these are produced by invasion of the colonic submucosa with anaerobic bacteria.

6329674|t|Paraquat: model for oxidant-initiated toxicity.
6329674|a|Paraquat, a quaternary ammonium bipyridyl herbicide, produces degenerative lesions in the lung after systemic administration to man and animals. The pulmonary toxicity of paraquat resembles in several ways the toxicity of several other lung toxins, including oxygen, nitrofurantoin and bleomycin. Although a definitive mechanism of toxicity of paraquat has not been delineated, a cyclic single electron reduction/oxidation of the parent molecule is a critical mechanistic event. The redox cycling of paraquat has two potentially important consequences relevant to the development of toxicity: generation of "activated oxygen" (e.g., superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical) which is highly reactive to cellular macromolecules; and/or oxidation of reducing equivalents (e.g., NADPH, reduced glutathione) necessary for normal cell function. Paraquat-induced pulmonary toxicity, therefore, is a potentially useful model for evaluation of oxidant mechanisms of toxicity. Furthermore, characterization of the consequences of intracellular redox cycling of xenobiotics will no doubt provide basic information regarding the role of this phenomena in the development of chemical toxicity.

In men history of slimming treatment was significantly associated (p less than 0.05) with gall stones in univariate and in multivariate analyses, where smoking also became significantly associated (p less than 0.05).

3012555|t|Inhibition of replication and expression of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III in cultured cells by exogenous synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to viral RNA.
3012555|a|The possibility of using oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to viral RNA or proviral DNA to inhibit the replication of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) [the etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)] in cultured human cells was addressed by studying the association of 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides with mammalian cellular components. The results indicated that exogenous oligodeoxynucleotides at 20 microM became associated with the membrane/cytosol fractions of the cell in amounts approximating 1.5 microM. Oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to a region close to the tRNALys primer binding site on HTLV-III RNA and others complementary to HTLV-III mRNA donor or acceptor splice sites inhibited viral replication (assayed as reverse transcriptase) and gene expression (assayed as virus-encoded proteins p15 and p24) by as much as 95%. Use of control (random) oligodeoxynucleotides suggests that the antiviral effects were specific. Although these results pertain to HTLV-III-infected cells in tissue culture, rather than to AIDS patients, they nevertheless point to a therapeutic potential of the complementary oligodeoxynucleotide ("hybridization competition" or "hybridon") approach in the treatment of patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.

19047519|t|Newly introduced genomic prophage islands are critical determinants of in vivo competitiveness in the Liverpool Epidemic Strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
19047519|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates have a highly conserved core genome representing up to 90% of the total genomic sequence with additional variable accessory genes, many of which are found in genomic islands or islets. The identification of the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES) in a children's cystic fibrosis (CF) unit in 1996 and its subsequent observation in several centers in the United Kingdom challenged the previous widespread assumption that CF patients acquire only unique strains of P. aeruginosa from the environment. To learn about the forces that shaped the development of this important epidemic strain, the genome of the earliest archived LES isolate, LESB58, was sequenced. The sequence revealed the presence of many large genomic islands, including five prophage clusters, one defective (pyocin) prophage cluster, and five non-phage islands. To determine the role of these clusters, an unbiased signature tagged mutagenesis study was performed, followed by selection in the chronic rat lung infection model. Forty-seven mutants were identified by sequencing, including mutants in several genes known to be involved in Pseudomonas infection. Furthermore, genes from four prophage clusters and one genomic island were identified and in direct competition studies with the parent isolate; four were demonstrated to strongly impact on competitiveness in the chronic rat lung infection model. This strongly indicates that enhanced in vivo competitiveness is a major driver for maintenance and diversifying selection of these genomic prophage genes.

11563974|t|RGS18 is a myeloerythroid lineage-specific regulator of G-protein-signalling molecule highly expressed in megakaryocytes.
11563974|a|Myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis are controlled by haematopoietic growth factors, including cytokines, and chemokines that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Regulators of G-protein signalling (RGSs) are a protein family that can act as GTPase-activating proteins for G(alphai)- and G(alphaq)-class proteins. We have identified a new member of the R4 subfamily of RGS proteins, RGS18. RGS18 contains clusters of hydrophobic and basic residues, which are characteristic of an amphipathic helix within its first 33 amino acids. RGS18 mRNA was most highly abundant in megakaryocytes, and was also detected specifically in haematopoietic progenitor and myeloerythroid lineage cells. RGS18 mRNA was not detected in cells of the lymphoid lineage. RGS18 was also highly expressed in mouse embryonic 15-day livers, livers being the principal organ for haematopoiesis at this stage of fetal development. RGS1, RGS2 and RGS16, other members of the R4 subfamily, were expressed in distinct progenitor and mature myeloerythroid and lymphoid lineage blood cells. RGS18 was shown to interact specifically with the G(alphai-3) subunit in membranes from K562 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of RGS18 inhibited mitogen-activated-protein kinase activation in HEK-293/chemokine receptor 2 cells treated with monocyte chemotactic protein-1. In yeast cells, RGS18 overexpression complemented a pheromone-sensitive phenotype caused by mutations in the endogeneous yeast RGS gene, SST2. These data demonstrated that RGS18 was expressed most highly in megakaryocytes, and can modulate GPCR pathways in both mammalian and yeast cells in vitro. Hence RGS18 might have an important role in the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation and chemotaxis.

12885878|t|External TEA block of shaker K+ channels is coupled to the movement of K+ ions within the selectivity filter.
12885878|a|Recent molecular dynamic simulations and electrostatic calculations suggested that the external TEA binding site in K+ channels is outside the membrane electric field. However, it has been known for some time that external TEA block of Shaker K+ channels is voltage dependent. To reconcile these two results, we reexamined the voltage dependence of block of Shaker K+ channels by external TEA. We found that the voltage dependence of TEA block all but disappeared in solutions in which K+ ions were replaced by Rb+. These and other results with various concentrations of internal K+ and Rb+ ions suggest that the external TEA binding site is not within the membrane electric field and that the voltage dependence of TEA block in K+ solutions arises through a coupling with the movement of K+ ions through part of the membrane electric field. Our results suggest that external TEA block is coupled to two opposing voltage-dependent movements of K+ ions in the pore: (a) an inward shift of the average position of ions in the selectivity filter equivalent to a single ion moving approximately 37% into the pore from the external surface; and (b) a movement of internal K+ ions into a vestibule binding site located approximately 13% into the membrane electric field measured from the internal surface. The minimal voltage dependence of external TEA block in Rb+ solutions results from a minimal occupancy of the vestibule site by Rb+ ions and because the energy profile of the selectivity filter favors a more inward distribution of Rb+ occupancy.

3893528|a|Data for the first 12 months are reported for an ongoing, multicentre, clinical study comparing the long-term, ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of topical levobunolol (0.5% and 1%) and timolol (0.5%). This study was a double-masked trial testing 88 patients with chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. During the 12-month period drops were instilled twice daily into both eyes after a washout of prestudy ocular hypotensive medication. The effect of the three treatments in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) was similar. Mean IOP reductions over the 12 months averaged 7.2 mmHg for the 0.5% levobunolol group, 6.2 mmHg for the 1% levobunolol group, and 6.0 mmHg for the timolol group. Decreases in mean heart rate of up to 5 beats per minute were observed in the 0.5% levobunolol group, up to 8 beats per minute in the 1% levobunolol group, and up to 4 beats per minute in the timolol group. Several patients were removed from the study owing to side effects possibly related to levobunolol treatment.

16614524|t|Therapeutic factors of cognitive behavioral group treatment for social phobia.
16614524|a|This study investigated the therapeutic factors influencing the outcome of cognitive behavioral group treatment for social phobia and the most helpful therapeutic component. Fifty psychiatric outpatients who were diagnosed with social phobia according to the DSM-IV criteria were chosen as subjects. Patients were asked to complete the Yalom's Curative Factors Questionnaire and Therapeutic Components Evaluation Form at the end of their Cognitive Behavioral Group Treatment (CBGT). The patients who showed more improvement rated significantly higher in therapeutic factors such as "Interpersonal learning-output", "Guidance", "Universality", "Group cohesiveness" than the patients who showed less improvement. Among the four components of CBGT for social phobia, cognitive restructuring was rated as most helpful. These results suggest which therapeutic factors and components should be highlighted in CBGT for social phobia.

3470810|t|Evoked release of acetylcholine from the growing embryonic neuron.
3470810|a|An excised patch of embryonic muscle membrane was used as a probe for measuring the release of acetylcholine (AcCho) from growing spinal neurons in Xenopus cell culture. The neuron was stimulated extracellularly at the soma, and the evoked AcCho release was monitored at the growth cone, along the neurite, and near the soma. For a majority of the neurons studied, a brief suprathreshold stimulation of the soma triggered a pulse of AcCho release from the growth cone. This release showed many of the characteristics reminiscent of the transmitter release at the nerve terminal of a mature neuromuscular synapse: it occurs within a few ms following the stimulation, depends on extracellular Ca2+ concentration, and exhibits depression and potentiation during and after high-frequency stimulation, respectively. Similar evoked release was also observed only at selected points along the neurite, and prolonged suprathreshold stimulus was required to induce release from the soma. These results indicate that some of the growing spinal neurons have acquired a substantial number of AcCho molecules as well as an efficient mechanism for excitation-secretion coupling at the growth cone, ready for establishing functional contact with the target muscle cell. This notion was further supported by the finding that the evoked AcCho release is capable of inducing suprathreshold excitation of the muscle cell within the first minute following neurite-muscle contact.

16549411|t|A diagnostic formulation for anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease.
16549411|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the earliest symptoms of anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease and to validate a criteria-guided strategy to diagnose anosognosia in dementia. METHODS: A consecutive series of 750 patients with very mild or probable Alzheimer's disease attending a memory clinic, as well as their respective care givers, was assessed using a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation. RESULTS: The factors of anosognosia for (1) basic activities of daily living (bADL), (2) instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), (3) depression and (4) disinhibition were produced by a principal component analysis on the differential scores (ie, caregiver score minus patient score) on the anosognosia questionnaire for dementia. A discrepancy of two or more points in the anosognosia-iADL factor was found to have a high sensitivity and specificity to identify clinically diagnosed anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease. By logistic regression analysis, the severity of dementia and apathy were both shown to be noticeably associated with anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: Anosognosia in those with Alzheimer's disease is manifested as poor awareness of deficits in iADL and bADL, depressive changes and behavioural disinhibition. The frequency of anosognosia is found to increase considerably with the severity of dementia. The validity of a specific set of criteria to diagnose anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease was shown, which may contribute to the early identification of this condition.

15197108|t|Stimulus-specific defect in the phagocytic pathways of annexin 1 null macrophages.
15197108|a|The role of the glucocorticoid-regulated protein annexin 1 during the process of phagocytosis has been studied using annexin 1 null peritoneal macrophages. Wild type and annexin 1 null macrophages were incubated with several distinct phagocytic targets. No differences were observed in rate or the maximal response with respect to IgG complexes or opsonised zymosan phagocytosis, as assessed by monitoring the production of reactive oxygen species. When annexin 1 null macrophages were incubated with non-opsonised zymosan particles, they exhibited impaired generation of reactive oxygen species, which was linked to a defect in binding of cells to the particles, as determined with fluorescent zymosan. This phenomenon was further confirmed by electron microscopy analysis, where annexin 1 null macrophages internalised fewer non-opsonised zymosan particles. Specific alterations in macrophage plasma membrane markers were observed in the annexin 1 null cells. Whereas no differences in dectin-1 and FcgammaR II/III expression were measured between the two genotypes, decreased membrane CD11b and F4/80 levels were measured selectively in macrophages lacking annexin 1. These cells also responded with an enhanced release of PGE(2) and COX-2 protein expression following addition of the soluble stimulants, LPS and heat-activated IgG. In conclusion, these results suggest that participation of endogenous annexin 1 during zymosan phagocytosis is critical and that this protein plays a tonic inhibitory role during macrophage activation.

8741736|t|Characterization of oxalate transport by the human erythrocyte band 3 protein.
8741736|a|This paper describes characteristics of the transport of oxalate across the human erythrocyte membrane. Treatment of cells with low concentrations of H2DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate) inhibits Cl(-)-Cl- and oxalate-oxalate exchange to the same extent, suggesting that band 3 is the major transport pathway for oxalate. The kinetics of oxalate and Cl- self-exchange fluxes indicate that the two ions compete for a common transport site; the apparent Cl- affinity is two to three times higher than that of oxalate. The net exchange of oxalate for Cl-, in either direction, is accompanied by a flux of H+ with oxalate, as is also true of net Cl(-)-SO4(2-) exchange. The transport of oxalate, however, is much faster than that of SO4(2-) or other divalent anions. Oxalate influx into Cl(-)-containing cells has an extracellular pH optimum of approximately 5.5 at 0 degrees C. At extracellular pH below 5.5 (neutral intracellular pH), net Cl(-)-oxalate exchange is nearly as fast as Cl(-)-Cl- exchange. The rapid Cl(-)-oxalate exchange at acid extracellular pH is not likely to be a consequence of Cl- exchange for monovalent oxalate (HOOC-COO-; pKa = 4.2) because monocarboxylates of similar structure exchange for Cl- much more slowly than does oxalate. The activation energy of Cl(-)-oxalate exchange is about 35 kCal/mol at temperatures between 0 and 15 degrees C; the rapid oxalate influx is therefore not a consequence of a low activation energy. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid has no detectable effect on oxalate self-exchange, in contrast to a recent finding in another laboratory (Baggio, B., L. Bordin, G. Clari, G. Gambaro, and V. Moret. 1993. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1148:157-160.); our data provide no evidence for physiological regulation of anion exchange in red cells.

16203839|t|Pediatric window falls: not just a problem for children in high rises.
16203839|a|BACKGROUND: Window falls are a frequent cause of injury (15/100,000) among Chicago preschool children. In Boston and New York, public health efforts have successfully decreased window fall injuries. Local data are needed to develop appropriate interventions for Chicago. OBJECTIVE: To describe the housing characteristics and types of injuries among children who fell from windows treated in a Chicago pediatric trauma center. METHODS: Children treated in a pediatric trauma center for injuries related to window falls between 1995 and 2002 were identified retrospectively. We reviewed family demographics, the circumstances of the fall, and types of injuries. Site visits were performed to determine the height and type of building and type of window where the fall took place. RESULTS: The authors reviewed 90 cases; 55 were male. The median age was 2 years. Ninety eight percent of falls were reported to be from the third floor or lower. Site visits (n=77) showed that 96% of the buildings were four storeys or lower. The median length of hospital stay was two days (range 0--24 days). The most common injuries were head trauma and extremity fractures. Three patients died, and an additional three patients were discharged to rehabilitation centers. CONCLUSIONS: Some window falls result in serious injury. In Chicago, most falls were from modest heights (2nd/3rd floor windows) in buildings of four or fewer storeys, rather than from "high rises". Strategies to prevent window falls should be directed to the owners and occupants of this type of housing.

16227543|t|Acute small subcortical infarctions on diffusion weighted MRI: clinical presentation and aetiology.
16227543|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical presentation and aetiology of small subcortical infarctions as found on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). DWI is both sensitive and specific in the early detection of acute ischaemic brain lesions irrespective of pre-existing vascular damage. METHODS: Ninety three patients were identified showing subcortical or brainstem DWI lesions <1.5 cm in diameter within a maximum of 7 days from the onset of stroke symptoms. The patients' clinical status on admission was reviewed according to the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP). The results of procedures searching for cerebrovascular risk factors, large artery disease, and potential sources of cardiac embolism were included to determine stroke aetiology. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were also reviewed for concomitant changes that could support the aetiologic classification. RESULTS: Only 41 (44.1%) patients presented clinically with a lacunar syndrome according to OCSP criteria. The nine (9.7%) patients who showed two or more DWI lesions in different vascular territories were also significantly more likely to have potential sources of cardiac embolism (5/9, 55.6% v 20/84, 23.8%). Hypertension was significantly more prevalent in the group of patients who showed a microangiopathy related imaging pattern, but this pattern did not exclude the presence of large artery disease or a possible cardioembolic source of stroke. CONCLUSION: Identification of small subcortical infarctions as the cause of stroke appears quite uncertain based on clinical characteristics only. DWI adds significant aetiologic information but does not obviate the search for other potentially causative mechanisms.

17012216|t|How golden is silence? Teaching undergraduates the power and limits of RNA interference.
17012216|a|It is hard and getting harder to strike a satisfying balance in teaching. Time dedicated to student-generated models or ideas is often sacrificed in an effort to "get through the syllabus." I describe a series of RNA interference (RNAi) experiments for undergraduate students that simultaneously explores fundamental concepts in gene regulation, develops cutting-edge laboratory skills, and embraces student-directed learning. Students design a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against luciferase, add it to cells expressing this gene, and then quantitatively assess the siRNA's effect on both intended and unintended targets, using a luciferase assay and a DNA microarray. Because both RNAi and microarray technologies are relatively new, with no clear consensus on their analysis or limitations, students are encouraged to explore different approaches to the design of their reagents and interpretations of their data. The ability to creatively formulate a hypothesis-driven experimental approach to a scientific question and to critically evaluate collected data is stressed. Equally important, this experiment emphasizes how modern scientific ideas emerge, are debated, tested, and decided.
