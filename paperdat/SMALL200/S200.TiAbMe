15545608|t|Medicinal chemistry applied to a synthetic protein: development of highly potent HIV entry inhibitors.
15545608|a|We have used total chemical synthesis to perform high-resolution dissection of the pharmacophore of a potent anti-HIV protein, the aminooxypentane oxime of [glyoxylyl1]RANTES(2-68), known as AOP-RANTES, of which we designed and made 37 analogs. All involved incorporation of one or more rationally chosen nonnatural noncoded structures, for which we found a clear comparative advantage over coded ones. We investigated structure-activity relationships in the pharmacophore by screening the analogs for their ability to block the HIV entry process and produced a derivative, PSC-RANTES [N-nonanoyl, des-Ser1[L-thioproline2, L-cyclohexylglycine3]-RANTES(2-68)], which is 50 times more potent than AOP-RANTES. This promising group of compounds might be optimized yet further as potential prophylactic and therapeutic anti-HIV agents. The remarkable potency of our RANTES analogs probably involves the unusual mechanism of intracellular sequestration of CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), and it has been suggested that this arises from enhanced affinity for the receptor. We found that inhibitory potency and capacity to induce CCR5 down-modulation do appear to be correlated, but that unexpectedly, inhibitory potency and affinity for CCR5 do not. We believe this study represents the proof of principle for the use of a medicinal chemistry approach, above all one showing the advantage of noncoded structures, to the optimization of the pharmacological properties of a protein. Medicinal chemistry of small molecules is the foundation of modern pharmaceutical practice, and we believe we have shown that techniques have now reached the point at which the approach could also be applied to the many macromolecular drugs now in common use.

18510977|t|Gene silencing in phlebotomine sand flies: Xanthine dehydrogenase knock down by dsRNA microinjections.
18510977|a|Lutzomyia longipalpis are vectors of medically important visceral leishmaniasis in South America. Blood-fed adult females digest large amounts of protein, and xanthine dehydrogenase is thought to be a key enzyme involved in protein catabolism through the production of urate. Large amounts of heme are also released during digestion with potentially damaging consequences, as heme can generate oxygen radicals that damage lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. However, urate is an antioxidant that may prevent such oxidative damage produced by heme. We investigated xanthine dehydrogenase by developing the RNAi technique for sand flies and used this technique to knock down the Lu. longipalpis xanthine dehydrogenase gene to evaluate its role in survival of adult females after blood feeding. The gene sequence of Lu. longipalpis xanthine dehydrogenase is described together with expression in different life cycle stages and RNAi knock down. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR of xanthine dehydrogenase expression showed a significant increase in expression after bloodmeal ingestion. Microinjection of dsRNA via the thorax of 1-day-old adult female sand flies resulted in approximately 40% reduction of xanthine dehydrogenase gene expression in comparison to flies injected with a control dsRNA. A significant reduction of urate in the whole body and excretions of Lu. longipalpis was observed after dsRNA xanthine dehydrogenase microinjection and feeding 96h later on rabbit blood. Sand flies injected with XDH dsRNA also exhibit significantly reduced life span in comparison with the mock-injected group when fed on sucrose or when rabbit blood fed, showing that urate could be indeed an important free radical scavenger in Lu. longipalpis. The demonstration of xanthine dehydrogenase knock down by dsRNA microinjection, low mortality of microinjected insects and the successful bloodfeeding of injected insects demonstrated the utility of RNAi as a tool for functional analysis of genes in phlebotomine sand flies.

15880522|t|Pontine-wave generator activation-dependent memory processing of avoidance learning involves the dorsal hippocampus in the rat.
15880522|a|The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the dorsal hippocampus plays a critical role in pontine-wave (P-wave) generator activation-dependent memory processing of two-way active avoidance (TWAA) learning. To achieve this objective, rats were given small bilateral lesions in the CA1, dentate gyrus (DG), or CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus by microinjecting ibotenic acid. After recovery, lesioned and sham-lesioned rats were trained on a TWAA learning paradigm, allowed a 6-hr period of undisturbed sleep, and then were tested on the same TWAA paradigm. It was found that lesions in the CA3 region impaired retention of avoidance learning. Conversely, lesions in the CA1 and DG regions had no effect on TWAA learning retention. None of the groups showed any changes in the baseline sleep-wake cycle or in the acquisition of TWAA learning. All rats showed increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increased REM sleep P-wave density during the subsequent 6-hr recording period. Impaired retention in the CA3 group occurred despite an increase in REM sleep and P-wave density, suggesting that during REM sleep, the P-wave generator interacts with the CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus to aid in consolidation of TWAA learning. The results of the present study thus demonstrate that P-wave generator activation-dependent consolidation of memory requires an intact CA3 subfield of the dorsal hippocampus. The results also provide evidence that under mnemonic pressure, the dorsal hippocampus may not be involved directly in regulating the sleep-wake cycle.

17400790|t|Autism, language delay and mental retardation in a patient with 7q11 duplication.
17400790|a|BACKGROUND: Chromosomal rearrangements, arising from unequal recombination between repeated sequences, are found in a subset of patients with autism. Duplications involving loci associated with behavioural disturbances constitute an especially good candidate mechanism. The Williams-Beuren critical region (WBCR), located at 7q11.23, is commonly deleted in Williams-Beuren microdeletion syndrome (WBS). However, only four patients with a duplication of the WBCR have been reported to date: one with severe language delay and the three others with variable developmental, psychomotor and language delay. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: In this study, we screened 206 patients with autism spectrum disorders for the WBCR duplication by quantitative microsatellite analysis and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. RESULTS: We identified one male patient with a de novo interstitial duplication of the entire WBCR of paternal origin. The patient had autistic disorder, severe language delay and mental retardation, with very mild dysmorphic features. CONCLUSION: We report the first patient with autistic disorder and a WBCR duplication. This observation indicates that the 7q11.23 duplication could be involved in complex clinical phenotypes, ranging from developmental or language delay to mental retardation and autism, and extends the phenotype initially reported. These findings also support the existence of one or several genes in 7q11.23 sensitive to gene dosage and involved in the development of language and social interaction.

16423843|t|Directed evolution of RuBisCO hypermorphs through genetic selection in engineered E.coli.
16423843|a|The Calvin Cycle is the primary conduit for the fixation of carbon dioxide into the biosphere; ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) catalyzes the rate-limiting fixation step. Our goal is to direct the evolution of RuBisCO variants with improved kinetic and biophysical properties. The Calvin Cycle was partially reconstructed in Escherichia coli; the engineered strain requires the Synechococcus PCC6301 RuBisCO for growth in minimal media supplemented with a pentose. We randomly mutated the gene encoding the large subunit of RuBisCO (rbcL), co-expressed the resulting library with the small subunit (rbcS) and the Synechococcus PCC7492 phosphoribulokinase (prkA), and selected hypermorphic variants. The RuBisCO variants that evolved during three rounds of random mutagenesis and selection were over-expressed, and exhibited 5-fold improvement in specific activity relative to the wild-type enzyme. These results demonstrate a new strategy for the artificial selection of RuBisCO and other non-native metabolic enzymes.

18957538|t|Human domain antibodies to conserved sterically restricted regions on gp120 as exceptionally potent cross-reactive HIV-1 neutralizers.
18957538|a|The antibody access to some conserved structures on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is sterically restricted. We have hypothesized that the smallest independently folded antibody fragments (domains) could exhibit exceptionally potent and broadly cross-reactive neutralizing activity by targeting hidden conserved epitopes that are not accessible by larger antibodies. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a large (size 2.5 x 10(10)), highly diversified library of human antibody variable domains (domain antibodies) and used it for selection of binders to conserved Env structures by panning sequentially against Envs from different isolates. The highest affinity binder, m36, neutralized all tested HIV-1 isolates from clades A- D with an activity on average higher than that of C34, a peptide similar to the fusion inhibitor T20, which is in clinical use, and that of m9, which exhibits a neutralizing activity superior to known potent cross-reactive antibodies. Large-size fusion proteins of m36 exhibited diminished neutralizing activity but preincubation of virions with soluble CD4 restored it, suggesting that m36 epitope is sterically restricted and induced by CD4 (CD4i). M36 bound to gp120-CD4 complexes better than to gp120 alone and competed with CD4i antibodies. M36 is the only reported representative of a promising class of potent, broadly cross-reactive HIV-1 inhibitors based on human domain antibodies. It has potential for prevention and therapy and as an agent for exploration of the closely guarded conserved Env structures with implications for design of small molecule inhibitors and elucidation of mechanisms of virus entry and evasion of immune responses.

19058301|t|Surgical outcome of adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas.
19058301|a|Adenosquamous carcinoma is rare, accounting for 3%-4% of all pancreatic carcinoma cases. These tumors are characterized by the presence of variable proportions of mucin-producing glandular elements and squamous components, the latter of which should account for at least 30% of the tumor tissue. Recently, several reports have described cases of adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas. However, as the number of patients who undergo resection at a single institute is limited, large studies describing the clinicopathological features, therapeutic management, and surgical outcome for adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas are lacking. We performed a literature review of English articles retrieved from Medline using the keywords 'pancreas' and 'adenosquamous carcinoma'. Additional articles were obtained from references within the papers identified by the Medline search. Our subsequent review of the literature revealed that optimal adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy regimens for adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas have not been established, and that curative surgical resection offers the only chance for long-term survival. Unfortunately, the prognosis of the 39 patients who underwent pancreatic resection for adenosquamous carcinoma was very poor, with a 3-year overall survival rate of 14.0% and a median survival time of 6.8 mo. Since the postoperative prognosis of adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas is currently worse than that of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, new adjuvant chemotherapies and/or radiation techniques should be investigated as they may prove indispensible to the improvement of surgical outcomes.

15860580|t|The Sca-1 cell surface marker enriches for a prostate-regenerating cell subpopulation that can initiate prostate tumorigenesis.
15860580|a|Sca-1 (stem cell antigen-1) enriches for murine prostate cells capable of regenerating tubular structures containing basal and luminal cell lineages in a dissociated cell prostate regeneration system. Sca-1(+) fractions are enriched for cells at the G(0) stage of the cell cycle, and Sca-1(+) cells cluster in the proximal region of prostatic tubules where replication-quiescent cells have been localized. Castration-induced enrichment for androgen-independent cells results in a concomitant enrichment for Sca-1(+) cells. Genetic perturbations of PTEN/AKT signaling in prostate-regenerating cells leads to the initiation of tumorigenesis, and cancer progression is associated with a dramatic increase in Sca-1(+) cells. Sca-1-enriched prostate-regenerating cells possess multiple stem/progenitor cell properties and can serve as targets for cancer initiation.

He received intrauterine red blood cell transfusions and postnatal chronic transfusion with iron chelation therapy. A non-myeloablative sibling stem cell transplant failed.

15860582|t|Neutrophil microtubules suppress polarity and enhance directional migration.
15860582|a|How do microtubules, which maintain and direct polarity of many eukaryotic cells, regulate polarity of blood neutrophils? In sharp contrast to most cells, disrupting a neutrophil's microtubule network with nocodazole causes it to polarize and migrate [Niggli, V. (2003) J. Cell Sci. 116, 813-822]. Nocodazole induces the same responses in differentiated HL-60 cells, a model neutrophil cell line, and reduces their chemotactic prowess by causing them to pursue abnormally circuitous paths in migrating toward a stationary point source of an attractant, f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). The chemotactic defect stems from dramatic nocodazole-induced imbalance between the divergent, opposed fMLP-induced "backness" and "frontness" signals responsible for neutrophil polarity. Nocodazole (i) stimulates backness by increasing Rho- and actomyosin-dependent contractility, as reported by Niggli, and also (ii) impairs fMLP-dependent frontness: pseudopods are flatter, contain less F-actin, and show decreased membrane translocation of PH-Akt-GFP, a fluorescent marker for 3'-phosphoinositide lipids. Inhibiting backness with a pharmacologic inhibitor of a Rho-dependent kinase substantially reverses nocodazole's effects on chemotaxis, straightness of migration paths, morphology, and PH-Akt-GFP translocation. Thus, microtubules normally balance backness vs. frontness signals, preventing backness from reducing the strength of pseudopods and from impairing directional migration.

15198985|t|In vivo convergence of BMP and MAPK signaling pathways: impact of differential Smad1 phosphorylation on development and homeostasis.
15198985|a|Integration of diverse signaling pathways is essential in development and homeostasis for cells to interpret context-dependent cues. BMP and MAPK signaling converge on Smads, resulting in differential phosphorylation. To understand the physiological significance of this observation, we have generated Smad1 mutant mice carrying mutations that prevent phosphorylation of either the C-terminal motif required for BMP downstream transcriptional activation (Smad1(C) mutation) or of the MAPK motifs in the linker region (Smad1(L) mutation). Smad1(C/C) mutants recapitulate many Smad1(-/-) phenotypes, including defective allantois formation and the lack of primordial germ cells (PGC), but also show phenotypes that are both more severe (head and branchial arches) and less severe (allantois growth) than the null. Smad1(L/L) mutants survive embryogenesis but exhibit defects in gastric epithelial homeostasis correlated with changes in cell contacts, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and nuclear beta-catenin accumulation. In addition, formation of PGCs is impaired in Smad1(L/L) mutants, but restored by allelic complementation in Smad1(C/L) compound mutants. These results underscore the need to tightly balance BMP and MAPK signaling pathways through Smad1.

17873059|t|Dmbx1 is essential in agouti-related protein action.
17873059|a|Dmbx1 is a paired-class homeodomain transcription factor. We show here that mice deficient in Dmbx1 exhibit severe leanness associated with hypophagia and hyperactivity and that isolation of a Dmbx1(-/-) mouse from its cohabitants induces self-starvation, sometimes leading to death, features similar to those of anorexia nervosa in humans. Interestingly, overexpression of agouti in Dmbx1(-/-) mice failed to induce aspects of the A(y)/a phenotype, including hyperphagia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In Dmbx1(-/-) mice, administration of agouti-related protein increased cumulative food intake for the initial 6 h but significantly decreased it over 24- and 48-h periods. In addition, Dmbx1 was shown to be expressed at embryonic day 15.5 in the lateral parabrachial nucleus, the rostral nucleus of the tractus solitarius, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the reticular nucleus in the brainstem, all of which receive melanocortin signaling, indicating involvement of Dmbx1 in the development of the neural network for the signaling. Thus, Dmbx1 is essential for various actions of agouti-related protein and plays a role in normal regulation of energy homeostasis and behavior.

17081700|t|Stress sensitivity in metastatic breast cancer: analysis of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.
17081700|a|The normal diurnal cortisol cycle has a peak in the morning, decreasing rapidly over the day, with low levels during the night, then rising rapidly again to the morning peak. A pattern of flatter daytime slopes has been associated with more rapid cancer progression in both animals and humans. We studied the relationship between the daytime slopes and other daytime cortisol responses to both pharmacological and psychosocial challenges of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function as well as DHEA in a sample of 99 women with metastatic breast cancer, in hopes of elucidating the dysregulatory process. We found that the different components of HPA regulation: the daytime cortisol slope, the rise in cortisol from waking to 30 min later, and cortisol response to various challenges, including dexamethasone (DEX) suppression, corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) activation, and the Trier Social Stress Task, were at best modestly associated. Escape from suppression stimulated by 1mg of DEX administered the night before was moderately but significantly associated with flatter daytime cortisol slopes (r=0.28 to .30 at different times of the post DEX administration day, all p<.01). Daytime cortisol slopes were also moderately but significant associated with the rise in cortisol from waking to 30 min after awakening (r=.29, p=.004, N=96), but not with waking cortisol level (r=-0.13, p=.19). However, we could not detect any association between daytime cortisol slope and activation of cortisol secretion by either CRF infusion or the Trier Social Stress Task. The CRF activation test (following 1.5mg of DEX to assure that the effect was due to exogenous CRF) produced ACTH levels that were correlated (r=0.66, p<.0001, N=74) with serum cortisol levels, indicating adrenal responsiveness to ACTH stimulation. Daytime cortisol slopes were significantly correlated with the slope of DHEA (r=.21, p=.04, N=95). Our general findings suggest that flatter daytime cortisol slopes among metastatic breast cancer patients may be related to disrupted feedback inhibition rather than hypersensitivity in response to stimulation.

19681139|t|Gene expression profiles of lens regeneration and development in Xenopus laevis.
19681139|a|Seven hundred and thirty-four unique genes were recovered from a cDNA library enriched for genes up-regulated during the process of lens regeneration in the frog Xenopus laevis. The sequences represent transcription factors, proteins involved in RNA synthesis/processing, components of prominent cell signaling pathways, genes involved in protein processing, transport, and degradation (e.g., the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway), matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), as well as many other proteins. The findings implicate specific signal transduction pathways in the process of lens regeneration, including the FGF, TGF-beta, MAPK, Retinoic acid, Wnt, and hedgehog signaling pathways, which are known to play important roles in eye/lens development and regeneration in various systems. In situ hybridization revealed that the majority of genes recovered are expressed during embryogenesis, including in eye tissues. Several novel genes specifically expressed in lenses were identified. The suite of genes was compared to those up-regulated in other regenerating tissues/organisms, and a small degree of overlap was detected.

16719794|t|Group I metabotropic receptor neuroprotection requires Akt and its substrates that govern FOXO3a, Bim, and beta-catenin during oxidative stress.
16719794|a|Metabotropic glutamate receptors are expressed throughout the nervous system, but their function as well as their ability to promote neuronal survival rests heavily upon the intracellular mechanisms governed by this family of G-proteins. In this regard, we examined one of the primary pathways that can oversee cell survival, namely protein kinase B (Akt1), and its functional integration with some of its substrates that may work in concert with group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluRI) activation to protect primary hippocampal neurons during oxidative stress. We demonstrate that neuroprotection against free radical injury through mGluRI activation with DHPG requires the activation of Akt1, since loss of Akt1 activity assessed through its GSK-3alpha/beta substrate by pharmacological blockade of the phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase pathway or the gene silencing of Akt1 expression prevents neuronal protection during mGluRI activation. Closely coupled to the robust neuroprotection by mGluRI activation are the inhibitory phosphorylation and prevention of caspase 3 cleavage of the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a, the down-regulation of Bim expression, and the protection of beta-catenin by Akt1 against phosphorylation and degradation to promote its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and allow it to assist with a "pro-survival" cellular program. Further insight into the cellular mechanisms that determine neuronal protection by the metabotropic glutamate system will foster the successful therapeutic development of mGluRs for neurodegenerative disorders.

18835332|t|The influence of chronic lithium administration on deafferentation-induced cellular changes in the chick cochlear nucleus.
18835332|a|The avian brainstem serves as a useful model system to address the question of how afferent activity influences viability of target neurons. Approximately 20-30% of neurons in the chick cochlear nucleus, nucleus magnocellularis (NM) die following deafferentation (i.e. deafness produced by cochlea removal). Previous studies have identified cellular events that occur within hours following cochlea removal, which are thought to lead to the ultimate death of NM neurons. We have recently shown that chronic lithium treatment increases neuronal survival following deafferentation. To assess where in the cell death cascade lithium is having its effect, we evaluated some of the early deafferentation-induced cellular changes in NM neurons. Lithium did not affect deafferentation-induced changes that occur across the entire population of NM neurons. There were still deafferentation-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentrations and early changes in the ribosomes, as indicated by Y10b immunolabeling. Lithium did, however, affect changes that are believed to be indicative of the subpopulation of NM neurons that will eventually die. Ribosomes recovered in all of the deafferented NM neurons (as assessed by Y10b labeling) by 10 h following cochlea removal in subjects pretreated with lithium, while a subpopulation of the NM neurons in saline-treated subjects showed dramatic reduction in Y10b labeling at that time. Lithium treatment also prevented the robust upregulation of b cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) mRNA that is observed in a subpopulation of deafferented NM neurons 6 h following cochlea removal.

12900459|t|A functional overlap of plasminogen and MMPs regulates vascularization during placental development.
12900459|a|Both plasminogen activators and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in a variety of developmental processes in the mouse during embryo implantation and placentation. We show here that pharmacological treatment of plasminogen-deficient mice with the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor galardin leads to a high rate of embryonic lethality. Implantation sites from plasminogen-deficient galardin-treated mice at 7.5 days post coitus (dpc) showed delay in both decidualization and invasion of maternal vessels into the decidua. At 8.5 dpc, half of the embryos were runted and still at the developmental stage of a 7.5 dpc embryo. Most embryos that escaped these initial defects eventually died, probably from defective vascularization and development of the labyrinth layer of the placenta, although a direct role on embryo development cannot be ruled out. These results demonstrate that the combination of MMPs and plasminogen is essential for the proper development of the placenta. Plasminogen deficiency alone and galardin treatment alone had much less effect and there was a pronounced synergism on both placental vascularization and embryonic lethality, indicating a functional overlap between plasminogen and MMPs.

17241145|t|Genes mediate the association between P3 amplitude and externalizing disorders.
17241145|a|Reduced P3 amplitude has been consistently linked to a spectrum of externalizing disorders. Utilizing data from a large sample of adolescent male twins (N=1196), we used biometric modeling to assess the genetic and environmental contributions to the association between reduced P3 amplitude and a general vulnerability to externalizing disorders. Externalizing vulnerability was indexed by a composite of symptoms of conduct disorder, adult antisocial behavior, and alcohol, nicotine, and drug dependence. The sample included two independent age cohorts, providing an internal replication of the findings. For the best-fitting model, genetic influences alone accounted for the association between P3 amplitude and externalizing disorders, with an estimated genetic correlation of r(g)=-.22. Results replicated across the two age cohorts and demonstrate that reduced P3 amplitude is a marker of the biological vulnerability to externalizing disorders.

15331779|t|A hairpin turn in a class II MHC-bound peptide orients residues outside the binding groove for T cell recognition.
15331779|a|T cells generally recognize peptide antigens bound to MHC proteins through contacts with residues found within or immediately flanking the seven- to nine-residue sequence accommodated in the MHC peptide-binding groove. However, some T cells require peptide residues outside this region for activation, the structural basis for which is unknown. Here, we have investigated a HIV Gag-specific T cell clone that requires an unusually long peptide antigen for activation. The crystal structure of a minimally antigenic 16-mer bound to HLA-DR1 shows that the peptide C-terminal region bends sharply into a hairpin turn as it exits the binding site, orienting peptide residues outside the MHC-binding region in position to interact with a T cell receptor. Peptide truncation and substitution studies show that both the hairpin turn and the extreme C-terminal residues are required for T cell activation. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized mode of MHC-peptide-T cell receptor interaction.

17026728|t|Brief report: incidence, etiology, risk factors, and outcome of hospital-acquired fever: a systematic, evidence-based review.
17026728|a|OBJECTIVES: Temperature is universally measured in the hospitalized patient, but the literature on hospital-acquired fever has not been systematically reviewed. This systematic review is intended to provide clinicians with an overview of the incidence, etiology, and outcome of hospital-acquired fever. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE (1970 to 2005), EMBASE (1988 to 2004), and Web of Knowledge. References of all included articles were reviewed. Articles that focused on children, fever in the developing world, classic fever of unknown origin, or specialized patient populations were excluded. REVIEW METHODS: Articles were reviewed independently by 2 authors before inclusion; a third author acted as arbiter. RESULTS: Of over 1,000 studies reviewed, 7 met the criteria for inclusion. The incidence of hospital-acquired fever ranged from 2% to 17%. The etiology of fever was infection in 37% to 74%. Rates of antibiotic use for patients with a noninfectious cause of fever ranged from 29% to 55% for a mean duration of 6.6 to 9.6 days. Studies varied widely in their methodology and the patient population studied. CONCLUSIONS: Limited information is available to guide an evidence-based approach to hospital-acquired fever. We propose criteria to help standardize future studies of this important clinical situation.

15297878|t|Vertical collapse of a cytolysin prepore moves its transmembrane beta-hairpins to the membrane.
15297878|a|Perfringolysin O (PFO) is a prototype of the large family of pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs). A central enigma of the cytolytic mechanism of the CDCs is that their membrane-spanning beta-hairpins (the transmembrane amphipathic beta-hairpins (TMHs)) appear to be approximately 40 A too far above the membrane surface to cross the bilayer and form the pore. We now present evidence, using atomic force microscopy (AFM), of a significant difference in the height by which the prepore and pore protrude from the membrane surface: 113+/-5 A for the prepore but only 73+/-5 A for the pore. Time-lapse AFM micrographs show this change in height in real time. Moreover, the monomers in both complexes exhibit nearly identical surface features and these results in combination with those of spectrofluorimetric analyses indicate that the monomers remain in a perpendicular orientation to the bilayer plane during this transition. Therefore, the PFO undergoes a vertical collapse that brings its TMHs to the membrane surface so that they can extend across the bilayer to form the beta-barrel pore.

19030207|t|Colorectal carcinoma in Lagos and Sagamu, Southwest Nigeria: a histopathological review.
19030207|a|AIM: To study the frequency, gender and age distribution as well as pathological characteristics of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) in Lagos and Sagamu in SW Nigeria. METHODS: This is a retrospective pathological review of histologically diagnosed CRC from 5 laboratories in Lagos and Sagamu. The clinical data, such as age, sex and clinical summary were extracted from demographic information. Cases of anal cancer were excluded from this study. RESULTS: There were 420 cases (237 males and 183 females) of CRC. It peaked in the 60-69 year age group (mean: 50.7; SD: 16.2), M:F ratio 1.3:1 and 23% occurred below 40 years. The majority was well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma 321 (76.4%), mucinous carcinoma 45 (10.7%) and signet ring carcinoma 5 (1.2%), and more common in patients under 40 years compared to well differentiated tumors. The recto-sigmoid colon was the most common site (58.6%). About 51% and 34% of cases presented at TNM stages II and III, respectively. CONCLUSION: CRC is the commonest malignant gastrointestinal (GIT) tumor most commonly located in the recto-sigmoid region. The age and sex prevalence and histopathological features concur with reports from other parts of the world.

16036809|t|Diffusion tensor imaging of subcortical brain injury in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
16036809|a|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to derive in vivo tissue status measurements of subcortical brain regions that are vulnerable to injury in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Quantitative measurements, including the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), were determined in lateralized basal ganglia (caudate and putamen) and centrum semiovale in 11 well-characterized HIV patients and in 11 control subjects. DTI measurements were examined for patterns of relationship with markers of clinical and cognitive progression. DTI measures acquired in subcortical regions were significantly correlated with loss of function in specific cognitive domains. Significant relationships were identified between measures for putamen and verbal memory (MD), visual memory (FA), working memory (FA), and overall cognitive impairment (MD). Measures for caudate (FA) were significantly correlated with visual memory. Measures for centrum semiovale were significantly correlated with visual memory deficits (MD) and visuoconstruction (FA). Relationships between anisotropy measures and anemia (basal ganglia) and CD4 counts (centrum semiovale) were also observed. Findings from this investigation indicate that DTI is a sensitive tool for correlating neuroanatomic pathologic features with specific cognitive deficits in patients with HIV infection.

18842608|t|Striatal degeneration impairs language learning: evidence from Huntington's disease.
18842608|a|Although the role of the striatum in language processing is still largely unclear, a number of recent proposals have outlined its specific contribution. Different studies report evidence converging to a picture where the striatum may be involved in those aspects of rule-application requiring non-automatized behaviour. This is the main characteristic of the earliest phases of language acquisition that require the online detection of distant dependencies and the creation of syntactic categories by means of rule learning. Learning of sequences and categorization processes in non-language domains has been known to require striatal recruitment. Thus, we hypothesized that the striatum should play a prominent role in the extraction of rules in learning a language. We studied 13 pre-symptomatic gene-carriers and 22 early stage patients of Huntington's disease (pre-HD), both characterized by a progressive degeneration of the striatum and 21 late stage patients Huntington's disease (18 stage II, two stage III and one stage IV) where cortical degeneration accompanies striatal degeneration. When presented with a simplified artificial language where words and rules could be extracted, early stage Huntington's disease patients (stage I) were impaired in the learning test, demonstrating a greater impairment in rule than word learning compared to the 20 age- and education-matched controls. Huntington's disease patients at later stages were impaired both on word and rule learning. While spared in their overall performance, gene-carriers having learned a set of abstract artificial language rules were then impaired in the transfer of those rules to similar artificial language structures. The correlation analyses among several neuropsychological tests assessing executive function showed that rule learning correlated with tests requiring working memory and attentional control, while word learning correlated with a test involving episodic memory. These learning impairments significantly correlated with the bicaudate ratio. The overall results support striatal involvement in rule extraction from speech and suggest that language acquisition requires several aspects of memory and executive functions for word and rule learning.

18383033|t|Stellan Hjerten's contribution to the development of monolithic stationary phases.
18383033|a|This overview is presented to celebrate the birthday of one of the luminaries of the separation science and my friend - Stellan Hjerten. He made significant contributions to a variety of areas in separation science such as electrophoresis, LC, and CEC to name just a few. Since the scope of his work was enormous, this review will focus only on a single aspect of his scientific activities, the design and applications of monolithic materials. During the years starting from 1989, Stellan Hjerten published many excellent papers concerning the preparation of acrylamide chemistry-based monoliths and their use in both micro-HPLC and CEC. The following text details his works in the field.

17257691|t|Augmented cocaine conditioned place preference in rats pretreated with systemic ghrelin.
17257691|a|The physiological mechanism through which food restriction (FR) enhances the biobehavioral actions of psychostimulants is unknown but may involve the gut peptide ghrelin. Plasma levels of ghrelin are increased by FR and reduced by eating. Moreover, systemically administered ghrelin crosses into the brain and is known to augment the locomotor-stimulating effects of cocaine [COC: Wellman et al., 2005]. This study sought to determine whether pretreatment with ghrelin (5 nmol) would enhance the rewarding properties of COC (0.0, 0.312, 0.625, or 1.25 mg/kg i.p.) as measured by conditioned place preference (CPP). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given free access to both sides of a CPP chamber to determine initial side preference. The rats were then confined for 30 min to either their preferred side or non-preferred side on 8 consecutive days. When rats were confined to the least preferred side, each was injected with 0.5 ml (i.p.) of either ghrelin (5 nmol) or saline 1 h before the conditioning trial and then injected (i.p.) with one of the COC doses immediately prior to the conditioning trial. On alternate days, rats were injected with vehicle one hour before and again immediately before the conditioning trial. Place preference scores were computed as the differences in time (min) spent on the least preferred side of the chamber for the pre-test and the postconditioning test, covaried by the initial degree of preference (% time spent on the black side during the pre-test). These analyses indicated a significant interaction between ghrelin pretreatment and COC dose on changes in preference scores. Significantly higher place preference scores were noted for rats treated with either 0.312 or 0.625 mg/kg COC doses, but only when these COC doses were preceded by administration of 5 nmol ghrelin. In contrast, saline pretreated rats exhibited significant CPP at the 1.25 mg/kg COC dose, but the ghrelin pretreated group did not. These results provide partial support for the contention that ghrelin pretreatment can augment the rewarding effects of sub-threshold doses of COC in a CPP procedure. Moreover, these findings are consistent with the view that ghrelin may play a role in the capacity of FR to augment psychostimulant action.

15877079|t|Tumour-suppression activity of the proapoptotic regulator Par4.
15877079|a|The proapoptotic protein encoded by Par4 (prostate apoptosis response 4) has been implicated in tumour suppression, particularly in the prostate. We report here that Par4-null mice are prone to develop tumours, both spontaneously and on carcinogenic treatment. The endometrium and prostate of Par4-null mice were particularly sensitive to the development of proliferative lesions. Most (80%) Par4-null females presented endometrial hyperplasia by 9 months of age, and a significant proportion (36%) developed endometrial adenocarcinomas after 1 year of age. Similarly, Par4-null males showed a high incidence of prostate hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias, and were extraordinarily sensitive to testosterone-induced prostate hyperplasia. Finally, the uterus and prostate of young Par4-null mice have increased levels of the apoptosis inhibitor XIAP (X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis), supporting the previously proposed function of Par4 as an inhibitor of the (zeta)PKC (atypical protein kinase)-NF-(kappa)B (nuclear factor-(kappa)B)-XIAP pathway. These data show that Par4 has an important role in tumour suppression, with a particular relevance in the endometrium and prostate.

18759002|t|The effect of 15 consecutive days of heat-exercise acclimation on heat shock protein 70.
18759002|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate the alterations in serum heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 levels during a 15-consecutive-day intermittent heat-exercise protocol in a 29-year-old male ultra marathon runner. Heat acclimation, for the purpose of physical activities in elevated ambient temperatures, has numerous physiological benefits including mechanisms such as improved cardiac output, increased plasma volume and a decreased core temperature (T (c)). In addition to the central adaptations, the role of Hsp during heat acclimation has received an increasing amount of attention. The acclimation protocol applied was designed to correspond with the athlete's tapering period for the 2007 Marathon Des Sables. The subject (VO(2)max = 50.7 ml.kg(-1).min(-1), peak power output [PPO] = 376 W) cycled daily for 90 min at a workload corresponding to 50% of VO(2)max in a temperature-controlled room (average WBGT = 31.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C). Venous blood was sampled before and after each session for measurement of serum osmolality and serum Hsp70. In addition, T (c), heart rate (HR) and power output (PO) was measured throughout the 90 min to ensure that heat acclimation was achieved during the 15-day period. The results show that the subject was successfully heat acclimated as seen by the lowered HR at rest and during exercise, decreased resting and exercising T (c) and an increased PO. The heat exercise resulted in an initial increase in Hsp70 concentrations, known as thermotolerance, and the increase in Hsp70 after exercise was inversely correlated to the resting values of Hsp70 (Spearman's rank correlation = -0.81, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the 15-day heat-exercise protocol also increased the basal levels of Hsp70, a response different from that of thermotolerance. This is, as far as we are aware, the first report showing Hsp70 levels during consecutive days of intermittent heat exposure giving rise to heat acclimation. In conclusion, a relatively longer heat acclimation protocol is suggested to obtain maximum benefit of heat acclimation inclusive of both cellular and systemic adaptations.

18347946|t|Substitution of only two residues of human Hsp90alpha causes impeded dimerization of Hsp90beta.
18347946|a|Two isoforms of the 90-kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp90), i.e., Hsp90alpha and Hsp90beta, are expressed in the cytosol of mammalian cells. Although Hsp90 predominantly exists as a dimer, the dimer-forming potential of the beta isoform of human and mouse Hsp90 is less than that of the alpha isoform. The 16 amino acid substitutions located in the 561-685 amino acid region of the C-terminal dimerization domain should be responsible for this impeded dimerization of Hsp90beta (Nemoto T, Ohara-Nemoto Y, Ota M, Takagi T, Yokoyama K. Eur J Biochem 233: 1-8, 1995). The present study was performed to define the amino acid substitutions that cause the impeded dimerization of Hsp90beta. Bacterial two-hybrid analysis revealed that among the 16 amino acids, the conversion from Ala(558) of Hsp90beta to Thr(566) of Hsp90alpha and that from Met(621) of Hsp90beta to Ala(629) of Hsp90alpha most efficiently reversed the dimeric interaction, and that the inverse changes from those of Hsp90alpha to Hsp90beta primarily explained the impeded dimerization of Hsp90beta We conclude that taken together, the conversion of Thr(566) and Ala(629) of Hsp90alpha to Ala(558) and Met(621) is primarily responsible for impeded dimerization of Hsp90beta.

18048067|a|Deposition of amyloid around blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is a major pathological feature found in the majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, and activated complement fragments have been detected on CAA deposits in AD brains. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that human cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells (HCSMC) isolated from cortical vessels derived from postmortem brains can express mRNAs for complement genes C1qB, C1r, C1s, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9, the components of the classical complement pathway. Secretion of the corresponding complement proteins for these genes was also demonstrated, except for C1q and C5. Of particular significance was the observation that treatment of HCSMC with aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) 1-42 increased expression of complement C3 mRNA and increased release of C3 protein. Abeta treatment of HCSMC also increased expression of C6 mRNA. Interferon-gamma induced expression and release of complement C1r, C1s, C2 and C4. As HCSMC are closely associated with Abeta deposits in vessels in the brain, their production of complement proteins could amplify the proinflammatory effects of amyloid in the perivascular environment, further compromising brain vascular integrity.

17263688|t|Distinct roles of the C2A and the C2B domain of the vesicular Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin 9 in endocrine beta-cells.
17263688|a|Synaptotagmins form a family of calcium-sensor proteins implicated in exocytosis, and these vesicular transmembrane proteins are endowed with two cytosolic calcium-binding C2 domains, C2A and C2B. Whereas the isoforms syt1 and syt2 have been studied in detail, less is known about syt9, the calcium sensor involved in endocrine secretion such as insulin release from large dense core vesicles in pancreatic beta-cells. Using cell-based assays to closely mimic physiological conditions, we observed SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein-attachment protein receptor)-independent translocation of syt9C2AB to the plasma membrane at calcium levels corresponding to endocrine exocytosis, followed by internalization to endosomes. The use of point mutants and truncations revealed that initial translocation required only the C2A domain, whereas the C2B domain ensured partial pre-binding of syt9C2AB to the membrane and post-stimulatory localization to endosomes. In contrast with the known properties of neuronal and neuroendocrine syt1 or syt2, the C2B domain of syt9 did not undergo calcium-dependent membrane binding despite a high degree of structural homology as observed through molecular modelling. The present study demonstrates distinct intracellular properties of syt9 with different roles for each C2 domain in endocrine cells.

15257291|t|T4 AsiA blocks DNA recognition by remodeling sigma70 region 4.
15257291|a|Bacteriophage T4 AsiA is a versatile transcription factor capable of inhibiting host gene expression as an 'anti-sigma' factor while simultaneously promoting gene-specific expression of T4 middle genes in conjunction with T4 MotA. To accomplish this task, AsiA engages conserved region 4 of Eschericia coli sigma70, blocking recognition of most host promoters by sequestering the DNA-binding surface at the AsiA/sigma70 interface. The three-dimensional structure of an AsiA/region 4 complex reveals that the C-terminal alpha helix of region 4 is unstructured, while four other helices adopt a completely different conformation relative to the canonical structure of unbound region 4. That AsiA induces, rather than merely stabilizes, this rearrangement can be realized by comparison to the homologous structures of region 4 solved in a variety of contexts, including the structure of Thermotoga maritima sigmaA region 4 described herein. AsiA simultaneously occupies the surface of region 4 that ordinarily contacts core RNA polymerase (RNAP), suggesting that an AsiA-bound sigma70 may also undergo conformational changes in the context of the RNAP holoenzyme.

19572074|t|Immune versus thrombotic stimulation of platelets differentially regulates signalling pathways, intracellular protein-protein interactions, and alpha-granule release.
19572074|a|In addition to haemostasis, platelets mediate inflammation and clearance of bacteria from the bloodstream. As with platelet-platelet interactions, platelet-bacteria interactions involve cytoskeletal rearrangements and release of granular content. Stimulation of the immune Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on the platelet surface, activates phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and causes platelet activation and platelet-dependent thrombosis. It remains unknown if platelet activation by immune versus thrombotic pathways leads to the differential regulation of signal transduction, protein-protein interactions, and alpha-granule release, and the physiological relevance of these potential differences. We investigated these processes after immune versus thrombotic platelet stimulation. We examined selected signalling pathways and found that phosphorylation kinetics of Akt, ERK1/2 and p38 differed dramatically between agonists. Next, we investigated platelet protein-protein interactions by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics specifically targeting cytosolic factor XIIIa (FXIIIa) because of its function as a cytoskeleton-crosslinking protein whose binding partners have limited characterisation. Four FXIIIa-binding proteins were identified, two of which are novel interactions: FXIIIa-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and FXIIIa-gelsolin. The binding of FAK to FXIIIa was found to be altered differentially by immune versus thrombotic stimulation. Lastly, we studied the effect of thrombin versus Pam(3)CSK(4) stimulation on alpha-granule release and observed differential release patterns for selected granule proteins and decreased fibrin clot formation compared with thrombin. The inhibition of PI3K caused a decrease in protein release after Pam(3)CSK(4)- but not after thrombin-stimulation. In summary, stimulation of platelets by either thrombotic or immune receptors leads to markedly different signalling responses and granular protein release consistent with differential contribution to coagulation and thrombosis.

18022851|t|Technology preview: X-ray fused with magnetic resonance during invasive cardiovascular procedures.
18022851|a|BACKGROUND: We have developed and validated a system for real-time X-ray fused with magnetic resonance imaging, MRI (XFM), to guide catheter procedures with high spatial precision. Our implementation overlays roadmaps-MRI-derived soft-tissue features of interest-onto conventional X-ray fluoroscopy. We report our initial clinical experience applying XFM, using external fiducial markers, electrocardiogram (ECG)- gating, and automated real-time correction for gantry and table movement. METHODS: This prospective case series for technical development was approved by the NHLBI Institutional Review Board and included 19 subjects. Multimodality external fiducial markers were affixed to patients' skin before MRI, which included contrast-enhanced, 3D T1-weighted, or breath-held and ECG-gated 2D steady state free precession imaging at 1.5T. MRI-derived roadmaps were manually segmented while patients were transferred to a calibrated X-ray fluoroscopy system. Image spaces were registered using the fiducial markers and thereafter permitted unrestricted gantry rotation, table panning, and magnification changes. Static and ECG-gated MRI data were transformed from 3D to 2D to correspond with gantry and table position and combined with live X-ray images. RESULTS: Clinical procedures included graft coronary arteriography, right ventricular free-wall biopsy, and iliac and femoral artery recanalization and stenting. MRI roadmaps improved operator confidence, and in the biopsy cases, outperformed the best available alternative imaging modality. Registration errors were increased when external fiducial markers were affixed to more mobile skin positions, such as over the abdomen. CONCLUSION: XFM using external fiducial markers is feasible during X-ray guided catheter treatments. Multimodality image fusion may prove a useful adjunct to invasive cardiovascular procedures.

17368109|t|Psychiatric disorders and behavioral characteristics of pediatric patients with both epilepsy and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
17368109|a|OBJECTIVE: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) coexisting with epilepsy is poorly understood; thus, we compared the clinical correlates and psychiatric comorbid conditions of 36 children with epilepsy and ADHD aged 6 to 17 years enrolled in an ADHD treatment trial, with those reported in the literature on children with ADHD without epilepsy. METHODS: Measures included the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (KSADS), the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), and the Scales for Independent Behavior-Revised (SIB-R). RESULTS: Mean IQ was 86+/-19, and SIB-R Standard Score was 72+/-26. The ADHD-Combined subtype, composed of both inattentive and hyperactive symptoms, was most frequent (58%). Sixty-one percent exhibited a comorbid disorder, including anxiety disorders (36%) and oppositional defiant disorder (31%). CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity in ADHD with epilepsy is similar to that in ADHD without epilepsy reported in the literature. These preliminary data argue that the pathophysiology of ADHD has common components in both populations.

17591544|t|Ethanol acts directly on extrasynaptic subtypes of GABAA receptors to increase tonic inhibition.
17591544|a|Based on the similarity of ethanol intoxication to the behavioral effects of drugs known to target gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors (GABARs), it has been suspected for decades that ethanol facilitates the activity of GABA. Even so, it has been surprisingly difficult to identify molecular targets of ethanol. Research conducted over the past several years suggests that a subclass of GABARs (those containing delta subunits) responds in a relevant concentration range to ethanol. Although delta subunit-containing GABARs are not ubiquitously expressed at inhibitory synapses like their gamma subunit-containing, synaptic counterparts, they are found in many neurons in extrasynaptic locations. Here, they give rise to a tonic form of inhibition that can potently suppress neuronal excitability. Studies have shown that both recombinant and native delta subunit-containing GABARs (1) are modulated by behaviorally relevant (i.e., low millimolar) concentrations of ethanol, (2) directly bind ethanol over the same concentration range, (3) show altered function upon single amino substitutions linked to changes in behavioral responsiveness to ethanol, and (4) are a site of action of Ro15-4513, a competitive antagonist of ethanol binding and a drug which prevents many of the behavioral aspects of ethanol intoxication. Despite such comprehensive evidence, however, the field is not free from controversy. This review evaluates published data for and against a central role of delta subunit-containing GABARs in ethanol actions and suggests future directions that might help settle points of controversy.

16903868|t|Enhanced neutrophil motility by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
16903868|a|The effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on human neutrophil motility was studied using videomicroscopy. Stimulation of neutrophils with G-CSF resulted in enhanced motility with morphological change and increased adherence. Enhanced neutrophil motility was detected within 3-5 min after G-CSF stimulation, reached a maximum at 10 min, and was sustained for approximately 35 min. The maximum migration rate was 84.4 +/- 2.9 microm/5 min. A study using the Boyden chamber method revealed that G-CSF-stimulated neutrophils exhibited random migration but not chemotaxis. Enhanced neutrophil motility and morphological change were inhibited by MEK [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase] inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126), and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (wortmannin), but not by a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580). These findings are consistent with the fact that G-CSF selectively activates MEK/ERK and PI3K, but not p38, in neutrophils. MEK/ERK activation was associated with G-CSF-induced redistribution of F-actin and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Enhanced neutrophil motility was observed even in the presence of neutralizing anti-CD18 antibody, which prevented cell adherence. These findings indicate that G-CSF induces human neutrophil migration via activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K.

19392962|t|Treatment practices of mild cognitive impairment in California Alzheimer's Disease Centers.
19392962|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine "real world" treatments for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: California Department of Public Health Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Research Centers of California. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred seventy-eight patients diagnosed with MCI. MEASUREMENTS: All patients underwent comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological evaluations. Logistic regression models were used to determine patient characteristics associated with use of anti-AD medications, statins, antioxidants, and folic acid. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six patients (28.7%) were taking anti-AD medications; use was associated with greater functional impairment, higher education, MCI subtype, and older age (P<.05 for all). Two hundred fifty-two patients (43.6%) were taking statins; use was associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, myocardial infarct, male sex, and MCI subtype (P<.05 for all). One hundred fifteen patients (19.9%) were taking antioxidants; use was associated with higher education and diabetes mellitus and varied according to site (P<.05 for all). Thirty-seven patients (6.4%) were taking folic acid; use was associated with nonwhite race, male sex, and greater functional impairment (P<.05 for all). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that patients with MCI are frequently being treated with "off label" cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, as well as other possible cognition-enhancing drugs. Further investigation of the effect of treatment patterns on the clinical course of MCI is needed.

17085266|t|Symptom experience in the last year of life among individuals with cancer.
17085266|a|Individuals with cancer often experience many symptoms that impair their quality of life at the end of life. This study examines symptom experience at end of life among individuals with cancer, and determines if symptom experience changes with proximity to death, or differs by depressive symptomatology, sex, site of cancer, or age. A secondary analysis of data from three prospective, descriptive, longitudinal studies (n=174) was performed, using a three-level hierarchical linear model. Fatigue, weakness, pain, shortness of breath, and cough were the five most prevalent symptoms in the last year of life. The symptom experience in the last year of life was significantly associated with site of cancer, depressive symptomatology, dependencies in activities of daily living, and independent activities of daily living at the start of the study. These findings shed light on the symptom experience in the last year of life for individuals with cancer. With greater understanding of the symptom experience, intervention strategies can be targeted to achieve the desired outcome of increased quality of life at the end of life.

14760518|t|Vitamin A intake and the risk of hip fracture in postmenopausal women: the Iowa Women's Health Study.
14760518|a|Excessive intake of vitamin A is postulated to have a detrimental effect on bone by inducing osteoporosis. This may lead to an increased risk of fracture, particularly in persons who are already at risk of osteoporosis. However, few studies have specifically examined the association of vitamin A intake through diet and supplement use, with fractures in a cohort of older, community-dwelling women. We prospectively followed a cohort of 34,703 postmenopausal women from the Iowa Women's Health Study to determine if high levels of vitamin A and retinol intake through food and supplement use were associated with an increased risk of hip or all fractures. A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to obtain the participants' baseline vitamin A and retinol intake. Participants were followed for a mean duration of 9.5 years for incident self-reported hip and nonhip fractures. After multivariate adjustment, it was revealed that users of supplements containing vitamin A had a 1.18-fold increased risk of incident hip fracture (n = 525) compared with nonusers (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.41), but there was no evidence of an increased risk of all fractures (n = 6,502) among supplement users. There was also no evidence of a dose-response relationship in hip fracture risk with increasing amounts of vitamin A or retinol from supplements. Furthermore, our results showed no association between vitamin A or retinol intake from food and supplements, or food only, and the risk of hip or all fractures. In conclusion, we found little evidence of an increased risk of hip or all fractures with higher intakes of vitamin A or retinol among a cohort of older, postmenopausal women.

12386918|t|Antigen-specific tumor vaccine efficacy in vivo against prostate cancer with low class I MHC requires competent class II MHC.
12386918|a|BACKGROUND: Cancers can escape immune recognition by means of evading class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -mediated recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. However, immunization strategies targeting defined tumor-associated antigens have not been extensively characterized in murine prostate cancer models. Therefore, we evaluated antigen-specific, antitumor immunity after antigen-encoding vaccinia immunization against mouse prostate cancer cells expressing a model tumor-associated antigen (beta-galactosidase) and exhibiting partially deficient class I MHC. METHODS AND RESULTS: Low class I MHC expression in beta-galactosidase-expressing D7RM-1 prostate cancer cells was shown by fluorescence activated cell sorting, and deficient class I MHC-mediated antigen presentation was shown in resistance of D7RM-1 to cytolysis by beta-galactosidase-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Despite partially deficient class I MHC presenting function, immunization with vaccinia encoding beta-galactosidase conferred antigen-specific protection against D7RM-1 cancer. Antigen-specific immunity was recapitulated in beta(2)m knockout mice (with deficient class I MHC and CTL function), confirming that class I MHC antigen presentation was not required for immunity against tumor partially deficient in class I MHC. Conversely, antigen-specific antitumor immunity was abrogated in A(b)beta knockout mice (with deficient class II MHC and helper T cell function), demonstrating a requirement for functional class II MHC. Resistant tumors from the otherwise effectively immunized beta(2)m knockout mice (among which tumor progression had been reduced or delayed) showed reduced target antigen expression, corroborating antigen-specificity (and showing an alternative immune escape mechanism), whereas antigen expression (like tumor growth) was unaffected among A(b)beta knockout mice. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that class I MHC-restricted antigen presentation and CTL activity is neither necessary nor sufficient for antigen-encoding vaccinia immunization to induce protective immunity against class I MHC-low tumors, whereas host class II MHC-mediated antigen presentation facilitates antigen-specific immunity against prostate cancer in vivo. Reduced expression of the target antigen developed rapidly in vivo as an immune escape mechanism for such cancers.

15075294|t|TopBP1 recruits Brg1/Brm to repress E2F1-induced apoptosis, a novel pRb-independent and E2F1-specific control for cell survival.
15075294|a|TopBP1 (DNA topoisomerase IIbeta binding protein I) contains multiple BRCT domains and is involved in replication and the DNA damage checkpoint. Through its BRCT domain, TopBP1 interacts with and represses exclusively E2F1 but not other E2F factors. This regulation of E2F1 transcriptional activity is mediated by a pRb-independent, but Brg1/Brm-dependent mechanism. TopBP1 recruits Brg1/Brm, a central component of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, to E2F1-responsive promoters and represses the activities of E2F1, but not E2F2 or E2F3. This regulation is crucial in the control of E2F1-dependent apoptosis during normal cell growth and DNA damage. Interestingly, TopBP1 is induced by E2F and interacts with E2F1 during G1/S transition. Thus, TopBP1 functions as a critical modulator and serves as a negative feedback regulator of E2F1 by inhibiting E2F1-dependent apoptosis during G1/S transition as well as DNA damage to promote cell survival.

16049177|t|Neurofilament polymer transport in axons.
16049177|a|Neurofilament proteins are known to be transported along axons by slow axonal transport, but the form in which they move is controversial. In previous studies on cultured rat sympathetic neurons, we found that green fluorescent protein-tagged neurofilament proteins move predominantly in the form of filamentous structures, and we proposed that these structures are single-neurofilament polymers. In the present study, we have tested this hypothesis by using a rapid perfusion technique to capture these structures as they move through naturally occurring gaps in the axonal neurofilament array. Because the gaps lack neurofilaments, they permit unambiguous identification of the captured structure. Using quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy, we show that the captured structures are single continuous neurofilament polymers. Thus, neurofilament polymers are one of the cargo structures of slow axonal transport.

16675336|t|Endotoxin in inner-city homes: associations with wheeze and eczema in early childhood.
16675336|a|BACKGROUND: An inverse association between domestic exposure to endotoxin and atopy in childhood has been observed. The relevance of this aspect of the hygiene hypothesis to US inner-city communities that have disproportionately high asthma prevalence has not been determined. OBJECTIVES: To measure endotoxin in the dust from inner-city homes, evaluate associations between endotoxin and housing/lifestyle characteristics, and determine whether endotoxin exposure predicted wheeze, allergic rhinitis, and eczema over the first 3 years of life. METHODS: As part of an ongoing prospective birth cohort study, children of Dominican and African-American mothers living in New York City underwent repeated questionnaire measures. Dust samples collected from bedroom floors at age 12 or 36 months were assayed for endotoxin. RESULTS: Among the samples collected from 301 participants' homes, the geometric mean endotoxin concentration (95% CI) was 75.9 EU/mg (66-87), and load was 3892 EU/m2 (3351-4522). Lower endotoxin concentrations were associated with wet mop cleaning and certain neighborhoods. Endotoxin concentration correlated weakly with cockroach (Bla g 2: r = 0.22, P < .001) and mouse (mouse urinary protein: r = 0.28; P < .001) allergens in the dust. Children in homes with higher endotoxin concentration were less likely to have eczema at age 1 year (odds ratio, 0.70 [0.53-0.93]) and more likely to wheeze at age 2 years (odds ratio, 1.34 [1.01-1.78]). These associations were stronger among children with a maternal history of asthma. CONCLUSION: Endotoxin levels in this inner-city community are similar to those in nonfarm homes elsewhere. In this community, domestic endotoxin exposure was inversely associated with eczema at age 1 year, but positively associated with wheeze at age 2 years. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Endotoxin exposure in the inner-city community may be related to wheeze in the early life; however, given the inverse association seen with eczema, the long-term development of allergic disease is still in question.

17540480|t|Adipokines and the blood-brain barrier.
17540480|a|Just as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is not a static barrier, the adipocytes are not inert storage depots. Adipokines are peptides or polypeptides produced by white adipose tissue; they play important roles in normal physiology as well as in the metabolic syndrome. Adipokines secreted into the circulation can interact with the BBB and exert potent CNS effects. The specific transport systems for two important adipokines, leptin and tumor necrosis factor alpha, have been characterized during the past decade. By contrast, transforming growth factor beta-1 and adiponectin do not show specific permeation across the BBB, but modulate endothelial functions. Still others, like interleukin-6, may reach the brain but are rapidly degraded. This review summarizes current knowledge and recent findings of the rapidly growing family of adipokines and their interactions with the BBB.

15548613|t|The structure of carbonmonoxy neuroglobin reveals a heme-sliding mechanism for control of ligand affinity.
15548613|a|Neuroglobin (Ngb), a globular heme protein expressed in the brain of vertebrates, binds oxygen reversibly, with an affinity comparable to myoglobin (Mb). Despite low sequence identity, the overall 3D fold of Ngb and Mb is very similar. Unlike in Mb, in Ngb the sixth coordination position of the heme iron is occupied by the distal histidine, in the absence of an exogenous ligand. Endogenous ligation has been proposed as a unique mechanism for affinity regulation and ligand discrimination in heme proteins. This peculiarity might be related to the still-unknown physiological function of Ngb. Here, we present the x-ray structure of CO-bound ferrous murine Ngb at 1.7 A and a comparison with the 1.5-A structure of ferric bis-histidine Ngb. We have also used Fourier transform IR spectroscopy of WT and mutant CO-ligated Ngb to examine structural heterogeneity in the active site. Upon CO binding, the distal histidine retains (by and large) its position, whereas the heme group slides deeper into a preformed crevice, thereby reshaping the large cavity ( approximately 290 A(3)) connecting the distal and proximal heme sides with the bulk. The heme relocation is accompanied by a significant decrease of structural disorder, especially of the EF loop, which may be the signal whereby Ngb communicates hypoxic conditions. This unexpected structural change unveils a heme-sliding mechanism of affinity control that may be of significance to understanding Ngb's role in the pathophysiology of the brain.

15548610|t|GC/AT-content spikes as genomic punctuation marks.
15548610|a|Large-scale analysis of the GC-content distribution at the gene level reveals both common features and basic differences in genomes of different groups of species. Sharp changes in GC content are detected at the transcription boundaries for all species analyzed, including human, mouse, rat, chicken, fruit fly, and worm. However, two substantially distinct groups of GC-content profiles can be recognized: warm-blooded vertebrates including human, mouse, rat, and chicken, and invertebrates including fruit fly and worm. In vertebrates, sharp positive and negative spikes of GC content are observed at the transcription start and stop sites, respectively, and there is also a progressive decrease in GC content from the 5' untranslated region to the 3' untranslated region along the gene. In invertebrates, the positive and negative GC-content spikes at the transcription start and stop sites are preceded by spikes of opposite value, and the highest GC content is found in the coding regions of the genes. Cross-correlation analysis indicates high frequencies of GC-content spikes at transcription start and stop sites. The strong conservation of this genomic feature seen in comparisons of the human/mouse and human/rat orthologs, and the clustering of genes with GC-content spikes on chromosomes imply a biological function. The GC-content spikes at transcription boundaries may reflect a general principle of genomic punctuation. Our analysis also provides means for identifying these GC-content spikes in individual genomic sequences.

18583894|t|Acute interstitial pneumonia in siblings: a case report.
18583894|a|Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) is a rapidly progressive condition of unknown cause that occurs in a previously healthy individual and produces the histologic findings of diffuse alveolar damage. Since the term AIP was first introduced in 1986, there have been very few case reports of AIP in children. Here we present a case of AIP in a 3-yr-old girl whose other two siblings showed similar radiologic findings. The patient was confirmed to have AIP from autopsy showing histological findings of diffuse alveolar damage and proliferation of fibroblasts. Her 3-yr-old brother was also clinically and radiologically highly suspected as having AIP, and the other asymptomatic 8-yr-old sister was radiologically suspected as having AIP.

17767413|t|Host choice and West Nile virus infection rates in blood-fed mosquitoes, including members of the Culex pipiens complex, from Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, 2002-2003.
17767413|a|The source of bloodmeals in 2,082 blood-fed mosquitoes collected from February 2002 through December 2003 in Memphis and surrounding areas of Shelby County, Tennessee were determined. Members of the genus Culex and Anopheles quadrimaculatus predominated in the collections. Members of the Cx. pipiens complex and Cx. restuans were found to feed predominately upon avian hosts, though mammalian hosts made up a substantial proportion of the bloodmeals in these species. No significant difference was seen in the host class of bloodmeals in mosquitoes identified as Cx. pipiens pipiens, Cx. p. quinquefasciatus, or hybrids between these two taxa. Anopheles quadrimaculatus and Cx. erraticus fed primarily upon mammalian hosts. Three avian species (the American Robin, the Common Grackle, and the Northern Cardinal) made up the majority of avian-derived bloodmeals, with the American Robin representing the most frequently fed upon avian host. An analysis of these host feeding data using a modification of a transmission model for Eastern Equine encephalitis virus suggested that the American Robin and Common Grackle represented the most important reservoir hosts for West Nile virus. A temporal analysis of the feeding patterns of the dominant Culex species did not support a shift in feeding behavior away from robins to mammals late in the summer. However, a significant degree of temporal variation was noted in the proportion of robin-derived bloodmeals when the data were analyzed by semi-monthly periods throughout the summers of 2002 and 2003. This pattern was consistent with the hypothesis that the mosquitoes were preferentially feeding upon nesting birds.

18303201|t|Acute effects of Asian dust events on respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow in children with mild asthma.
18303201|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the possible adverse effects of Asian dust events on respiratory health in asthmatic children. Fifty-two children with mild asthma were studied for eight consecutive weeks in the spring of 2004 (March 8 to May 2). During the study period, five Asian dust days were identified; we included a lag period of two days following each of the events. Subjects recorded their respiratory symptom diaries and peak expiratory flow (PEF) twice daily during the study period; and they underwent methacholine bronchial challenge tests. The subjects reported a significantly higher frequency of respiratory symptoms during the Asian dust days than during the control days. They showed significantly more reduced morning and evening PEF values, and more increased PEF variability (10.1%+/-3.5% vs. 5.5%+/-2.2%) during the Asian dust days than during the control days. Methacholine PC(20) was not significantly different between before and after the study period (geometric mean: 2.82 mg/mL vs. 3.16 mg/mL). These results suggest that the short-term Asian dust events might be associated with increased acute respiratory symptoms and changes in PEF outcomes. However, there might be little long-term influence on airway hyperresponsiveness in children with mild asthma.

17034582|t|The membrane attack pathway of complement drives pathology in passively induced experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis in mice.
17034582|a|The human neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by the generation of autoantibodies reactive with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) that cause loss of AChR from the neuromuscular end-plate with resultant failure of neuromuscular transmission. A role for complement (C) in AChR loss has been suggested based upon morphological identification of C at the end-plate in MG and from the effects of C inhibition in murine models. Here we provide further evidence implicating C, and specifically the membrane attack complex (MAC), in a mouse model of MG. Mice deficient in the C regulators Daf1 and/or Cd59a were tested in the model. Wild-type mice were resistant to disease while mice deficient in Daf1 had mild disease symptoms with evidence of C activation and AChR loss at end-plates. Cd59a-deficient mice had very mild disease with some muscle inflammation and essentially undamaged end-plates. In contrast, mice deficient in both C regulators developed a severe paralytic disease with marked muscle inflammation and loss of end-plates. Inhibition of MAC assembly abrogated clinical disease in these double-deficient mice, demonstrating conclusively that MAC formation was driving pathology in the model. These findings provoke us to suggest that current anti-C therapeutics targeting MAC assembly will be beneficial in MG patients resistant to conventional therapies.

15931286|t|Recombinant TSH-stimulated, radioguided differentiated thyroid carcinoma surgery.
15931286|a|A novel approach to locating and surgically resecting occult metastatic foci in a 25-year-old female with a history of total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma was attempted. Two iodine-131 (131I) body scans were performed: one after the patient underwent a 2-3 week thyroxine withdrawal, and another the following week utilizing recombinant TSH-stimulation. Then the patient was treated with 151 mCi of 131I, and 2 weeks later, without further hormonal manipulation, she had radioguided surgery. The two diagnostic 131I body scans were negative, but the post-therapy scan was positive. Two weeks later after pre-operative skin marking, radioguided surgery localized metastatic foci in the central compartment neck just dorsal to the suprasternal notch. No other foci were identified with the probe at surgery. At pathology, 2 of the 12 nodes were positive, as well as a 1 mm metastatic focus in the fat. Provocative imaging protocols, aggressive radioiodine therapy, and the novel use of radioguided surgery to attempt a cure in an 131I image-negative metastatic thyroid carcinoma patient was performed. No other cases using these combined diagnostic and therapeutic efforts have been reported in the literature.

17587819|t|Complexity in interpretation of embryonic epithelial-mesenchymal transition in response to transforming growth factor-beta signaling.
17587819|a|Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a highly conserved and fundamental process that governs morphogenesis in development and may also contribute to cancer metastasis. Transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) is a potent inducer of EMT in various developmental and tumor systems. The analysis of TGF-beta signal transduction pathways is now considered a critically important area of biology, since many defects occur in these pathways in embryonic development. The complexity of TGF-beta signal transduction networks is overwhelming due to the large numbers of interacting constituents, complicated feedforward, feedback and crosstalk circuitry mechanisms that they involve in addition to the cellular kinetics and enzymatics that contribute to cell signaling. As a result of this complexity, apparently simple but highly important questions remain unanswered, that is, how do epithelial cells respond to such TGF-beta signals? System biology and cellular kinetics play a crucial role in cellular function; omissions of such a critical contributor may lead to inaccurate understanding of embryonic EMT. In this review, we identify and explain why certain conditions need to be considered for a true representation of TGF-beta signaling in vivo to better understand the controlled, yet delicate mechanism of embryonic EMT.

15212121|t|Cerivastatin does not prevent oxidative injury of human aortic endothelial cells.
15212121|a|The anti-atherogenic properties of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been well established in several circulatory beds. Increasing evidence suggests that statins may help attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury, a beneficial effect that may be related to the antioxidant capabilities of statins; however, this remains controversial. We performed this study to determine whether the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor cerivastatin can prevent oxidative stress-induced injury in cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). The HAEC were subjected to oxidative stress in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of cerivastatin (50 nM-1,000 nM). Oxidative stress was induced by increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or endogenous superoxide anions generated by the inhibition of superoxide dismutase using diethylthiocarbamate (10 mM). Cell viability and mitochondrial activity were measured by mitochondria-dependent 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) conversion. Cell morphology was also examined using light microscopy. Exposing HAEC to cerivastatin for 24 hours had no effect on cell viability using both cell morphology and MTT conversion: the HAEC incubated in 100 nM cerivastatin had 90% +/- 2.2% viability of the control. As expected, hydrogen peroxide produced a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability. Varying concentrations of cerivastatin pretreatment for < or = 18 hours showed no protection of HAEC against hydrogen peroxide-induced injury. As a positive control, the prototype antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine was cytoprotective even with the highest hydrogen peroxide concentration. Neither cerivastatin nor N-acetyl-L-cysteine protected HAEC against diethylthiocarbamate-induced oxidative injury at any concentration. In this study, cerivastatin did not protect cultured HAEC against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide or diethylthiocarbamate.

15257297|t|Muscleblind proteins regulate alternative splicing.
15257297|a|Although the muscleblind (MBNL) protein family has been implicated in myotonic dystrophy (DM), a specific function for these proteins has not been reported. A key feature of the RNA-mediated pathogenesis model for DM is the disrupted splicing of specific pre-mRNA targets. Here we demonstrate that MBNL proteins regulate alternative splicing of two pre-mRNAs that are misregulated in DM, cardiac troponin T (cTNT) and insulin receptor (IR). Alternative cTNT and IR exons are also regulated by CELF proteins, which were previously implicated in DM pathogenesis. MBNL proteins promote opposite splicing patterns for cTNT and IR alternative exons, both of which are antagonized by CELF proteins. CELF- and MBNL-binding sites are distinct and regulation by MBNL does not require the CELF-binding site. The results are consistent with a mechanism for DM pathogenesis in which expanded repeats cause a loss of MBNL and/or gain of CELF activities, leading to misregulation of alternative splicing of specific pre-mRNA targets.

15574592|t|Phosphorylation of a novel SOCS-box regulates assembly of the HIV-1 Vif-Cul5 complex that promotes APOBEC3G degradation.
15574592|a|HIV-1 Vif (viral infectivity factor) protein overcomes the antiviral activity of the DNA deaminase APOBEC3G by targeting it for proteasomal degradation. We report here that Vif targets APOBEC3G for degradation by forming an SCF-like E3 ubiquitin ligase containing Cullin 5 and Elongins B and C (Cul5-EloB-EloC) through a novel SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling)-box that binds EloC. Vif binding to EloC is negatively regulated by serine phosphorylation in the BC-box motif of the SOCS-box. Vif ubiquitination is promoted by Cul5 in vitro and in vivo, and requires an intact SOCS-box. Thus, autoubiquitination of Vif occurs within the assembled Vif-Cul5 complex, analogous to F-box proteins that are autoubiquitinated within their SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complex. These findings suggest mechanisms that regulate the assembly and activity of Cul5 E3 complexes through phosphorylation or autoubiquitination of the SOCS-box protein, and identify interactions between Vif and host cell proteins that may be therapeutic targets.

17011021|t|Comparison between the effects of aging and hyperoxia on glutathione redox state and protein mixed disulfides in Drosophila melanogaster.
17011021|a|The main purpose of this study was to determine whether experimental enhancement of oxidative stress by exposure to hyperoxia is an appropriate model for the acceleration of the normal aging process or for establishing a causal association between oxidative stress and aging. Insect tissues are directly exposed to ambient air via the tracheolar invaginations and are thus highly susceptible to oxidative stress under hyperoxic conditions. Amounts of glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and protein mixed disulfides (PrSSG) were compared under normoxic and 100% ambient oxygen in males of two different strains of Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R (WT) and y w strains). The reason for using two different strains was to preclude the effects of genetic background and to determine whether variations in longevity of the two strains are associated with resistance to oxidative stress. Amounts of GSSG and PrSSG increased, whereas GSH:GSSG ratios declined as a function of age in both strains. Under hyperoxia, y w flies did not exhibit an increase in GSSG amount or a decline in GSH:GSSG ratio, whereas WT flies showed a decline in GSH:GSSG ratio only during the later part of hyperoxic exposure. In neither strain there was a progressive increase in PrSSG amount under hyperoxia. Results indicate that hyperoxia (100% oxygen) neither reproduces nor accelerates the pattern of alterations in glutathione redox state and PrSSG content observed during aging under normoxic conditions, although some other indicators of oxidative stress may be affected.

17300923|t|Lipid abnormalities in succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh5a1-/-) deficient mouse brain provide additional evidence for myelin alterations.
17300923|a|Earlier work from our laboratory provided evidence for myelin abnormalities (decreased quantities of proteins associated with myelin compaction, decreased sheath thickness) in cortex and hippocampus of Aldh5a1(-/-) mice, which have a complete ablation of the succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase protein [E.A. Donarum, D.A. Stephan, K. Larkin, E.J. Murphy, M. Gupta, H. Senephansiri, R.C. Switzer, P.L. Pearl, O.C. Snead, C. Jakobs, K.M. Gibson, Expression profiling reveals multiple myelin alterations in murine succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 29 (2006) 143-156]. In the current report, we have extended these findings via comprehensive analysis of brain phospholipid fractions, including quantitation of fatty acids in individual phospholipid subclasses and estimation of hexose-ceramide in Aldh5a1(-/-) brain. In comparison to wild-type littermates (Aldh5a1(+/+)), we detected a 20% reduction in the ethanolamine glycerophospholipid content of Aldh5a1(-/-)mice, while other brain phospholipids (choline glycerophospholipid, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol) were within normal limits. Analysis of individual fatty acids in each of these fractions revealed consistent alterations in n-3 fatty acids, primarily increased 22:6n-3 levels (docosahexaenoic acid; DHA). In the phosphatidyl serine fraction there were marked increases in the proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids with corresponding decreases of monounsaturated fatty acids. Interestingly, the levels of hexose-ceramide (glucosyl- and galactosylceramide, principal myelin cerebrosides) were decreased in Aldh5a1(-/-) brain tissue (one-tailed t test, p=0.0449). The current results suggest that lipid and myelin abnormalities in this animal may contribute to the pathophysiology.

17255031|t|Prehistoric human impact on rainforest biodiversity in highland New Guinea.
17255031|a|In the highlands of New Guinea, the development of agriculture as an indigenous innovation during the Early Holocene is considered to have resulted in rapid loss of forest cover, a decrease in forest biodiversity and increased land degradation over thousands of years. But how important is human activity in shaping the diversity of vegetation communities over millennial time-scales? An evaluation of the change in biodiversity of forest habitats through the Late Glacial transition to the present in five palaeoecological sites from highland valleys, where intensive agriculture is practised today, is presented. A detailed analysis of the longest and most continuous record from Papua New Guinea is also presented using available biodiversity indices (palynological richness and biodiversity indicator taxa) as a means of identifying changes in diversity. The analysis shows that the collapse of key forest habitats in the highland valleys is evident during the Mid - Late Holocene. These changes are best explained by the adoption of new land management practices and altered disturbance regimes associated with agricultural activity, though climate change may also play a role. The implications of these findings for ecosystem conservation and sustainability of agriculture in New Guinea are discussed.

18164577|t|Effects of mGlu1-receptor blockade on ethanol self-administration in inbred alcohol-preferring rats.
18164577|a|The Group I family of metabotropic glutamate receptors includes subtype 1 (mGlu1) and subtype 5 (mGlu5) receptors. This family of receptors has generated interest as potential targets for different areas of therapeutic development, including intervention for alcohol and drug abuse. Most of this interest is driven by findings showing involvement of mGlu5 receptors in the regulation of drug self-administration; however, studies examining the role of mGlu1 receptors in drug self-administration are limited. The purpose of this work was to examine the role of mGlu1-receptor antagonism in the maintenance of ethanol self-administration and the self-administration of an alternate nondrug reward, sucrose. Male alcohol-preferring inbred rats were trained to self-administer ethanol (15% vol/vol) versus water on a concurrent schedule of reinforcement, and the effect of the mGlu1-receptor antagonist JNJ16259685 (0.1-1.0mg/kg intraperitoneal [IP]) was evaluated on self-administration. The rats were then trained to self-administer sucrose (0.4% wt/vol) versus water, and the same dose range of JNJ16259685 was tested. Locomotor activity was tested in a separate assessment to evaluate potential nonspecific motor effects of the antagonist. Ethanol self-administration was dose dependently reduced by JNJ16259685. This reduction was likely due to a motor impairment as the lowest effective dose (0.1mg/kg) significantly reduced locomotor behavior. Sucrose self-administration was reduced by the highest JNJ16259685 dose (1.0mg/kg), and this reduction was also likely due to a motor impairment. Interestingly, ethanol self-administration was more sensitive to mGlu1-receptor antagonism than sucrose self-administration as lower JNJ16259685 doses reduced ethanol-reinforced responding and motor behavior. Together, these results suggest that mGlu1 receptors do not play a specific role in modulating ethanol self-administration or the self-administration of an alternate nondrug reward (i.e., sucrose).

16606347|t|A fluorescence assay for rapid detection of ligand binding affinity to HIV-1 gp41.
16606347|a|The fusion-active conformation of the envelope protein gp41 of HIV-1 consists of an N-terminal trimeric alpha-helical coiled-coil domain and three anti-parallel C-terminal helices that fold down the grooves of the coiled-coil to form a six-helix bundle. Disruption of the six-helix bundle is considered to be a key component of an effective non-peptide fusion inhibitor. In the current study, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiment for the detection of inhibitor binding to the gp41 N-peptide coiled-coil of HIV-1 was performed, utilizing peptide inhibitors derived from the gp41 C-terminal helical region. The FRET acceptor is a 31-residue N-peptide containing a known deep hydrophobic pocket, stabilized into a trimer by ferrous ion ligation. The FRET donor is a 16-18-residue fluorophore-labeled C-peptide, designed to test the specificity of the N-C interaction. Low microM dissociation constants were observed, correlated to the correct sequence and helical propensity of the C-peptides. Competitive inhibition was demonstrated using the assay, allowing for rank ordering of peptide inhibitors according to their affinity in the 1-20 microM range. The assay was conducted by measuring fluorescence intensity in 384-well plates. The rapid detection of inhibitor binding may permit identification of novel drug classes from a library.

17431400|t|Embryonic and fetal beta-globin gene repression by the orphan nuclear receptors, TR2 and TR4.
17431400|a|The TR2 and TR4 orphan nuclear receptors comprise the DNA-binding core of direct repeat erythroid definitive, a protein complex that binds to direct repeat elements in the embryonic and fetal beta-type globin gene promoters. Silencing of both the embryonic and fetal beta-type globin genes is delayed in definitive erythroid cells of Tr2 and Tr4 null mutant mice, whereas in transgenic mice that express dominant-negative TR4 (dnTR4), human embryonic epsilon-globin is activated in primitive and definitive erythroid cells. In contrast, human fetal gamma-globin is activated by dnTR4 only in definitive, but not in primitive, erythroid cells, implicating TR2/TR4 as a stage-selective repressor. Forced expression of wild-type TR2 and TR4 leads to precocious repression of epsilon-globin, but in contrast to induction of gamma-globin in definitive erythroid cells. These temporally specific, gene-selective alterations in epsilon- and gamma-globin gene expression by gain and loss of TR2/TR4 function provide the first genetic evidence for a role for these nuclear receptors in sequential, gene-autonomous silencing of the epsilon- and gamma-globin genes during development, and suggest that their differential utilization controls stage-specific repression of the human epsilon- and gamma-globin genes.

17460035|t|Nitric oxide mediates prostaglandins' deleterious effect on lipopolysaccharide-triggered murine fetal resorption.
17460035|a|Genital tract bacterial infections could induce abortion and are some of the most common complications of pregnancy; however, the mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the role of prostaglandins (PGs) in the mechanism of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pregnancy loss in a mouse model, and we hypothesized that PGs might play a central role in this action. LPS increased PG production in the uterus and decidua from early pregnant mice and stimulated cyclooxygenase (COX)-II mRNA and protein expression in the decidua but not in the uterus. We also observed that COX inhibitors prevented embryonic resorption (ER). To study the possible interaction between nitric oxide (NO) and PGs, we administered aminoguanidine, an inducible NO synthase inhibitor. NO inhibited basal PGE and PGF(2alpha) production in the decidua but activated their uterine synthesis and COX-II mRNA expression under septic conditions. A NO donor (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) produced 100% ER and increased PG levels in the uterus and decidua. LPS-stimulated protein nitration was higher in the uterus than in the decidua. Quercetin, a peroxynitrite scavenger, did not reverse LPS-induced ER. Our results suggest that in a model of septic abortion characterized by increased PG levels, NO might nitrate and thus inhibit COX catalytic activity. ER prevention by COX inhibitors adds a possible clinical application to early pregnancy complications due to infections.

15282542|t|ATR functions as a gene dosage-dependent tumor suppressor on a mismatch repair-deficient background.
15282542|a|The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and rad3-related (ATR) kinase orchestrates cellular responses to DNA damage and replication stress. Complete loss of ATR function leads to chromosomal instability and cell death. However, heterozygous ATR mutations are found in human cancers with microsatellite instability, suggesting that ATR haploinsufficiency contributes to tumorigenesis. To test this possibility, we generated human cell line and mouse model systems in which a single ATR allele was inactivated on a mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient background. Monoallelic ATR gene targeting in MLH1-deficient HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells resulted in hypersensitivity to genotoxic stress accompanied by dramatic increases in fragile site instability, and chromosomal amplifications and rearrangements. The ATR(+/-) HCT 116 cells also displayed compromised activation of Chk1, an important downstream target for ATR. In complementary studies, we demonstrated that mice bearing the same Atr(+/-)/Mlh1(-/-) genotype were highly prone to both embryonic lethality and early tumor development. These results demonstrate that MMR proteins and ATR functionally interact during the cellular response to genotoxic stress, and that ATR serves as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in MMR-deficient cells.

16606847|t|Global traffic and disease vector dispersal.
16606847|a|The expansion of global air travel and seaborne trade overcomes geographic barriers to insect disease vectors, enabling them to move great distances in short periods of time. Here we apply a coupled human-environment framework to describe the historical spread of Aedes albopictus, a competent mosquito vector of 22 arboviruses in the laboratory. We contrast this dispersal with the relatively unchanged distribution of Anopheles gambiae and examine possible future movements of this malaria vector. We use a comprehensive database of international ship and aircraft traffic movements, combined with climatic information, to remap the global transportation network in terms of disease vector suitability and accessibility. The expansion of the range of Ae. albopictus proved to be surprisingly predictable using this combination of climate and traffic data. Traffic volumes were more than twice as high on shipping routes running from the historical distribution of Ae. albopictus to ports where it has established in comparison with routes to climatically similar ports where it has yet to invade. In contrast, An. gambiae has rarely spread from Africa, which we suggest is partly due to the low volume of sea traffic from the continent and, until very recently, a European destination for most flights.

18262585|t|Synthesis and properties of the red chromophore of the green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede and its analogs.
18262585|a|Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and homologous proteins possess a unique pathway of chromophore formation based on autocatalytic modification of their own amino acid residues. Green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede carries His-Tyr-Gly chromophore-forming triad. Here, we describe synthesis of Kaede red chromophore (2-[(1E)-2-(5-imidazolyl)ethenyl]-4-(p-hydroxybenzylidene)-5-imidazolone) and its analogs that can be potentially formed by natural amino acid residues. Chromophores corresponding to the following tripeptides were obtained: His-Tyr-Gly, Trp-Tyr-Gly, Phe-Trp-Gly, Tyr-Trp-Gly, Asn-Tyr-Gly, Phe-Tyr-Gly, and Tyr-Tyr-Gly. In basic conditions they fluoresced red with relatively high quantum yield (up to 0.017 for Trp-derived compounds). The most red-shifted absorption peak at 595nm was found for the chromophore Trp-Tyr-Gly in basic DMSO. Surprisingly, in basic DMF non-aromatic Asn-derived chromophore Asn-Tyr-Gly demonstrated the most red-shifted emission maximum at 642 nm. Thus, Asn residue may be a promising substituent, which can potentially diversify posttranslational chemistry in GFP-like proteins.

16325377|t|Magnocellular contributions to impaired motion processing in schizophrenia.
16325377|a|Patients with schizophrenia show impairments in motion processing, along with deficits in lower level processing primarily involving the magnocellular visual pathway. The present study investigates potential magnocellular contributions to impaired motion processing in schizophrenia using a combined neurophysiological and behavioral approach. As compared to prior motion studies in schizophrenia, thresholds were determined for both incoherent and coherent visual motion. In this study, velocity discrimination thresholds were measured for schizophrenia patients (n=14) and age-matched normal control subjects (n=16) using a staircase procedure. Early visual processing was evaluated using steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEP), with stimuli biased toward activation of either the magnocellular or parvocellular visual pathways through luminance contrast manipulation. Patients with schizophrenia showed poor velocity discrimination for both incoherent and coherent motion, with no significant group x task interaction. Further, when coherent motion performance was measured at individually determined incoherent motion thresholds, accuracy levels for patients were similar to controls, also indicating similarity of deficit for incoherent vs. coherent motion discrimination. Impairments in velocity discrimination correlated significantly with reduced amplitude of ssVEP elicited by magnocellular -- but not parvocellular -- selective stimuli. This study demonstrates that deficits in motion processing in schizophrenia are significantly related to reduced activation of the magnocellular visual system. Further, this study supports and extends prior reports of impaired motion processing in schizophrenia, and indicates significant bottom-up contributions to higher-order cognitive impairments.

19376974|t|Roles for endocytic trafficking and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha in hepatitis C virus replication.
19376974|a|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) reorganizes cellular membranes to establish sites of replication. The required host pathways and the mechanism of cellular membrane reorganization are poorly characterized. Therefore, we interrogated a customized small interfering RNA (siRNA) library that targets 140 host membrane-trafficking genes to identify genes required for both HCV subgenomic replication and infectious virus production. We identified 7 host cofactors of viral replication, including Cdc42 and Rock2 (actin polymerization), EEA1 and Rab5A (early endosomes), Rab7L1, and PI3-kinase C2gamma and PI4-kinase IIIalpha (phospholipid metabolism). Studies of drug inhibitors indicate actin polymerization and phospholipid kinase activity are required for HCV replication. We found extensive co-localization of the HCV replicase markers NS5A and double-stranded RNA with Rab5A and partial co-localization with Rab7L1. PI4K-IIIalpha co-localized with NS5A and double-stranded RNA in addition to being present in detergent-resistant membranes containing NS5A. In a comparison of type II and type III PI4-kinases, PI4Ks were not required for HCV entry, and only PI4K-IIIalpha was required for HCV replication. Although PI4K-IIIalpha siRNAs decreased HCV replication and virus production by almost 100%, they had no effect on initial HCV RNA translation, suggesting that PI4K-IIIalpha functions at a posttranslational stage. Electron microscopy identified the presence of membranous webs, which are thought to be the site of HCV replication, in HCV-infected cells. Pretreatment with PI4K-IIIalpha siRNAs greatly reduced the accumulation of these membranous web structures in HCV-infected cells. We propose that PI4K-IIIalpha plays an essential role in membrane alterations leading to the formation of HCV replication complexes.

17026729|t|Morbidity and mortality conference, grand rounds, and the ACGME's core competencies.
17026729|a|Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) Conferences are an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandated educational series that occur regularly at all institutions that have residency training programs. The potential for learning from medical errors, complications, and unanticipated outcomes is immense--provided that the focus is on education, as opposed to culpability. The education innovation described in this manuscript is the manner in which we have used the ACGME Outcome Project's 6 core competencies as the structure upon which the cases discussed at our M&M conference are framed. When presented at grand rounds in a novel format, M&M conference has not only maintained support for the quality improvement efforts in the Department, but has served to improve the educational impact of the conference.

17120196|t|Augmented suppression of androgen receptor signaling by a combination of alpha-tocopheryl succinate and methylseleninic acid.
17120196|a|BACKGROUND: Previous reports showed that alpha-tocopheryl succinate (alphaTS) and methylseleninic acid (MSA) independently reduce the abundance of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells. The response to MSA happens quickly, whereas the response to alphaTS takes much longer. The present study was designed to investigate whether a combination of alphaTS and MSA would produce an additive or a greater than additive effect in suppressing AR level, AR transactivation, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). METHODS: LNCaP cells were treated with alphaTS alone for 31 hours, MSA alone for 3 hours, or alphaTS first for 28 hours and alphaTS/MSA together for the last 3 hours. AR and PSA mRNA levels were quantitated by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). AR transactivation was determined by the ARE-luciferase reporter assay. Both cellular and secretory PSA was also measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. RESULTS: Different doses of alphaTS were evaluated in combination with MSA. Some striking results are highlighted below for alphaTS alone, MSA alone, or alphaTS/MSA (presented in that order). AR mRNA level was depressed by 0%, 20%, or 60%, respectively; AR transactivation was inhibited by 35%, 10%, or 60%, respectively; whereas the PSA mRNA level was decreased by 40%, 60%, or 90%, respectively. Interestingly, secretory PSA was consistently reduced to a greater extent than cellular PSA. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of alphaTS/MSA produced a greater than additive effect in suppressing AR signaling compared with the single agent. Decreased AR abundance is a major factor, but not necessarily the sole factor, in diminishing the transcriptional activity of AR by alphaTS or MSA.

15775965|t|Bacterial DNA segregation dynamics mediated by the polymerizing protein ParF.
15775965|a|Prokaryotic DNA segregation most commonly involves members of the Walker-type ParA superfamily. Here we show that the ParF partition protein specified by the TP228 plasmid is a ParA ATPase that assembles into extensive filaments in vitro. Polymerization is potentiated by ATP binding and does not require nucleotide hydrolysis. Analysis of mutations in conserved residues of the Walker A motif established a functional coupling between filament dynamics and DNA partitioning. The partner partition protein ParG plays two separable roles in the ParF polymerization process. ParF is unrelated to prokaryotic polymerizing proteins of the actin or tubulin families, but is a homologue of the MinD cell division protein, which also assembles into filaments. The ultrastructures of the ParF and MinD polymers are remarkably similar. This points to an evolutionary parallel between DNA segregation and cytokinesis in prokaryotic cells, and reveals a potential molecular mechanism for plasmid and chromosome segregation mediated by the ubiquitous ParA-type proteins.

17251141|t|Individual and gender fingerprints in human body odour.
17251141|a|Individuals are thought to have their own distinctive scent, analogous to a signature or fingerprint. To test this idea, we collected axillary sweat, urine and saliva from 197 adults from a village in the Austrian Alps, taking five sweat samples per subject over 10 weeks using a novel skin sampling device. We analysed samples using stir bar sorptive extraction in connection with thermal desorption gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and then we statistically analysed the chromatographic profiles using pattern recognition techniques. We found more volatile compounds in axillary sweat than in urine or saliva, and among these we found 373 peaks that were consistent over time (detected in four out of five samples per individual). Among these candidate compounds, we found individually distinct and reproducible GC-MS fingerprints, a reproducible difference between the sexes, and we identified the chemical structures of 44 individual and 12 gender-specific volatile compounds. These individual compounds provide candidates for major histocompatibility complex and other genetically determined odours. This is the first study on human axillary odour to sample a large number of subjects, and our findings are relevant to understanding the chemical nature of human odour, and efforts to design electronic sensors (e-nose) for biometric fingerprinting and disease diagnoses.

15070742|t|A transgenic mouse model of metastatic carcinoma involving transdifferentiation of a gastric epithelial lineage progenitor to a neuroendocrine phenotype.
15070742|a|Human neuroendocrine cancers (NECs) arise in various endoderm-derived epithelia, have diverse morphologic features, exhibit a wide range of growth phenotypes, and generally have obscure cellular origins and ill-defined molecular mediators of initiation and progression. We describe a transgenic mouse model of metastatic gastric cancer initiated by expressing simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (SV40 TAg), under control of regulatory elements from the mouse Atp4b gene, in the progenitors of acid-producing parietal cells. Parietal cells normally do not express endocrine or neural features, and Atp4b-Cre bitransgenic mice with a Cre reporter confirmed that the Atp4b regulatory elements are not active in gastric enteroendocrine cells. GeneChip analyses were performed on laser capture microdissected SV40 TAg-expressing cells in preinvasive foci and invasive tumors. Genes that distinguish invasive from preinvasive cells were then hierarchically clustered with DNA microarray datasets obtained from human lung and gastric cancers. The results, combined with immunohistochemical and electron microscopy studies of Apt4b-SV40 TAg stomachs, revealed that progression to invasion was associated with transdifferentiation of parietal cell progenitors to a neuroendocrine phenotype, and that invasive cells shared molecular features with NECs arising in the human pulmonary epithelium, including transcription factors that normally regulate differentiation of various endocrine lineages and maintain neural progenitors in an undifferentiated state. The 399 mouse genes identified as regulated during acquisition of an invasive phenotype and concomitant neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, plus their human orthologs associated with lung NECs, provide a foundation for molecular classification of NECs arising in other tissues and for genetic tests of the molecular mechanisms underlying NEC pathogenesis.

16603630|t|Classic flea-borne transmission does not drive plague epizootics in prairie dogs.
16603630|a|We lack a clear understanding of the enzootic maintenance of the bacterium (Yersinia pestis) that causes plague and the sporadic epizootics that occur in its natural rodent hosts. A key to elucidating these epidemiological dynamics is determining the dominant transmission routes of plague. Plague can be acquired from the bites of infectious fleas (which is generally considered to occur via a blocked flea vector), inhalation of infectious respiratory droplets, or contact with a short-term infectious reservoir. We present results from a plague modeling approach that includes transmission from all three sources of infection simultaneously and uses sensitivity analysis to determine their relative importance. Our model is completely parameterized by using data from the literature and our own field studies of plague in the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). Results of the model are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with independent data from our field sites. Although infectious fleas might be an important source of infection and transmission via blocked fleas is a dominant paradigm in the literature, our model clearly predicts that this form of transmission cannot drive epizootics in prairie dogs. Rather, a short-term reservoir is required for epizootic dynamics. Several short-term reservoirs have the potential to affect the prairie dog system. Our model predictions of the residence time of the short-term reservoir suggest that other small mammals, infectious prairie dog carcasses, fleas that transmit plague without blockage of the digestive tract, or some combination of these three are the most likely of the candidate infectious reservoirs.

18334255|t|Alanine scanning mutagenesis of anti-TRAP (AT) reveals residues involved in binding to TRAP.
18334255|a|The trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) regulates expression of the tryptophan biosynthetic (trp) genes in response to changes in intracellular levels of free l-tryptophan in many Gram-positive bacteria. When activated by binding tryptophan, TRAP binds to the mRNAs of several genes involved in tryptophan metabolism, and down-regulates transcription or translation of these genes. Anti-TRAP (AT) is an antagonist of TRAP that binds to tryptophan-activated TRAP and prevents it from binding to its RNA targets, and thereby up-regulates trp gene expression. The crystal structure shows that AT is a cone-shaped trimer (AT(3)) with the N-terminal residues of the three subunits assembled at the apex of the cone and that these trimers can further assemble into a dodecameric (AT(12)) structure. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis we found four residues, all located on the "top" region of AT(3), that are essential for binding to TRAP. Fluorescent labeling experiments further suggest that the top region of AT is in close juxtaposition to TRAP in the AT-TRAP complex. In vivo studies confirmed the importance of these residues on the top of AT in regulating TRAP mediated gene regulation.

15071503|t|HIF-1alpha induces cell cycle arrest by functionally counteracting Myc.
15071503|a|Hypoxia induces angiogenesis and glycolysis for cell growth and survival, and also leads to growth arrest and apoptosis. HIF-1alpha, a basic helix-loop-helix PAS transcription factor, acts as a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis by upregulating various genes under low oxygen tension. Although genetic studies have indicated the requirement of HIF-1alpha for hypoxia-induced growth arrest and activation of p21(cip1), a key cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor controlling cell cycle checkpoint, the mechanism underlying p21(cip1) activation has been elusive. Here we demonstrate that HIF-1alpha, even in the absence of hypoxic signal, induces cell cycle arrest by functionally counteracting Myc, thereby derepressing p21(cip1). The HIF-1alpha antagonism is mediated by displacing Myc binding from p21(cip1) promoter. Neither HIF-1alpha transcriptional activity nor its DNA binding is essential for cell cycle arrest, indicating a divergent role for HIF-1alpha. In keeping with its antagonism of Myc, HIF-1alpha also downregulates Myc-activated genes such as hTERT and BRCA1. Hence, we propose that Myc is an integral part of a novel HIF-1alpha pathway, which regulates a distinct group of Myc target genes in response to hypoxia.

17437993|t|Pharmacologic disruption of Polycomb-repressive complex 2-mediated gene repression selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells.
17437993|a|Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated histone methylation plays an important role in aberrant cancer gene silencing and is a potential target for cancer therapy. Here we show that S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) induces efficient apoptotic cell death in cancer cells but not in normal cells. We found that DZNep effectively depleted cellular levels of PRC2 components EZH2, SUZ12, and EED and inhibited associated histone H3 Lys 27 methylation (but not H3 Lys 9 methylation). By integrating RNA interference (RNAi), genome-wide expression analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies, we have identified a prominent set of genes selectively repressed by PRC2 in breast cancer that can be reactivated by DZNep. We further demonstrate that the preferential reactivation of a set of these genes by DZNep, including a novel apoptosis affector, FBXO32, contributes to DZNep-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Our results demonstrate the unique feature of DZNep as a novel chromatin remodeling compound and suggest that pharmacologic reversal of PRC2-mediated gene repression by DZNep may constitute a novel approach for cancer therapy.

15057281|t|Functional roles for evolutionarily conserved Spt4p at centromeres and heterochromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
15057281|a|The kinetochore (centromeric DNA and associated proteins) mediates the attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle apparatus and is required for faithful chromosome transmission. We established that evolutionarily conserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPT4, previously identified in genetic screens for defects in chromosome transmission fidelity (ctf), encodes a new structural component of specialized chromatin at kinetochores and heterochromatic loci, with roles in kinetochore function and gene silencing. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP), we determined that kinetochore proteins Ndc10p, Cac1p, and Hir1p are required for the association of Spt4p to centromeric (CEN) loci. Absence of functional Spt4p leads to altered chromatin structure at the CEN DNA and mislocalization of the mammalian CENP-A homolog Cse4p to noncentromeric loci. Spt4p associates with telomeres (TEL) and HMRa loci in a Sir3p-dependent manner and is required for transcriptional gene silencing. We show that a human homolog of SPT4 (HsSPT4) complements Scspt4-silencing defects and associates with ScCEN DNA in an Ndc10p-dependent manner. Our results highlight the evolutionary conservation of pathways required for genome stability in yeast and humans.

17460048|t|Protein-induced, previously unidentified twin form of calcite.
17460048|a|Using single-crystal x-ray diffraction, we found a formerly unknown twin form in calcite crystals grown from solution to which a mollusc shell-derived 17-kDa protein, Caspartin, was added. This intracrystalline protein was extracted from the calcitic prisms of the Pinna nobilis shells. The observed twin form is characterized by the twinning plane of the (108)-type, which is in addition to the known four twin laws of calcite identified during 150 years of investigations. The established twin forms in calcite have twinning planes of the (001)-, (012)-, (104)-, and (018)-types. Our discovery provides additional evidence on the crucial role of biological macromolecules in biomineralization.

15931284|t|Immune deficiency in CHARGE association.
15931284|a|CHARGE association is the sporadic, non-random concurrence of Coloboma of the eye, Heart anomalies, choanal Atresia, Retardation of growth and development, Genitourinary anomalies, Ear anomalies and deafness (CHARGE association). Other abnormalities have also been reported in small numbers of patients with CHARGE association. The molecular basis of the CHARGE association is not clear. The spectrum of CHARGE association anomalies is wide and includes multiple systems. CHARGE association shares features with DiGeorge sequence, but no specific immune abnormalities are identified with the CHARGE association. The present study reports immune defects observed in three patients with CHARGE association. All patients presented with frequent upper and lower respiratory infections. The underlying immune abnormalities differ: one patient has impaired T-cell proliferation and poor antibody response to polysaccharide (pneumococcal) antigens; another has T-cell lymphopenia; and the third has a mild IgG2 subclass deficiency. Their course has so far been benign and they are all managed with prophylactic antibiotics. Although no single abnormality of the immune system is recognized in these patients, immune deficiency is considered among the occasional components of the CHARGE association.

19805168|t|Targeting proteins to distinct subcellular compartments reveals unique requirements for MHC class I and II presentation.
19805168|a|Peptides derived from exogenous proteins are presented by both MHC class I and II. Despite extensive study, the features of the endocytic pathway that mediate cross-presentation of exogenous antigens on MHC class I are not entirely understood and difficult to generalize to all proteins. Here, we used dendritic cells and macrophages to examine MHC class I and II presentation of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) in different forms, soluble and liposome encapsulated. Soluble HEL or HEL targeted to a late endosomal compartment only allowed for MHC class II presentation, in a process that was blocked by chloroquine and a cathepsin S (CatS) inhibitor; brefeldin A (BFA) also blocked presentation, indicating a requirement for nascent MHC class II. In contrast, liposome-encapsulated HEL targeted to early endosomes entered the MHC class I and II presentation pathways. Cross-presentation of HEL in early endosomal liposomes had several unique features: it was markedly increased by BFA and by blockade of the proteasome or CatS activity, it occurred independently of the transporter associated with antigen processing but required an MHC class I surface-stabilizing peptide, and it was inhibited by chloroquine. Remarkably, chloroquine facilitated MHC class I cross-presentation of soluble HEL and HEL in late endosomal liposomes. Altogether, MHC class I and II presentation of HEL occurred through pathways having distinct molecular and proteolytic requirements. Moreover, MHC class I sampled antigenic peptides from various points along the endocytic route.

16949563|t|Cellular electroporation induces dedifferentiation in intact newt limbs.
16949563|a|Newts have the remarkable ability to regenerate lost appendages including their forelimbs, hindlimbs, and tails. Following amputation of an appendage, the wound is rapidly closed by the migration of epithelial cells from the proximal epidermis. Internal cells just proximal to the amputation plane begin to dedifferentiate to form a pool of proliferating progenitor cells known as the regeneration blastema. We show that dedifferentiation of internal appendage cells can be initiated in the absence of amputation by applying an electric field sufficient to induce cellular electroporation, but not necrosis or apoptosis. The time course for dedifferentiation following electroporation is similar to that observed following amputation with evidence of dedifferentiation beginning at about 5 days postelectroporation and continuing for 2 to 3 weeks. Microarray analyses, real-time RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization show that changes in early gene expression are similar following amputation or electroporation. We conclude that the application of an electric field sufficient to induce transient electroporation of cell membranes induces a dedifferentiation response that is virtually indistinguishable from the response that occurs following amputation of newt appendages. This discovery allows dedifferentiation to be studied in the absence of wound healing and may aid in identifying genes required for cellular plasticity.

19058317|t|Complete hepatocellular carcinoma necrosis following sequential porto-arterial embolization.
19058317|a|Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not eligible for curative treatment, which is resection or transplantation. Two recent series have emphasized the potential benefits of preoperative arterio-portal embolization prior to surgical resection of such tumours. This preoperative strategy offers a better disease free survival rate and a higher rate of total tumor necrosis. In case of non resectable HCC it is now widely accepted that transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) leads to a better survival when compared to conservative treatment. Thus, the question remains whether combined portal vein embolization (PVE) may enhance the proven efficiency of TACE in patients with unresectable HCC. We herein report the case of a 56-year-old cirrhotic woman with a voluminous HCC unsuitable for surgical resection. Yet, complete tumour necrosis and prolonged survival could be achieved after a combined porto-arterial embolization. This case emphasizes the potential synergistic effect of a combined arterio-portal embolization and the hypothetical survival benefit of such a procedure, in selected patients, with HCC not suitable for surgery or local ablative therapy.

15057280|t|Methionine sulfoxide reductases protect Ffh from oxidative damages in Escherichia coli.
15057280|a|In proteins, methionine residues are primary targets for oxidation. Methionine oxidation is reversed by methionine sulfoxide reductases A and B, a class of highly conserved enzymes. Ffh protein, a component of the ubiquitous signal recognition particle, contains a methionine-rich domain, interacting with a small 4.5S RNA. In vitro analyses reported here show that: (i) oxidized Ffh is unable to bind 4.5S RNA, (ii) oxidized Ffh contains methionine sulfoxide residues, (iii) oxidized Ffh is a substrate for MsrA and MsrB enzymes; and (iv) MsrA/B repairing activities allow oxidized Ffh to recover 4.5S RNA-binding abilities. In vivo analyses reveal that: (i) Ffh synthesized in the msrA msrB mutant contains methionine sulfoxide residues and is unstable, (ii) msrA msrB mutant requires high levels of Ffh synthesis for growth and (iii) msrA msrB mutation leads to defects in Ffh-dependent targeting of MalF. We conclude that MsrA and MsrB are required to repair Ffh oxidized by reactive oxygen species produced by aerobic metabolism, establishing an as-yet undescribed link between protein targeting and oxidation.

18437002|t|Identification of PSEN1 and APP gene mutations in Korean patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
18437002|a|Although mutations in three genes, amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), have been identified as genetic causes of early-onset Alzheimer s disease (EOAD), there has been a single report on a PSEN1 mutation in Koreans. In the present study, we performed a genetic analysis of six Korean patients with EOAD. Direct sequencing analysis of the APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes revealed two different mutations of the PSEN1 gene (G206S and M233T) and one mutation of the APP gene (V715M) in three patients with age-at-onset of 34, 35, and 42 yr, respectively. In addition, two patients with age-at-onset of 55 and 62 yr, respectively, were homozygous for APOE epsilon 4 allele. One woman had no genetic alterations. These findings suggest that PSEN1 and APP gene mutations may not be uncommon in Korean patients with EOAD and that genetic analysis should be provided to EOAD patients not only for the identification of their genetic causes but also for the appropriate genetic counseling.

15546993|t|Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-S, a sperm-specific glycolytic enzyme, is required for sperm motility and male fertility.
15546993|a|Although glycolysis is highly conserved, it is remarkable that several unique isozymes in this central metabolic pathway are found in mammalian sperm. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-S (GAPDS) is the product of a mouse gene expressed only during spermatogenesis and, like its human ortholog (GAPD2), is the sole GAPDH isozyme in sperm. It is tightly bound to the fibrous sheath, a cytoskeletal structure that extends most of the length of the sperm flagellum. We disrupted Gapds expression by gene targeting to selectively block sperm glycolysis and assess its relative importance for in vivo sperm function. Gapds(-/-) males were infertile and had profound defects in sperm motility, exhibiting sluggish movement without forward progression. Although mitochondrial oxygen consumption was unchanged, sperm from Gapds(-/-) mice had ATP levels that were only 10.4% of those in sperm from WT mice. These results imply that most of the energy required for sperm motility is generated by glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, the critical role of glycolysis in sperm and its dependence on this sperm-specific enzyme suggest that GAPDS is a potential contraceptive target, and that mutations or environmental agents that disrupt its activity could lead to male infertility.

16060859|t|A computational model of mitochondrial AZT metabolism.
16060859|a|The mechanisms of the mitochondrial toxicity of AZT (azidothymidine; zidovudine) are not clear. The two main contenders are the incorporation of phosphorylated AZT into the mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) and the competitive inhibition of natural deoxynucleotide metabolism. We have built a computational model of AZT metabolism in mitochondria in order to better understand these toxicity mechanisms. The model includes the transport of non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of AZT into mitochondria, phosphorylation, and incorporation into mtDNA. The model also includes the mitochondrial metabolism of the natural deoxynucleotides. We define three simulated cell types, i.e. rapidly dividing, slowly dividing and postmitotic cells. Our standard simulation indicates that incorporation of AZT into mtDNA is highest in rapidly dividing cells because of the higher mitochondrial AZTTP (3'-azidothymidine-5'-triphosphate)/dTTP ratio in this cell type. However, under these standard conditions the rate of incorporation into mtDNA is too low to be a major cause of toxicity. These simulations relied on the assumption that phosphorylated AZT is transported with the same kinetics as phosphorylated thymidine. In simulations with mitochondria set to have a limited ability to transport phosphorylated AZT, AZTTP accumulates to toxic levels in the mitochondria of postmitotic cells, while low levels are maintained in mitochondria from rapidly dividing cells. This result is more consistent with the tissue toxicities observed in patients. Our model also predicts that inhibition by AZT of mitochondrial deoxycytidine phosphorylation by thymidine kinase 2 may contribute to the mitochondrial toxicity, since in simulations using a typical peak plasma AZT level the mtDNA replication rate is decreased by 30% in postmitotic cell simulations.

16996534|t|The effects of carbon dioxide anesthesia and anoxia on rapid cold-hardening and chill coma recovery in Drosophila melanogaster.
16996534|a|Carbon dioxide gas is used as an insect anesthetic in many laboratories, despite recent studies which have shown that CO(2) can alter behavior and fitness. We examine the effects of CO(2) and anoxia (N(2)) on cold tolerance, measuring the rapid cold-hardening (RCH) response and chill coma recovery in Drosophila melanogaster. Short exposures to CO(2) or N(2) do not significantly affect RCH, but 60 min of exposure negates RCH. Exposure to CO(2) anesthesia increases chill coma recovery time, but this effect disappears if the flies are given 90 min recovery in air before chill coma induction. Flies treated with N(2) show a similar pattern, but require significantly longer chill coma recovery times even after 90 min of recovery from anoxia. Our results suggest that CO(2) anesthesia is an acceptable way to manipulate flies before cold tolerance experiments (when using RCH or chill coma recovery as a measure), provided exposure duration is minimized and recovery is permitted before chill coma induction. However, we recommend that exposure to N(2) not be used as a method of anesthesia for chill coma studies.

17399760|a|Although human polyomavirus JC (JCV) is known to cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in immunocompromised individuals, the mechanism by which JCV crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains unclear. To test our hypothesis that cell-free JCV gains entry into the brain by infecting endothelial cells, we inoculated human brain microvascular endothelial (HBMVE) cells with 50 HAU (1.33+/-0.27 x 10(7) genome copies) of JCV(Mad1) and analyzed the expression of early and late viral genes and proteins by immunocytochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. JCV infected and replicated efficiently in HBMVE cells and produced infectious virions several hundred fold higher than the infecting inoculum. HBMVE cells in vitro did not express serotonin receptor 2A (5HT(2A)R), and 5HT(2A)R blockers did not prevent JCV infection of HBMVE cells. Collectively, our data indicate that the productive in vitro infection of HBMVE cells by JCV is independent of 5HT(2A)R.

16828722|t|Source memory retrieval is affected by aging and prefrontal lesions: behavioral and ERP evidence.
16828722|a|Age-related deficits in source memory have been attributed to alterations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) function, but little is known about the neural basis of such changes. The present study examined the time course of item and source memory retrieval by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) in patients with focal lesions in lateral PFC and in healthy older and young controls. Both normal aging and PFC lesions were associated with decrements in item and source memory. However, older controls showed a decrease in item hit rate with no change in false alarms, whereas patients showed the opposite pattern. Furthermore, ERPs revealed notable differences between the groups. The early positive-going old/new effect was prominent in the young but reduced in patients and older adults, who did not differ from each other. In contrast, older adults displayed a prominent left frontal negativity (600-1200 ms) not observed in the young. This left frontal effect was substantially smaller and delayed in the patients. The current results provide novel insights into the effects of aging on source memory and the role of the lateral PFC in these processes. Older controls appeared to adopt alternate memory strategies and to recruit compensatory mechanisms in left PFC to support task performance. In contrast, the lateral frontal patients were unable to use these mechanisms, thus exhibiting difficulties with strategic memory and monitoring processes.

17653070|a|OBJECTIVE: To study associations of size and body proportions at birth, and growth during infancy and childhood, to body composition and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors at the age of 6 years. DESIGN: The Pune Maternal Nutrition Study, a prospective population-based study of maternal nutrition and CVD risk in rural Indian children. METHODS: Body composition and CVD risk factors measured in 698 children at 6 years were related to body proportions and growth from birth. MEASUREMENTS: Anthropometry was performed every 6 months from birth. At 6 years, fat and lean mass (dual X-ray absorptiometry) and CVD risk factors (insulin resistance, blood pressure, glucose tolerance, plasma lipids) were measured. RESULTS: Compared with international references (NCHS, WHO) the children were short, light and thin (mean weight <-1.0 s.d. at all ages). Larger size and faster growth in all body measurements from birth to 6 years predicted higher lean and fat mass at 6 years. Weight and height predicted lean mass more strongly than fat mass, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) predicted them both approximately equally and skinfolds predicted only fat mass. Neither birthweight nor the 'thin-fat' newborn phenotype, was related to CVD risk factors. Smaller MUAC at 6 months predicted higher insulin resistance (P<0.001) but larger MUAC at 1 year predicted higher systolic blood pressure (P<0.001). After infancy, higher weight, height, MUAC and skinfolds, and faster growth of all these parameters were associated with increased CVD risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Slower muscle growth in infancy may increase insulin resistance but reduce blood pressure. After infancy larger size and faster growth of all body measurements are associated with a more adverse childhood CVD risk factor profile. These rural Indian children are growing below international 'norms' for body size and studies are required in other populations to determine the generalizability of the findings.

15931323|t|Contrast nephropathy.
15931323|a|Contrast nephropathy will increase mortality up to 30% following angiographic procedures. Before performing such procedures a careful reassessment of the risk/benefit ratio should be performed. Mannitol and diuretics play no role in prevention. Hydration and correction of abnormal electrolyte levels should be done in all patients. Pre-treatment with acetylcysteine and theophylline is a well-accepted strategy and should always be utilized. If creatinine levels are above 2.5 to 3 mg/dl, fenoldopam may provide additional protection, particularly in diabetic patients. However, the role of fenoldopam is controversial. Prophylactic hemodialysis may prove to be an additional tool in the fight against this disease in selected patients.

15057270|t|14-3-3 suppresses the nuclear localization of threonine 157-phosphorylated p27(Kip1).
15057270|a|p27(Kip1) (p27), a CDK inhibitor, migrates into the nucleus, where it controls cyclin-CDK complex activity for proper cell cycle progression. We report here that the classical bipartite-type basic amino-acid cluster and the two downstream amino acids of the C-terminal region of p27 function as a nuclear localization signal (NLS) for its full nuclear import activity. Importin alpha3 and alpha5, but not alpha1, transported p27 into the nucleus in conjunction with importin beta, as evidenced by an in vitro transport assay. It is known that Akt phosphorylates Thr 157 of p27 and this reduces the nuclear import activity of p27. Using a pull-down experiment, 14-3-3 was identified as the Thr157-phosphorylated p27NLS-binding protein. Although importin alpha5 bound to Thr157-phosphorylated p27NLS, 14-3-3 competed with importin alpha5 for binding to it. Thus, 14-3-3 sequestered phosphorylated p27NLS from importin alpha binding, resulting in cytoplasmic localization of NLS-phosphorylated p27. These findings indicate that 14-3-3 suppresses importin alpha/beta-dependent nuclear localization of Thr157-phosphorylated p27, suggesting implications for cell cycle disorder in Akt-activated cancer cells.

18031987|t|Prenatal methamphetamine use and neonatal neurobehavioral outcome.
18031987|a|BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MA) use among pregnant women is an increasing problem in the United States. How prenatal MA exposure affects neonatal neurobehavior is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the neurobehavioral effects of prenatal MA exposure. DESIGN: The Infant Development, Environment and Lifestyle (IDEAL) study screened 13,808 subjects and 1632 were eligible and consented. 166 (n=74 exposed) were enrolled in a longitudinal follow-up. Exposure was determined by meconium assay and self-report with alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco present in both groups. The NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) was administered within the first 5 days of life. Analyses conducted on NNNS summary scores included exposure group effects, heavy MA use effects, association with frequency of use by trimester, and dose-response relationships with amphetamine metabolites. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, exposure to MA was associated with increased physiological stress. Heavy MA use was related to lower arousal, more lethargy, and increased physiological stress. First trimester MA use was related to elevated stress abstinence. Third trimester use was related to poorer quality of movement. Higher level of amphetamine metabolites in meconium was associated with increased CNS stress. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal MA exposure was associated with neurobehavioral patterns of decreased arousal, increased stress, and poor quality of movement. The dose-response relationships may represent neurotoxic effects from MA.

18657545|t|Structure of the myristylated human immunodeficiency virus type 2 matrix protein and the role of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate in membrane targeting.
18657545|a|During the late phase of retroviral replication, newly synthesized Gag proteins are targeted to the plasma membrane (PM), where they assemble and bud to form immature virus particles. Membrane targeting by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag is mediated by the PM marker molecule phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)], which is capable of binding to the matrix (MA) domain of Gag in an extended lipid conformation and of triggering myristate exposure. Here, we show that, as observed previously for HIV-1 MA, the myristyl group of HIV-2 MA is partially sequestered within a narrow hydrophobic tunnel formed by side chains of helices 1, 2, 3, and 5. However, the myristate of HIV-2 MA is more tightly sequestered than that of the HIV-1 protein and does not exhibit concentration-dependent exposure. Soluble PI(4,5)P(2) analogs containing truncated acyl chains bind HIV-2 MA and induce minor long-range structural changes but do not trigger myristate exposure. Despite these differences, the site of HIV-2 assembly in vivo can be manipulated by enzymes that regulate PI(4,5)P(2) localization. Our findings indicate that HIV-1 and HIV-2 are both targeted to the PM for assembly via a PI(4,5)P(2)-dependent mechanism, despite differences in the sensitivity of the MA myristyl switch, and suggest a potential mechanism that may contribute to the poor replication kinetics of HIV-2.

17255026|t|Biodiversity hotspots through time: an introduction.
17255026|a|International targets set for reducing the rate of biodiversity loss--the 2010 target--and ensuring environmental stability (Millennium Development Goals) have helped to focus the efforts of the scientific community on providing the data necessary for their implementation. The urgency of these goals, coupled with the increased rate of habitat alteration worldwide, has meant that actions have largely not taken into account the increasing body of data about the biodiversity change in the past. We know a lot about how our planet has been altered and recovered in the past, both in deep time and through prehistory. Linking this knowledge to conservation action has not been widely practised, by either the palaeoecology or the conservation communities. Long-term data, however, have much to offer current conservation practice, and in the papers for this volume we have tried to bring together a variety of different perspectives as to how this might happen in the most effective way. We also identify areas for productive collaboration and some key synergies for work in the near future to enable our knowledge of the past to be used for conservation action in the here and now. Lateral thinking, across knowledge systems and with open-mindness about bridging data gaps, will be necessary for our accumulating knowledge about our planet's past to be brought to bear on our attempts to conserve it in the future.

15534200|t|Reversible oxidation and inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN in cells stimulated with peptide growth factors.
15534200|a|Stimulation of cells with various peptide growth factors induces the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The action of this enzyme is reversed by that of the tumor suppressor PTEN. With the use of cells overexpressing NADPH oxidase 1 or peroxiredoxin II, we have now shown that H2O2 produced in response to stimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor potentiates PIP3 generation and activation of the protein kinase Akt induced by these growth factors. We also show that a small fraction of PTEN molecules is transiently inactivated as a result of oxidation of the essential cysteine residue of this phosphatase in various cell types stimulated with epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or insulin. These results suggest that the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by growth factors might not be sufficient to induce the accumulation of PIP3 because of the opposing activity of PTEN and that the concomitant local inactivation of PTEN by H2O2 might be needed to increase the concentration of PIP3 sufficiently to trigger downstream signaling events. Furthermore, together with previous observations, our data indicate that peroxiredoxin likely participates in PIP3 signaling by modulating the local concentration of H2O2.

17889307|t|Chronic ethanol ingestion increases nitric oxide production in the lung.
17889307|a|Chronic ethanol (EtOH) ingestion increases the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The mechanisms underlying EtOH-induced susceptibility to lung injury continue to be defined. This study examines the hypothesis that EtOH increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and activity in the lungs of a rat model of chronic EtOH ingestion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed liquid diets containing EtOH (36% of calories) or maltose-dextrin as an isocaloric substitution for EtOH (control) for 6 weeks. Selected animals were also treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril (3 mg/l in diet) for 6 weeks. At study completion, animals were sacrificed, and lung tissue was collected for assays of nitric oxide (NO) metabolism or pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) were isolated for analysis of NO release. Compared to the control diet, chronic EtOH ingestion increased lung H2O2 production, eNOS expression and activity, lung cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content, and levels of protein nitration and oxidation. MVEC from animals with chronic EtOH ingestion released greater amounts of NO. EtOH-induced increases in lung H2O2 production, eNOS expression and activity, cGMP content, protein nitration and oxidation, and MVEC NO production were all attenuated by treatment with lisinopril. Chronic EtOH ingestion stimulates ACE-dependent increases in NO production in the lung. These novel findings indicate that chronic EtOH ingestion increases reactive species production in the lung parenchyma and provide new insights into mechanisms by which EtOH causes phenotypic alterations in the lung and alters the lung's response to inflammatory stimuli.

15775985|t|Role of oxidative carbonylation in protein quality control and senescence.
15775985|a|Proteins can become modified by a large number of reactions involving reactive oxygen species. Among these reactions, carbonylation has attracted a great deal of attention due to its irreversible and unrepairable nature. Carbonylated proteins are marked for proteolysis by the proteasome and the Lon protease but can escape degradation and form high-molecular-weight aggregates that accumulate with age. Such carbonylated aggregates can become cytotoxic and have been associated with a large number of age-related disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. This review focuses on the generation of and defence against protein carbonyls and speculates on the potential role of carbonylation in protein quality control, cellular deterioration, and senescence.

17307365|t|In vivo T(1rho) and T(2) mapping of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis of the knee using 3 T MRI.
17307365|a|OBJECTIVE: Evaluation and treatment of patients with early stages of osteoarthritis (OA) is dependent upon an accurate assessment of the cartilage lesions. However, standard cartilage dedicated magnetic resonance (MR) techniques are inconclusive in quantifying early degenerative changes. The objective of this study was to determine the ability of MR T1rho (T(1rho)) and T(2) mapping to detect cartilage matrix degeneration between normal and early OA patients. METHOD: Sixteen healthy volunteers (mean age 41.3) without clinical or radiological evidence of OA and 10 patients (mean age 55.9) with OA were scanned using a 3Tesla (3T) MR scanner. Cartilage volume and thickness, and T(1rho) and T(2) values were compared between normal and OA patients. The relationship between T(1rho) and T(2) values, and Kellgren-Lawrence scores based on plain radiographs and the cartilage lesion grading based on MR images were studied. RESULTS: The average T(1rho) and T(2) values were significantly increased in OA patients compared with controls (52.04+/-2.97ms vs 45.53+/-3.28ms with P=0.0002 for T(1rho), and 39.63+/-2.69ms vs 34.74+/-2.48ms with P=0.001 for T(2)). Increased T(1rho) and T(2) values were correlated with increased severity in radiographic and MR grading of OA. T(1rho) has a larger range and higher effect size than T(2), 3.7 vs 3.0. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that both in vivo T(1rho) and T(2) relaxation times increase with the degree of cartilage degeneration. T(1rho) relaxation time may be a more sensitive indicator for early cartilage degeneration than T(2). The ability to detect early cartilage degeneration prior to morphologic changes may allow us to critically monitor the course of OA and injury progression, and to evaluate the success of treatment to patients with early stages of OA.

15272081|t|5' Long serial analysis of gene expression (LongSAGE) and 3' LongSAGE for transcriptome characterization and genome annotation.
15272081|a|Complete genome annotation relies on precise identification of transcription units bounded by a transcription initiation site (TIS) and a polyadenylation site (PAS). To facilitate this process, we developed a set of two complementary methods, 5' Long serial analysis of gene expression (LS) and 3'LS. These analyses are based on the original SAGE and LS methods coupled with full-length cDNA cloning, and enable the high-throughput extraction of the first and the last 20 bp of each transcript. We demonstrate that the mapping of 5'LS and 3'LS tags to the genome allows the localization of TIS and PAS. By using 537 tag pairs mapping to the region of known genes, we confirmed that >90% of the tag pairs appropriately assigned to the first and last exons. Moreover, by using tag sequences as primers for RT-PCRs, we were able to recover putative full-length transcripts in 81% of the attempts. This large-scale generation of transcript terminal tags is at least 20-40 times more efficient than full-length cDNA cloning and sequencing in the identification of complete transcription units. The apparent precision and deep coverage makes 5'LS and 3'LS an advanced approach for genome annotation through whole-transcriptome characterization.

17692461|t|Vasoactive intestinal peptide induction by ciliary neurotrophic factor in donor human corneal endothelium in situ.
17692461|a|After peripheral nerve axotomy, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene expression is upregulated in neurons, whereas ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) accumulates extracellularly at the lesion site. Although CNTF-induced VIP gene expression has been reported in cultured sympathetic neurons and neuroblastoma cells, it still remains to be determined if CNTF and VIP play interrelated roles in nerve injury. The corneal endothelium, like sympathetic neurons, derives from the neural crest. Previously, we demonstrated that a sublethal-level of oxidative stress induces CNTF release from corneal endothelial (CE) cells in situ. Here, we show that human CE cells express the 53 kDa ligand-binding alpha subunit of the CNTF receptor (CNTFRalpha). We further demonstrate that CNTF induces VIP immunoreactivity in human donor corneas. To determine if the increase in VIP immunoreactivity was reflected by an increase in gene expression, donor human corneas were bisected and treated with CNTF or vehicle, and analyzed by real-time RT-qPCR. Two experiments using different sets of bisected corneas indicated that CNTF induced increases in VIP mRNA levels of 6.5+/-2.2-fold (N=7 corneas) and 2.3+/-0.6-fold (N=10 corneas) (mean+/-S.E.M.), respectively. Whereas VIP is produced as a CE autocrine factor against oxidative stress, the present study suggested that oxidative stress-released CNTF plays a role in protecting CE cells against oxidative stress injury by upregulating VIP expression.

17854434|t|Cost-effectiveness of motivational interviewing for smoking cessation and relapse prevention among low-income pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial.
17854434|a|OBJECTIVES: Low-income women have high rates of smoking during pregnancy, but little is known about the costs, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of motivational interviewing (MI), focused on the medical and psychosocial needs of this population, as an intervention for smoking cessation and relapse prevention. METHODS: A sample of 302 low-income pregnant women was recruited from multiple obstetrical sites in the Boston metropolitan area into a randomized controlled trial of a motivational intervention for smoking cessation and relapse prevention versus usual care (UC). The findings of this clinical trial were used to estimate the costs, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention from a societal perspective, incorporating published quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY) estimates. Outcomes included smoking cessation and relapse, maternal and infant outcomes, economic costs, LYs and QALYs saved, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of MI for relapse prevention compared to UC was estimated to be $851/LY saved and $628/QALY saved. Including savings in maternal medical costs in sensitivity analyses resulted in cost savings for MI for relapse prevention compared to UC. For smoking cessation, MI cost more but did not provide additional benefit compared to UC. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness of MI versus UC would have been $117,100/LY saved and $86,300/QALY saved if 8% of smokers had quit. In two-way sensitivity analyses, MI was still relatively cost-effective for relapse prevention ($17,300/QALY saved) even if it cost as much as $2000/participant and was less effective. For smoking cessation, however, a higher level of effectiveness (9/110) and higher cost ($400/participant) resulted in higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ($112,000/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Among low-income pregnant women, MI helps prevent relapse at relatively low cost, and may be cost-saving when net medical cost savings are considered. For smoking cessation, MI cost more but provided no additional benefit compared to UC, but might offer benefits at costs comparable to other clinical preventive interventions if 8-10% of smokers are induced to quit.

15857768|t|Manduca sexta prophenoloxidase activating proteinase-1 (PAP-1) gene: organization, expression, and regulation by immune and hormonal signals.
15857768|a|Insect phenoloxidase (PO) participates in melanotic encapsulation, wound healing, and cuticle sclerotization. It is converted from prophenoloxidase (proPO) by a proPO-activating proteinase (PAP). Manduca sexta PAP-1, the final component of a serine proteinase cascade, cleaves proPO to generate active PO. In an effort to understand the transcriptional regulation, we isolated a genomic clone of the PAP-1 gene, determined its nucleotide sequence, and elucidated its exon-intron organization. Computer analysis revealed several immune and hormone responsive elements in the upstream region. Southern blot analysis suggested that the M. sexta genome contains a single copy of PAP-1 gene. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that PAP-1 was constitutively expressed in fat body, trachea, and nerve tissue of the fifth instar larvae. The mRNA levels in hemocytes and fat body markedly increased in response to a bacterial challenge. We also observed tissue-specific and developmental regulation of the gene's transcription. Treating M. sexta fat body culture with 20-hydroxyecdysone reduced the PAP-1 mRNA level. These data indicated that the expression of PAP-1 gene is under the dual control of immune and hormonal signals.

17046758|t|A polymorphism in New Zealand inbred mouse strains that inactivates phosphatidylcholine transfer protein.
17046758|a|New Zealand obese (NZO/HlLt) male mice develop polygenic diabetes and altered phosphatidylcholine metabolism. The gene encoding phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP) is sited within the support interval for Nidd3, a recessive NZO-derived locus on Chromosome 11 identified by prior segregation analysis between NZO/HlLt and NON/Lt. Sequence analysis revealed that the NZO-derived PC-TP contained a non-synonymous point mutation that resulted in an Arg120His substitution, which was shared by the related NZB/BlNJ and NZW/LacJ mouse strains. Consistent with the structure-based predictions, functional studies demonstrated that Arg120His PC-TP was inactive, suggesting that this mutation contributes to the deficiencies in phosphatidylcholine metabolism observed in NZO mice.

17307283|t|Continuum simulations of acetylcholine diffusion with reaction-determined boundaries in neuromuscular junction models.
17307283|a|The reaction-diffusion system of the neuromuscular junction has been modeled in 3D using the finite element package FEtk. The numerical solution of the dynamics of acetylcholine with the detailed reaction processes of acetylcholinesterases and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors has been discussed with the reaction-determined boundary conditions. The simulation results describe the detailed acetylcholine hydrolysis process, and reveal the time-dependent interconversion of the closed and open states of the acetylcholine receptors as well as the percentages of unliganded/monoliganded/diliganded states during the neuro-transmission. The finite element method has demonstrated its flexibility and robustness in modeling large biological systems.

17449008|t|The effect of prism orientation on the indentation testing of human molar enamel.
17449008|a|Recent nanoindentation studies have demonstrated that the hardness and Young's modulus of human molar enamel decreases by more than 50% on moving from the occlusal surface to the dentine-enamel junction on cross-sectional samples. Possible sources of these variations are changes in local chemistry, microstructure, and prism orientation. This study investigates the latter source by performing nanoindentation tests at two different orientations relative to the hydroxyapatite prisms: parallel and perpendicular. A single sample volume was tested in order to maintain a constant chemistry and microstructure. The resulting data show very small differences between the two orientations for both hardness and Young's modulus. The 1.5-3.0% difference is significantly less than the standard deviations found within the data set. Thus, the variations in hardness and Young's modulus on cross-sectional samples of human molar are attributed to changes in local chemistry (varying levels of mineralization, organic matter, and water content) and changes in microstructure (varying volume fractions of inorganic crystals and organic matrix). The impact of prism orientation on mechanical properties measured at this scale by nanoindentation appears to be minimal.

15601824|t|Polybromo protein BAF180 functions in mammalian cardiac chamber maturation.
15601824|a|BAF and PBAF are two related mammalian chromatin remodeling complexes essential for gene expression and development. PBAF, but not BAF, is able to potentiate transcriptional activation in vitro mediated by nuclear receptors, such as RXRalpha, VDR, and PPARgamma. Here we show that the ablation of PBAF-specific subunit BAF180 in mouse embryos results in severe hypoplastic ventricle development and trophoblast placental defects, similar to those found in mice lacking RXRalpha and PPARgamma. Embryonic aggregation analyses reveal that in contrast to PPARgamma-deficient mice, the heart defects are likely a direct result of BAF180 ablation, rather than an indirect consequence of trophoblast placental defects. We identified potential target genes for BAF180 in heart development, such as S100A13 as well as retinoic acid (RA)-induced targets RARbeta2 and CRABPII. Importantly, BAF180 is recruited to the promoter of these target genes and BAF180 deficiency affects the RA response for CRABPII and RARbeta2. These studies reveal unique functions of PBAF in cardiac chamber maturation.

15583132|t|Toward an evolutionary perspective on conceptual representation: species-specific calls activate visual and affective processing systems in the macaque.
15583132|a|Non-human primates produce a diverse repertoire of species-specific calls and have rich conceptual systems. Some of their calls are designed to convey information about concepts such as predators, food, and social relationships, as well as the affective state of the caller. Little is known about the neural architecture of these calls, and much of what we do know is based on single-cell physiology from anesthetized subjects. By using positron emission tomography in awake rhesus macaques, we found that conspecific vocalizations elicited activity in higher-order visual areas, including regions in the temporal lobe associated with the visual perception of object form (TE/TEO) and motion (superior temporal sulcus) and storing visual object information into long-term memory (TE), as well as in limbic (the amygdala and hippocampus) and paralimbic regions (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) associated with the interpretation and memory-encoding of highly salient and affective material. This neural circuitry strongly corresponds to the network shown to support representation of conspecifics and affective information in humans. These findings shed light on the evolutionary precursors of conceptual representation in humans, suggesting that monkeys and humans have a common neural substrate for representing object concepts.

15071497|t|Cullin-based ubiquitin ligases: Cul3-BTB complexes join the family.
15071497|a|Cullin-based E3 ligases target substrates for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the 26S proteasome. The SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) and ECS (ElonginC-Cul2-SOCS box) complexes are so far the best-characterized cullin-based ligases. Their atomic structure has been solved recently, and several substrates have been described in different organisms. In addition to Cul1 and Cul2, higher eucaryotic genomes encode for three other cullins: Cul3, Cul4, and Cul5. Recent results have shed light on the molecular composition and function of Cul3-based E3 ligases. In these complexes, BTB-domain-containing proteins may bridge the cullin to the substrate in a single polypeptide, while Skp1/F-box or ElonginC/SOCS heterodimers fulfill this function in the SCF and ECS complexes. BTB-containing proteins are evolutionary conserved and involved in diverse biological processes, but their function has not previously been linked to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. In this review, we present these new findings and compare the composition of Cul3-based ligases to the well-defined SCF and ECS ligases.

17349451|t|Cost-effectiveness of treatment for hepatitis C in an urban cohort co-infected with HIV.
17349451|a|PURPOSE: Recent clinical trials have evaluated treatment strategies for chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Our objective was to use these data to examine the cost-effectiveness of treating HCV in an urban cohort of co-infected patients. METHODS: A computer-based model, together with available published data, was used to estimate lifetime costs (2004 US dollars), life expectancy, and incremental cost per year of life saved (YLS) associated with 3 treatment strategies: (1) interferon-alfa and ribavirin; (2) pegylated interferon-alfa; and (3) pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin. The target population included treatment-eligible patients, based on an actual urban cohort of HIV-HCV co-infected subjects, with a mean age of 44 years, of whom 66% had genotype 1 HCV, 16% had cirrhosis, and 98% had CD4 cell counts >200 cells/mm3. RESULTS: Pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin was consistently more effective and cost-effective than other treatment strategies, particularly in patients with non-genotype 1 HCV. For patients with CD4 counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3, survival benefits ranged from 5 to 11 months, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were consistently less than $75,000 per YLS for men and women of both genotypes. Due to better treatment efficacy in non-genotype 1 HCV patients, this group experienced greater life expectancy gains and lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin for HCV in eligible co-infected patients with stable HIV disease provides substantial life-expectancy benefits and appears to be cost-effective. Overcoming barriers to HCV treatment eligibility among urban co-infected patients remains a critical priority.

17034585|t|The myeloid differentiation factor 88 is dispensable for the development of a delayed host response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in mice.
17034585|a|Because MyD88 transduces a core set of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced signals, microbial-induced host responses can be divided broadly into the MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways. A specific pathogen induces a distinct pattern of host response dependent upon the signalling pathways employed. Recently, we demonstrated that a MyD88-dependent pathway is essential for the development of early (4-8 h) host response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection. Here, we show that the development of a delayed (24-48 h) host response to P. aeruginosa is independent of MyD88. Using MyD88-deficient mice, the production of macrophage inflammatory protein 2, tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 1alpha in the airway was observed following P. aeruginosa lung infection for 24 or 48 h. Moreover, the MyD88-deficient mice recruited sufficient neutrophils in the lung and cleared the bacteria efficiently from the lung after 48 h. Thus, the full development of host responses to P. aeruginosa lung infection involves, in a sequential, stepwise fashion, a MyD88-dependent early response and a MyD88-independent delayed mechanism.

19204574|t|MYC and EIF3H Coamplification significantly improve response and survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC) treated with gefitinib.
19204574|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated the incidence of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit H (EIF3H) and MYC amplification in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and whether MYC/EIF3H increased gene copy number affected response to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. METHODS: Metastatic NSCLC patients (n = 54) treated with gefitinib were analyzed for the genomic content of EIF3H and MYC genes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a custom-designed 3-color DNA probe set. RESULT: Amplification of EIF3H (ratio EIF3H/CEP8 >2), was observed in 10 cases (18.5%), and MYC was coamplified in all. MYC amplification without coamplification of EIF3H was observed in 2 cases (3.7%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to identify the cutoff for MYC and EIF3H copy number best discriminating sensitive and resistant populations. MYC FISH positive patients (MYC+, mean > or =2.8) had a significantly higher response rate (p = 0.003), longer time to progression (p = 0.01) and overall survival (OS: p = 0.02) than MYC- (mean <2.8). Similarly, EIF3H FISH positive patients (EIF3H+, mean > or =2.75) had a significantly higher response rate (p = 0.002), longer time to progression (p = 0.01) and OS (p = 0.01) than EIF3H- (mean <2.75). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that MYC and EIF3H are frequently coamplified in NSCLC and that a high copy number correlates with increased epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors sensitivity.

17576363|t|The immune response during a Strongyloides ratti infection of rats.
17576363|a|A range of immune parameters was measured during a primary infection of Strongyloides ratti in its natural rat host. The immune parameters measured were interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma from both the spleen and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells; parasite-specific immunoglobulin G(1)(IgG(1)), IgG(2a) and IgG(2b) in serum and in intestinal tissue; parasite-specific IgG and total IgE in serum; parasite-specific and total IgA in intestinal tissue and rat mast cell protease II in intestinal tissue. Parasite-specific IgG(1), IgG(2a) and total IgE in serum and parasite-specific IgA and rat mast cell protease II in intestinal tissue all occurred at significantly greater concentrations in infected animals, compared with non-infected animals. Similarly, the production of IL-4 by MLN cells stimulated with parasitic female antigen or concanavalin A occurred at significantly greater concentrations in infected animals, compared with non-infected animals. In all, this suggests that there is a T-helper 2-type immune response during a primary S. ratti infection. These data also show the temporal changes in these components of the host immune response during a primary S. ratti infection.

18052874|a|Chloroquine (CHQ), an antimalarial, is also used as an anti-inflammatory drug for systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the frequency of organ involvement and disease flares, and relieves skin and joint symptoms. CHQ reduces the immunologically-mediated inflammation of the joints. HCQ and combination therapies have a significant benefit on synovitis, pain and physical disability on RA. We advocate the investment of resistance Plasmodium prevalence determinations in countries beset by malaria, and to match thereafter the quantity of persons administered CHQ. Follow-up investigations are essential to diagnose and prevent visual damage.

18492395|t|The case for standardisation of the management of gallstones spilled and not retrieved at laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
18492395|a|INTRODUCTION: This observational study was carried out to establish how surgeons performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy currently deal with the issue of spilled gallstones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was circulated amongst laparoscopic surgeons attending the annual conference of the Association of Laparoscopic Surgery of Great Britain and Ireland in November 2006. RESULTS: Eighty-two surgeons completed the questionnaire. Only half of surgeons inform patients when gallstones are spilled. Less than 30% of surgeons inform general practitioners (GPs) of this complication, when it occurs. Less than a quarter of surgeons include this information in the consent literature provided to patients. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that trusts review their policy towards spilled stones either by local audit or adopt the guidance given by the UK Healthcare Commission. While some surgeons feel informing patients and GPs may unnecessarily heighten anxiety from an uncommon complication, our review of the literature suggests this position is not tenable in the current medicolegal climate.

15103327|t|Analysis of the composition, assembly kinetics and activity of native Apaf-1 apoptosomes.
15103327|a|The Apaf-1 apoptosome is a multi-subunit caspase-activating scaffold that is assembled in response to diverse forms of cellular stress that culminate in apoptosis. To date, most studies on apoptosome composition and function have used apoptosomes reassembled from recombinant or purified proteins. Thus, the precise composition of native apoptosomes remains unresolved. Here, we have used a one-step immunopurification approach to isolate catalytically active Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosomes, and have identified the major constituents of these complexes using mass spectrometry methods. Using this approach, we have also assessed the ability of putative apoptosome regulatory proteins, such as Smac/DIABLO and PHAPI, to regulate the activity of native apoptosomes. We show that Apaf-1, caspase-9, caspase-3 and XIAP are the major constituents of native apoptosomes and that cytochrome c is not stably associated with the active complex. We also demonstrate that the IAP-neutralizing protein Smac/DIABLO and the tumor-suppressor protein PHAPI can enhance the catalytic activity of apoptosome complexes in distinct ways. Surprisingly, PHAPI also enhanced the activity of purified caspase-3, suggesting that it may act as a co-factor for this protease.

17250585|t|The retrocyclin analogue RC-101 prevents human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of a model human cervicovaginal tissue construct.
17250585|a|Retrocyclins are cyclic antimicrobial peptides that exhibit potent activity towards a broad range of primary and laboratory-adapted strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vitro. The current study shows that RC-101, an analogue of retrocyclin, prevented HIV-1 infection in an organ-like construct of human cervicovaginal tissue and retained full activity in the presence of vaginal fluid. The peptide remained within the cervicovaginal tissues throughout the 9-day incubation period without altering tissue viability, inducing damage or inducing the release of inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these data support the potential development of RC-101 as a topical microbicide to prevent HIV-1 infection and transmission.

15103332|t|Ectodomain shedding of the glycoprotein GP of Ebola virus.
15103332|a|In this study, release of abundant amounts of the Ebola virus (EBOV) surface glycoprotein GP in a soluble form from virus-infected cells was investigated. We demonstrate that the mechanism responsible for the release of GP is ectodomain shedding mediated by cellular sheddases. Proteolytic cleavage taking place at amino-acid position D637 removes the transmembrane anchor and liberates complexes consisting of GP1 and truncated GP2 (GP(2delta)) subunits from the cell surface. We show that tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme (TACE), a member of the ADAM family of zinc-dependent metalloproteases, is involved in EBOV GP shedding. This finding shows for the first time that virus-encoded surface glycoproteins are substrates for ADAMs. Furthermore, we provide evidence that shed GP is present in significant amounts in the blood of virus-infected animals and that it may play an important role in the pathogenesis of infection by efficiently blocking the activity of virus-neutralizing antibodies.

15342493|t|Vilse, a conserved Rac/Cdc42 GAP mediating Robo repulsion in tracheal cells and axons.
15342493|a|Slit proteins steer the migration of many cell types through their binding to Robo receptors, but how Robo controls cell motility is not clear. We describe the functional analysis of vilse, a Drosophila gene required for Robo repulsion in epithelial cells and axons. Vilse defines a conserved family of RhoGAPs (Rho GTPase-activating proteins), with representatives in flies and vertebrates. The phenotypes of vilse mutants resemble the tracheal and axonal phenotypes of Slit and Robo mutants at the CNS midline. Dosage-sensitive genetic interactions between vilse, slit, and robo mutants suggest that vilse is a component of robo signaling. Moreover, overexpression of Vilse in the trachea of robo mutants ameliorates the phenotypes of robo, indicating that Vilse acts downstream of Robo to mediate midline repulsion. Vilse and its human homolog bind directly to the intracellular domains of the corresponding Robo receptors and promote the hydrolysis of RacGTP and, less efficiently, of Cdc42GTP. These results together with genetic interaction experiments with robo, vilse, and rac mutants suggest a mechanism whereby Robo repulsion is mediated by the localized inactivation of Rac through Vilse.

17765232|t|Differential expression of microRNA species in human uterine leiomyoma versus normal myometrium.
17765232|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether microRNAs (miRNAs) are differentially expressed in human leiomyoma versus matched myometrial tissue. DESIGN: Microarray with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) validation. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENT(S): Premenopausal subjects (n = 15), who were undergoing hysterectomies for leiomyoma-related symptoms. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Statistically differential expression of miRNAs in leiomyoma versus myometrium. RESULT(S): Forty-six miRNA species were differentially expressed in leiomyoma versus normal myometrium. Of these, 19 were overexpressed and 27 were underexpressed in leiomyomas. The changes ranged from 1.2-fold to 11.8-fold. These findings were confirmed using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for selected miRNAs (miRNAs 21, 34a, 125b, 139, and 323). CONCLUSION(S): Our findings indicate that miRNAs are differentially expressed between human leiomyoma and matched myometrium. Given this differential expression, miRNAs may play a role in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma and may serve as future therapeutic targets for the treatment of these tumors.

We recently performed a microarray analysis comparing human monocyte responses to the highly virulent F. tularensis tularensis Schu S4 strain (F.t.) versus the less virulent F. tularensis novicida (F.n.).(1) Many groups of genes were affected, including those involved with autophagy and with the regulation of autophagy. Here, we discuss the implications in the context of Francisella virulence and host cell response, then conclude with potential future experiments.

15563588|t|Processing of Notch and amyloid precursor protein by gamma-secretase is spatially distinct.
15563588|a|gamma-Secretase activity is associated with a presenilin (PS)-containing macromolecular complex. Whether PS contains the active site of gamma-secretase has been controversial. One challenge is to find PS that is engaged in the active gamma-secretase complex at the cell surface, where some substrates appear to be processed. In this study, we developed an intact cell photolabeling technique that allows the direct visualization of active gamma-secretase at the cell surface. We demonstrated that active gamma-secretase is present in the plasma membrane. Moreover, the PS1 heterodimer is specifically photolabeled at the cell surface by a potent inhibitor that binds to only the active gamma-secretase. We also explored the cellular processing sites of gamma-secretase for amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch by using small molecular probes. MRL631, a gamma-secretase inhibitor that is unable to penetrate the cell membrane, significantly blocks gamma-secretase-mediated Notch cleavage but has little effect on APP processing. These results indicate that Notch is processed at the cell surface and that the majority of APP is processed by intracellular gamma-secretase. Furthermore, the fact that inhibitors first target gamma-secretase in the plasma membrane for Notch processing, and not for APP, will have important implications for drug development to treat Alzheimer's disease and cancer.

15569941|t|Targeted disruption of luteinizing hormone beta-subunit leads to hypogonadism, defects in gonadal steroidogenesis, and infertility.
15569941|a|Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) act on gonadal cells to promote steroidogenesis and gametogenesis. Clarifying the in vivo roles of LH and FSH permits a feasible approach to contraception involving selective blockade of gonadotropin action. One way to address these physiologically important problems is to generate mice with an isolated LH deficiency and compare them with existing FSH loss-of-function mice. To model human reproductive disorders involving loss of LH function and to define LH-responsive genes, we produced knockout mice lacking the hormone-specific LHbeta-subunit. LHbeta-null mice are viable but demonstrate postnatal defects in gonadal growth and function resulting in infertility. Mutant males have decreased testes size, prominent Leydig cell hypoplasia, defects in expression of genes encoding steroid biosynthesis pathway enzymes, and reduced testosterone levels. Furthermore, spermatogenesis is blocked at the round spermatid stage, causing a total absence of the elongated spermatids. Mutant female mice are hypogonadal and demonstrate decreased levels of serum estradiol and progesterone. Ovarian histology demonstrates normal thecal layer, defects in folliculogenesis including many degenerating antral follicles, and absence of corpora lutea. The defects in both sexes are not secondary to aberrant FSH regulation, because FSH levels were unaffected in null mice. Finally, both male and female null mice can be pharmacologically rescued by exogenous human chorionic gonadotropin, indicating that LH-responsiveness of the target cells is not irreversibly lost. Thus, LHbeta null mice represent a model to study the consequences of an isolated deficiency of LH ligand in reproduction, while retaining normal LH-responsiveness in target cells.

15509685|t|Karyometry detects subvisual differences in chromatin organisation state between non-recurrent and recurrent papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential.
15509685|a|AIM: To analyse nuclear chromatin texture in non-recurrent and recurrent papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential (PUNLMPs). MATERIALS: Ninety three karyometric features were analysed on haematoxylin and eosin stained sections from 20 PUNLMP cases: 10 from patients with a solitary PUNLMP lesion, who were disease free during at least eight years' follow up, and 10 from patients with unifocal PUNLMP, one or more recurrences being seen during follow up. RESULTS: Kruskal-Wallis analysis was used to search for features showing significant differences between recurrent and non-recurrent cases. Significance was better than p<0.005 for more than 20 features. Based on significance, six texture features were selected for discriminant analysis. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis reduced Wilk's lambda to 0.87, indicating a highly significant difference between the two multivariate data sets, but only modest ability to discriminate (70% correct case classification). A box sequential classifier was used based on data derived from discriminant analysis. The classifier took three classification steps and classified 19 of the 20 cases correctly (95% correct case classification). To determine whether significant case grouping could also be obtained based on an objective criterion, the merged data sets of non-recurrent and recurrent cases were submitted to the unsupervised learning algorithm P-index. Two clusters were formed with significant differences. The subsequent application of a Cooley/Lohnes classifier resulted in an overall correct case classification rate of 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Karyometry and multivariate analyses detect subvisual differences in chromatin organisation state between non-recurrent and recurrent PUNLMPs, thus allowing identification of lesions that do or do not recur.

17881570|t|Wnt5a inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in hematopoietic stem cells and enhances repopulation.
17881570|a|The mechanisms that regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate decisions between proliferation and multilineage differentiation are unclear. Members of the Wnt family of ligands that activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which utilizes beta-catenin to relay the signal, have been demonstrated to regulate HSC function. In this study, we examined the role of noncanonical Wnt signaling in regulating HSC fate. We observed that noncanonical Wnt5a inhibited Wnt3a-mediated canonical Wnt signaling in HSCs and suppressed Wnt3a-mediated alterations in gene expression associated with HSC differentiation, such as increased expression of myc. Wnt5a increased short- and long-term HSC repopulation by maintaining HSCs in a quiescent G(0) state. From these data, we propose that Wnt5a regulates hematopoiesis by the antagonism of the canonical Wnt pathway, resulting in a pool of quiescent HSCs.

18756064|t|Risk factors for failure of initial intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in Kawasaki disease.
18756064|a|The aims of this study were to determine the occurrence and variables associated with the initial intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment failure in Kawasaki disease (KD) and to categorize differences in clinical characteristics between responders and nonresponders to initial IVIG treatment. Patients were classified into two groups. Group A included 33 patients who received a single dose of IVIG treatment and responded. Group B included 18 patients who received more than two doses of IVIG due to failure of the initial treatment. The mean duration of fever after initial treatment in group B was significantly longer than it was in group A. In group B, we found that higher bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) (%), and lower platelet values at baseline were independent predictors of persistent or recurrent fever in patients with KD. Coronary artery abnormalities were found in 8 patients (44.4%) in group B and in two patients (6.1%) in group A. We found that abnormal liver function tests and a lower platelet count at baseline were possible predictors of nonresponders to IVIG in patients with KD. There is a need for a prospective study focused on baseline hepatobiliary parameters.

18723030|t|Evolutionary dynamics of redundant regulatory control.
18723030|a|Many complex regulatory processes concern tracking a constant or variable set point. Examples include temperature homeostasis, rhythmic oscillation, and the concentration of key metabolites and enzymes. Control over homeostatic or tracking phenotypes often depends on multiple, overlapping regulatory systems. In this paper, I develop a theory for the evolutionary dynamics of redundant regulatory control architecture. Prior theories analyzed the evolution of redundant control architectures by the balance between improved performance for additional redundant control weighed against the decay by germline mutation that arises in characters with overlapping function. By contrast, I argue that germline mutation is likely to be a very weak balancing force in evolutionary dynamics. Instead, I analyze the evolutionary dynamics of redundant control by a balance between the benefits of reduced tracking error and the costs of building and running the multiple control systems. In one particular mathematical model that highlights key features of evolutionary dynamics, additional redundant control reduces tracking error multiplicatively but contributes to costs additively. In that model, the performance landscape has multiple peaks of the same height, one peak for each level of redundancy and the associated optimal investment per control structure. The multipeak landscape imposes evolutionary stasis, in which control systems resist invasion by increased or decreased levels of redundancy. However, fluctuating environments likely favor a rise in redundancy over time. With greater redundancy, investment per individual control structure declines, causing a decay in the performance of each individual dimension of control. I conclude that the costs of control structures may influence regulatory architecture.

18465205|t|In vivo imaging of the effect of LPS on arterial endothelial cells: molecular imaging of heat shock protein 60 expression.
18465205|a|Bacterial endotoxins are known as stress factors for endothelial cells. In 20 normocholesterolemic New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits, endothelial stress was induced by intravenous (i.v.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while eight NZW rabbits were sham-treated or served as untreated controls. In vivo molecular imaging was performed using co-registered computer tomography and positron emission tomography 24 h after i.v. injection of (124)I-labeled monoclonal anti-HSP60 or (124)I-radiolabelled isotype control antibodies. Compared to control animals, in vivo images of rabbit aortae revealed significantly increased endothelial binding of (124)I-labeled anti-HSP60 antibodies upon LPS, especially at sites of aortal branching. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and autoradiography data. Our results showed, as proof-of-principle, that HSP60-expression in normocholesterolemic rabbits is significantly increased after induction of endothelial stress and that non-invasive in vivo molecular imaging of early aortal HSP60-expression using (124)I-labeled anti-HSP60 monoclonal antibodies is possible.

17217339|t|Cross-talk between IRAK-4 and the NADPH oxidase.
17217339|a|Exposure of neutrophils to LPS (lipopolysaccharide) triggers their oxidative response. However, the relationship between the signalling downstream of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) after LPS stimulation and the activation of the oxidase remains elusive. Phosphorylation of the cytosolic factor p47phox is essential for activation of the NADPH oxidase. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that IRAK-4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4), the main regulatory kinase downstream of TLR4 activation, regulates the NADPH oxidase through phosphorylation of p47phox. We show that p47phox is a substrate for IRAK-4. Unlike PKC (protein kinase C), IRAK-4 phosphorylates p47phox not only at serine residues, but also at threonine residues. Target residues were identified by tandem MS, revealing a novel threonine-rich regulatory domain. We also show that p47phox is phosphorylated in granulocytes in response to LPS stimulation. LPS-dependent phosphorylation of p47phox was enhanced by the inhibition of p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), confirming that the kinase operates upstream of p38 MAPK. IRAK-4-phosphorylated p47phox activated the NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system, and IRAK-4 overexpression increased NADPH oxidase activity in response to LPS. We have shown that endogenous IRAK-4 interacts with p47phox and they co-localize at the plasma membrane after LPS stimulation, using immunoprecipitation assays and immunofluorescence microscopy respectively. IRAK-4 was activated in neutrophils in response to LPS stimulation. We found that Thr133, Ser288 and Thr356, targets for IRAK-4 phosphorylation in vitro, are also phosphorylated in endogenous p47phox after LPS stimulation. We conclude that IRAK-4 phosphorylates p47phox and regulates NADPH oxidase activation after LPS stimulation.

15574598|t|Su(var) genes regulate the balance between euchromatin and heterochromatin in Drosophila.
15574598|a|Histone lysine methylation is an epigenetic mark to index chromosomal subdomains. In Drosophila, H3-K9 di- and trimethylation is mainly controlled by the heterochromatic SU(VAR)3-9 HMTase, a major regulator of position-effect variegation (PEV). In contrast, H3-K27 methylation states are independently mediated by the Pc-group enzyme E(Z). Isolation of 19 point mutants demonstrates that the silencing potential of Su(var)3-9 increases with its associated HMTase activity. A hyperactive Su(var)3-9 mutant, pitkin(D), displays extensive H3-K9 di- and trimethylation within but also outside pericentric heterochromatin. Notably, mutations in a novel Su(var) gene, Su(var)3-1, severely restrict Su(var)3-9-mediated gene silencing. Su(var)3-1 was identified as "antimorphic" mutants of the euchromatic H3-S10 kinase JIL-1. JIL-1(Su(var)3-1) mutants maintain kinase activity and do not detectably impair repressive histone lysine methylation marks. However, analyses with seven different PEV rearrangements demonstrate a general role of JIL-1(Su(var)3-1) in controlling heterochromatin compaction and expansion. Our data provide evidence for a dynamic balance between heterochromatin and euchromatin, and define two distinct mechanisms for Su(var) gene function. Whereas the majority of Su(var)s encode inherent components of heterochromatin that can establish repressive chromatin structures [intrinsic Su(var)s], Su(var)3-1 reflects gain-of-function mutants of a euchromatic component that antagonize the expansion of heterochromatic subdomains [acquired Su(var)s].

16314459|t|Accessibility of 18S rRNA in human 40S subunits and 80S ribosomes at physiological magnesium ion concentrations--implications for the study of ribosome dynamics.
16314459|a|Protein biosynthesis requires numerous conformational rearrangements within the ribosome. The structural core of the ribosome is composed of RNA and is therefore dependent on counterions such as magnesium ions for function. Many steps of translation can be compromised or inhibited if the concentration of Mg(2+) is too low or too high. Conditions previously used to probe the conformation of the mammalian ribosome in vitro used high Mg(2+) concentrations that we find completely inhibit translation in vitro. We have therefore probed the conformation of the small ribosomal subunit in low concentrations of Mg(2+) that support translation in vitro and compared it with the conformation of the 40S subunit at high Mg(2+) concentrations. In low Mg(2+) concentrations, we find significantly more changes in chemical probe accessibility in the 40S subunit due to subunit association or binding of the hepatitis C internal ribosomal entry site (HCV IRES) than had been observed before. These results suggest that the ribosome is more dynamic in its functional state than previously appreciated.

18215408|t|On the evolution of epistasis III: the haploid case with mutation.
18215408|a|Whether interaction between genes is better represented by synergistic or antagonistic epistasis has been a focus of experimental research in bacterial population genetics. Our previous research on evolution of modifiers of epistasis in diploid systems has indicated that the strength of positive or negative epistasis should increase provided linkage disequilibrium is maintained. Here we study a modifier of epistasis in fitness between two loci in a haploid system. Epistasis is modified in the neighborhood of a mutation-selection balance. We show that when linkage in the three-locus system is tight, an increase in the frequency of a modifier allele that induces either more negative or more positive epistasis is possible. Epistasis here can be measured on either an additive or multiplicative scale.

15342492|t|Association of the transcriptional corepressor TIF1beta with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1): an essential role for progression through differentiation.
15342492|a|The transcriptional intermediary factor 1beta (TIF1beta) is a corepressor for KRAB-domain-containing zinc finger proteins and is believed to play essential roles in cell physiology by regulating chromatin organization at specific loci through association with chromatin remodeling and histone-modifying activities and recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins. In this study, we have engineered a modified embryonal carcinoma F9 cell line (TIF1beta(HP1box/-)) expressing a mutated TIF1beta protein (TIF1beta(HP1box)) unable to interact with HP1 proteins. Phenotypic analysis of TIF1beta(HP1box/-) and TIF1beta(+/-) cells shows that TIF1beta-HP1 interaction is not required for differentiation of F9 cells into primitive endoderm-like (PrE) cells on retinoic acid (RA) treatment but is essential for further differentiation into parietal endoderm-like (PE) cells on addition of cAMP and for differentiation into visceral endoderm-like cells on treatment of vesicles with RA. Complementation experiments reveal that TIF1beta-HP1 interaction is essential only during a short window of time within early differentiating PrE cells to establish a selective transmittable competence to terminally differentiate on further cAMP inducing signal. Moreover, the expression of three endoderm-specific genes, GATA6, HNF4, and Dab2, is down-regulated in TIF1beta(HP1box/-) cells compared with wild-type cells during PrE differentiation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the interaction between TIF1beta and HP1 proteins is essential for progression through differentiation by regulating the expression of endoderm differentiation master players.

17012721|t|In vitro microtensile bond strength of four adhesives tested at the gingival and pulpal walls of Class II restorations.
17012721|a|BACKGROUND: The authors compared the microtensile bond strength of teeth restored with four adhesives at the gingival and pulpal cavity walls of Class II resin-based composite restorations. METHODS: Five pairs of extracted third molars received two Class II preparations/restorations in each tooth. The authors randomly assigned each preparation to one of four adhesive groups: Adper Scotchbond Multipurpose Dental Adhesive (SBMP) (3M ESPE, St. Paul, Minn.), Clearfil SE Bond (CFSE) (Kuraray America, New York City), Prime & Bond NT (PBNT) (Dentsply Caulk, Milford, Del.) and PQ1 (Ultradent, South Jordan, Utah). They restored the teeth and obtained microtensile specimens from each cavity wall. Specimens were tested on a testing machine until they failed. RESULTS: The mean (+/- standard deviation) bond strengths (in megapascals) were as follows: SBMP (pulpal), 36.4 (17.2); SBMP (gingival), 29.7 (15.3); CFSE (pulpal), 50.8 (13.6); CFSE (gingival), 50.2 (14.0); PBNT (pulpal), 38.3 (19.2); PBNT (gingival), 38.9 (17.7); PQ1 (pulpal), 58.7 (8.7); and PQ1 (gingival), 54.5 (18.5). A two-way analysis of variance found an adhesive effect (P < .001) but no location effect (P >.05). CONCLUSIONS: PQ1 and CFSE performed the best. The results showed no significant difference in microtensile bond strength at the gingival wall versus the pulpal wall. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Under in vitro conditions, a total-etch ethanol-based adhesive (PQ1) failed cohesively more often than did the other adhesives tested.

18275858|t|ROS and p53: a versatile partnership.
18275858|a|The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a redox-active transcription factor that organizes and directs cellular responses in the face of a variety of stresses that lead to genomic instability. One of the most important questions in the study of p53 is how selective transactivation of certain p53 target genes is achieved. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by cells as products or by-products, can function either as signaling molecules or as cellular toxicants. Cellular generation of ROS is central to redox signaling. Recent studies have revealed that each cellular concentration and distribution of p53 has a distinct cellular function and that ROS act as both an upstream signal that triggers p53 activation and a downstream factor that mediates apoptosis. Here, we examine the newly discovered role of p53 in regulating cellular ROS generation and how ROS modulate selective transactivation of p53 target genes. The focus is on interlinks between ROS and p53.

15212123|t|Mitral valve replacement and limited myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a 25-year follow-up.
15212123|a|Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is a dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract caused by septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. When the condition cannot be controlled by medical therapy the most frequently used surgical approach is left ventricular myotomy-myectomy. Mitral valve replacement (to correct another mechanism of obstruction) is another surgical option; however, its use for this condition is controversial. We review the long-term results of patients who underwent limited left ventricular myotomy-myectomy and mitral valve replacement at our institution. Eighteen patients who had hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and severe mitral insufficiency underwent surgery between 1978 and 1983: 7 were men and 11 were women (mean age, 41.8 +/- 10.5 years). Preoperatively, most of the patients (78.8%) were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. The operation consisted of a shallow myectomy of the hypertrophied septum and mitral valve replacement. One patient died in the hospital (5.5%); 3 patients died later during follow-up. The remaining 14 patients are alive and in good condition (mean follow-up, 21.9 +/- 1.7 years). Functional class improved postoperatively in all surviving patients. The mean left ventricular outflow tract gradient fell from 78.1 +/- 20.9 mmHg preoperatively to 9.4 +/- 5.2 mmHg postoperatively (P <0.001). At present, surgical treatment of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy does not include mitral valve replacement. However, our long-term results show that limited ventricular myectomy and mitral valve replacement predictably and consistently lower the left ventricular outflow tract gradient and resolve the mitral valve insufficiency.

15574594|t|Zipper-like interaction between proteins in adjacent daughter cells mediates protein localization.
15574594|a|Protein localization is crucial for cellular morphogenesis and intracellular signal transduction cascades. Here we describe an interaction between two membrane proteins expressed in different cells of the Bacillus subtilis sporangium, the mother cell protein SpoIIIAH and the forespore protein SpoIIQ. We used affinity chromatography, coimmunoprecipitation, and the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate that the extracellular domains of these proteins interact, tethering SpoIIIAH to the sporulation septum, and directing its assembly with SpoIIQ into helical arcs and foci around the forespore. We also demonstrate that this interaction can direct proteins made in the same cell to active division sites, as when SpoIIQ is made in the mother cell, it localizes to nascent septa in a SpoIIIAH-dependent manner. Both SpoIIIAH and SpoIIQ are necessary for activation of the second forespore-specific transcription factor (sigma(G)) after engulfment, and we propose that the SpoIIIAH-SpoIIQ complex contributes to a morphological checkpoint coupling sigma(G) activation to engulfment. In keeping with this hypothesis, SpoIIIAH localization depends on the first step of engulfment, septal thinning. The SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH complex reaches from the mother cell cytoplasm to the forespore cytoplasm and is ideally positioned to govern the activity of engulfment-dependent transcription factors.

16025456|t|Distribution and fate of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTp)-expressing cells in rat urinary bladder: a developmental study.
16025456|a|We examined the distribution and fate of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTp)(55-102)-immunoreactive (IR) structures in the neonatal and adult rat urinary bladder. Double-labeling studies examining CARTp with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were performed in wholemounts of urothelium or detrusor or cryostat sections of the bladder. In younger animals (postnatal day [P]1, P3), CARTp-IR cell bodies in detrusor smooth muscle were observed in large clusters ( approximately 100 cells/cluster) at the ureteral insertion and along thick bundles of nerve fibers at the bladder base. The total number of CARTp-IR cells was significantly reduced (by five-fold) at P14, and this reduced number persisted into adulthood. The decrease in the number of CARTp-expressing cells was complemented with positive staining for cleaved caspase-3, suggesting that apoptosis contributed to this decrease. At birth (P1), all CARTp-IR cells expressed the neuronal marker Hu. After birth, CARTp was expressed by some neurons (CARTp-IR, Hu-IR) that represent intramural ganglion cells and by cells that lacked a neuronal phenotype (CARTp-IR, Hu-) but did express TH. Neither of these cell populations expressed ChAT immunoreactivity in adult bladder. These cells (CARTp-IR, Hu-, TH-IR) may represent paraganglion or small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells. The percentage of colocalization of CARTp-IR and nNOS or TH was dependent on postnatal age and showed an inverse relationship. At P1, 67.1 % of CARTp-IR cells expressed nNOS immunoreactivity. Decreased colocalization was observed with increasing postnatal age. In contrast, 19.5% of CARTp-IR cells expressed TH at P1, but colocalization increased with postnatal age. The suburothelial plexus lacked CARTp-IR nerve fibers until P14, when nerve fibers with varicosities were observed in the urethra and bladder neck region. In summary, we demonstrate 1) a decrease in the number of CARTp-IR cells in rat detrusor in early postnatal development; 2) apoptotic events in the bladder during early postnatal development; 3) rostral migration of CARTp-IR cells from the ureteral insertion toward the bladder body during postnatal development; 4) the presence of different populations of CARTp-IR cells, some with and others without a neuronal phenotype; and (5) age-dependent changes in chemical coding of CARTp-IR cells with postnatal development. This study demonstrates that CARTp-IR intramural ganglia and CARTp-IR paraganglion or SIF cells exist in the postnatal and adult rat bladder, although the role of these cell types remains to be determined.

15550544|t|Human and murine inhibitory natural killer cell receptors transfer from natural killer cells to target cells.
15550544|a|Intercellular transfer of proteins across the immunological synapse is emerging as a common outcome of immune surveillance. We previously reported that target-cell MHC class I protein transfers onto natural killer (NK) cells expressing cognate killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs). We now show that, for both murine and human cells, target cells expressing inhibitory MHC class I ligands acquire cognate inhibitory NK receptors. Other cell-surface proteins, but not a cytoplasmic dye, also transferred from human NK cells to target cells across an inhibitory immunological synapse. The number of KIRs acquired from NK cells correlated with the level of expression of cognate MHC class I protein on target cells. Treatment with cytoskeletal inhibitors demonstrated that the target-cell cytoskeleton influences intercellular transfer of proteins in both directions. In contrast to constitutively expressed KIRs, a fraction of acquired KIRs could be removed by mild acid wash, demonstrating a difference between some of the acquired KIRs and constitutively expressed KIRs. An accumulation of phosphotyrosine at the location of the transferred KIRs implies a signaling capacity for NK cell proteins transferred to target cells. Thus, intercellular protein transfer between immune cells is bidirectional and could facilitate new aspects of immune cell communication.

16751286|t|Carbon monoxide contributes to hypotension-induced cerebrovascular vasodilation in piglets.
16751286|a|The gaseous compound carbon monoxide (CO) has been identified as an important endogenous biological messenger in brain and is a major component in regulation of cerebrovascular circulation in newborns. CO is produced endogenously by catabolism of heme to CO, free iron, and biliverdin during enzymatic degradation of heme by heme oxygenase (HO). The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that endogenously produced CO contributes to hypotension-induced vasodilation of cerebral arterioles. Experiments used anesthetized piglets with implanted, closed cranial windows. Topical application of the HO substrate heme-l-lysinate caused dilation of pial arterioles that was blocked by a metal porphyrin inhibitor of HO, chromium mesoporphyrin (CrMP). In normotensive piglets (arterial pressure 64 +/- 4 mmHg), CrMP did not cause vasoconstriction of pial arterioles but rather a transient dilation. Hypotension (50% of basal blood pressure) increased cerebral CO production and dilated pial arterioles from 66 +/- 2 to 92 +/- 7 microm. In hypotensive piglets, topical CrMP or intravenous tin protoporphyrin decreased cerebral CO production and produced pial arteriolar constriction to normotensive diameters. In additional experiments, because prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO) are also key dilators that can contribute to cerebrovascular dilation, we held their levels constant. NO/prostacyclin clamp was accomplished with continuous, simultaneous application of indomethacin, N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine, and minimal dilatory concentrations of iloprost and sodium nitroprusside. With constant NO and prostacyclin, the transient dilator and prolonged constrictor responses to CrMP of normotensive and hypotensive piglets, respectively, were the same as when NO and prostaglandins were not held constant. These data suggest that endogenously produced CO contributes to cerebrovascular dilation in response to reduced perfusion pressure.

15479674|t|Inhibitory actions of a high fibre diet on intestinal gas transit in healthy volunteers.
15479674|a|BACKGROUND: Fibre treatment often produces gaseous symptoms which have been attributed to fermentation by colonic bacteria with increased gas production. Effects of fibre ingestion on intestinal gas flow are unexplored. AIMS: We aimed to test the hypothesis that consumption of a high fibre diet retards gas transit. SUBJECTS: Ten healthy volunteers participated. METHODS: To investigate the effects of fibre on gas dynamics, physiological gas mixtures were jejunally perfused at 12 ml/min x 2 hours after a standard diet for seven days with and without psyllium 30 g/day in a crossover fashion. Gas was collected from an intrarectal catheter to bypass the anus and evacuation was quantified in real time using a barostat. RESULTS: On initiating gas perfusion under control conditions, an initial lag phase with no gas expulsion was observed (1129 (274) seconds). Thereafter, gas evacuation from the rectum proceeded with cumulative volumes of 1429 (108) ml by the end of the second hour. Evacuation was pulsatile with passage of 20.9 (2.5) boluses, with mean volumes of 68.2 (5.0) ml. Fibre prolonged the lag time (2265 (304) seconds; p<0.05) and reduced cumulative gas evacuation volumes (1022 (80) ml; p<0.05). Decreased gas evacuation resulted from reductions in the numbers of bolus passages (14.2 (1.1); p<0.05) but not bolus volumes (70.7 (3.4) ml; p = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of a high fibre diet retards intestinal gas transit by decreasing bolus propulsion to the rectum. Thus, in addition to increasing gas production by colonic flora, fibre ingestion may elicit gaseous symptoms by promoting gas retention.

15090652|t|Apoptosis-inducing signal sequence mutation in carbonic anhydrase IV identified in patients with the RP17 form of retinitis pigmentosa.
15090652|a|Genetic and physical mapping of the RP17 locus on 17q identified a 3.6-megabase candidate region that includes the gene encoding carbonic anhydrase IV (CA4), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is highly expressed in the choriocapillaris of the human eye. By sequencing candidate genes in this region, we identified a mutation that causes replacement of an arginine with a tryptophan (R14W) in the signal sequence of the CA4 gene at position -5 relative to the signal sequence cleavage site. This mutation was found to cosegregate with the disease phenotype in two large families and was not found in 36 unaffected family members or 100 controls. Expression of the mutant cDNA in COS-7 cells produced several findings, suggesting a mechanism by which the mutation can explain the autosomal dominant disease. In transfected COS-7 cells, the R14W mutation (i) reduced the steady-state level of carbonic anhydrase IV activity expressed by 28% due to a combination of decreased synthesis and accelerated turnover; (ii) led to up-regulation of immunoglobulin-binding protein, double-stranded RNA-regulated protein kinase-like ER kinase, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, markers of the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress; and (iii) induced apoptosis, as evidenced by annexin V binding and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining, in most cells expressing the mutant, but not the WT, protein. We suggest that a high level of expression of the mutant allele in the endothelial cells of the choriocapillaris leads to apoptosis, leading in turn to ischemia in the overlying retina and producing autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.

17635106|t|Human nuclear pregnane X receptor cross-talk with CREB to repress cAMP activation of the glucose-6-phosphatase gene.
17635106|a|The nuclear PXR (pregnane X receptor) was originally characterized as a key transcription factor that activated hepatic genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes. We have now demonstrated that PXR also represses glucagon-activated transcription of the G6Pase (glucose-6-phosphatase) gene by directly binding to CREB [CRE (cAMP-response element)-binding protein]. Adenoviral-mediated expression of human PXR (hPXR) and its activation by rifampicin strongly repressed cAMP-dependent induction of the endogenous G6Pase gene in Huh7 cells. Using the -259 bp G6Pase promoter construct in cell-based transcription assays, repression by hPXR of PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase)-mediated promoter activation was delineated to CRE sites. GST (glutathione transferase) pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays were employed to show that PXR binds directly to CREB, while gel-shift assays were used to demonstrate that this binding prevents CREB interaction with the CRE. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PXR represses the transcription of the G6Pase gene by inhibiting the DNA-binding ability of CREB. In support of this hypothesis, treatment with the mouse PXR activator PCN (pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile) repressed cAMP-dependent induction of the G6Pase gene in primary hepatocytes prepared from wild-type, but not from PXR-knockout, mice, and also in the liver of fasting wild-type, but not PXR-knockout, mice. Moreover, ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays were performed to show a decreased CREB binding to the G6Pase promoter in fasting wild-type mice after PCN treatment. Thus drug activation of PXR can repress the transcriptional activity of CREB, down-regulating gluconeogenesis.

17446863|t|Anthrax lethal toxin paralyzes actin-based motility by blocking Hsp27 phosphorylation.
17446863|a|Inhalation of anthrax causes fatal bacteremia, indicating a meager host immune response. We previously showed that anthrax lethal toxin (LT) paralyzes neutrophils, a major component of innate immunity. Here, we have found that LT also inhibits actin-based motility of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. LT inhibition of actin assembly is mediated by blockade of Hsp27 phosphorylation, and can be reproduced by treating cells with the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor SB203580. Nonphosphorylated Hsp27 inhibits Listeria actin-based motility in cell extracts, and binds to and sequesters purified actin monomers. Phosphorylation of Hsp27 reverses these effects. RNA interference knockdown of Hsp27 blocks LT inhibition of Listeria actin-based motility. Rescue with wild-type Hsp27 accelerates Listeria speed in knockdown cells, whereas introduction of Hsp27 mutants incapable of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation causes slowing down. We propose that Hsp27 facilitates actin-based motility through a phosphorylation cycle that shuttles actin monomers to regions of new actin filament assembly. Our findings provide a previously unappreciated mechanism for LT virulence, and emphasize a central role for p38 MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp27 in actin-based motility and innate immunity.

15569922|t|Single-cell FRET imaging of phosphatase activity in the Escherichia coli chemotaxis system.
15569922|a|Two-component signaling systems, in which a receptor-coupled kinase is used to control the phosphorylation level of a response regulator, are commonly used in bacteria to sense their environment. In the chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli, the receptors, and thus the kinase, are clustered on the inner cell membrane. The phosphatase of this system also is recruited to receptor clusters, but the reason for this association is not clear. By using FRET imaging of single cells, we show that in vivo the phosphatase activity is substantially larger at the cluster, indicating that the signaling source (the kinase) and the signaling sink (the phosphatase) tend to be located at the same place in the cell. When this association is disrupted, a gradient in the concentration of the phosphorylated response regulator appears, and the chemotactic response is degraded. Such colocalization is inevitable in systems in which the activity of the kinase and the phosphatase are produced by the same enzyme. Evidently, this design enables a more rapid and spatially uniform response.

15057274|t|SRF regulates Bcl-2 expression and promotes cell survival during murine embryonic development.
15057274|a|The transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) controls the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Interestingly, SRF also promotes cell survival by regulating the expression of antiapoptotic genes. In in vitro differentiating murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, SRF deficiency leads to increased apoptosis. Loss of SRF correlates with impaired expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl genes. SRF binds the Bcl-2 promoter in vivo and activates Bcl-2 transcription. Reconstituting Bcl-2 in Srf-/- ES cells rescues these cells from apoptosis, demonstrating that SRF-dependent Bcl-2 expression is critical for ES cell survival. At the multicellular level, SRF deficiency leads to impaired cavitation and reduced Bcl-2 expression in embryoid bodies (EBs) and inappropriate apoptosis in both EBs and pregastrulation mouse embryos. Thus, our data from genetic and cellular studies uncover SRF-regulated Bcl-2 expression as a novel mechanism that is important for cell survival during early murine embryogenesis.

18262490|t|CRAC motif peptide of the HIV-1 gp41 protein thins SOPC membranes and interacts with cholesterol.
18262490|a|This study uses low-angle (LAXS) and wide-angle (WAXS) X-ray synchrotron scattering, volume measurements and thin layer chromatography to determine the structure and interactions of SOPC, SOPC/cholesterol mixtures, SOPC/peptide and SOPC/cholesterol/peptide mixtures. N-acetyl-LWYIK-amide (LWYIK) represents the naturally-occurring CRAC motif segment in the pretransmembrane region of the gp41 protein of HIV-1, and N-acetyl-IWYIK-amide (IWYIK), an unnatural isomer, is used as a control. Both peptides thin the SOPC bilayer by approximately 3 A, and cause the area/unit cell (peptide+SOPC) to increase by approximately 9 A2 from the area/lipid of SOPC at 30 degrees C (67.0+/-0.9 A2). Model fitting suggests that LWYIK's average position is slightly closer to the bilayer center than IWYIK's, and both peptides are just inside of the phosphate headgroup. Both peptides increase the wide-angle spacing d of SOPC without cholesterol, whereas with 50% cholesterol LWYIK increases d but IWYIK decreases d. TLC shows that LWYIK is more hydrophobic than IWYIK; this difference persists in peptide/SOPC 1:9 mole ratio mixtures. Both peptides counteract the chain ordering effect of cholesterol to roughly the same degree, and both decrease KC, the bending modulus, thus increasing the SOPC membrane fluidity. Both peptides nucleate crystals of cholesterol, but the LWYIK-induced crystals are weaker and dissolve more easily.

15141166|t|Functional integration of the histone acetyltransferase MOF into the dosage compensation complex.
15141166|a|Dosage compensation in flies involves doubling the transcription of genes on the single male X chromosome to match the combined expression level of the two female X chromosomes. Crucial for this activation is the acetylation of histone H4 by the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) MOF. In male cells, MOF resides in a complex (dosage compensation complex, DCC) with MSL proteins and noncoding roX RNA. Previous studies suggested that MOF's localization to the X chromosome was largely RNA-mediated. We now found that contact of the MOF chromo-related domain with roX RNA plays only a minor role in correct targeting to the X chromosome in vivo. Instead, a strong, direct interaction between a conserved MSL1 domain and a zinc finger within MOF's HAT domain is crucial. The functional consequences of this interaction were studied in vitro. Simultaneous contact of MOF with MSL1 and MSL3 led to its recruitment to chromatin, a dramatic stimulation of HAT activity and to improved substrate specificity. Activation of MOF's HAT activity upon integration into the DCC may serve to restrict the critical histone modification to the male X chromosome.

18429929|t|Rab14 regulates apical targeting in polarized epithelial cells.
18429929|a|Epithelial cells display distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains, and maintenance of this asymmetry is essential to the function of epithelial tissues. Polarized delivery of apical and basolateral membrane proteins from the trans Golgi network (TGN) and/or endosomes to the correct domain requires specific cytoplasmic machinery to control the sorting, budding and fission of vesicles. However, the molecular machinery that regulates polarized delivery of apical proteins remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that the small guanosine triphosphatase Rab14 is involved in the apical targeting pathway. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis and glutathione S-transferase pull down, we show that Rab14 interacts with apical membrane proteins and localizes to the TGN and apical endosomes. Overexpression of the GDP mutant form of Rab14 (S25N) induces an enlargement of the TGN and vesicle accumulation around Golgi membranes. Moreover, expression of Rab14-S25N results in mislocalization of the apical raft-associated protein vasoactive intestinal peptide/MAL to the basolateral domain but does not disrupt basolateral targeting or recycling. These data suggest that Rab14 specifically regulates delivery of cargo from the TGN to the apical domain.

18041719|t|Pre-treatment of synthetic elastomeric scaffolds by cardiac fibroblasts improves engineered heart tissue.
18041719|a|Native myocardium consists of several cell types, of which approximately one-third are myocytes and most of the nonmyocytes are fibroblasts. By analogy with monolayer culture in which fibroblasts were removed to prevent overgrowth, early attempts to engineer myocardium utilized cell populations enriched for cardiac myocytes (CMs; approximately 80-90% of total cells). We hypothesized that the pre-treatment of synthetic elastomeric scaffolds with cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) will enhance the functional assembly of the engineered cardiac constructs by creating an environment supportive of cardiomyocyte attachment and function. Cells isolated from neonatal rat ventricles were prepared to form three distinct populations: rapidly plating cells identified as CFs, slowly plating cells identified as CMs, and unseparated initial population of cells (US). The cell fractions (3 x 10(6) cells total) were seeded into poly(glycerol sebacate) scaffolds (highly porous discs, 5 mm in diameter x 2-mm thick) using Matrigeltrade mark, either separately (CM or CF), concurrently (US), or sequentially (CF pre-treatment followed by CM culture, CF + CM), and cultured in spinner flasks. The CF + CM group had the highest amplitude of contraction and the lowest excitation threshold, superior DNA content, and higher glucose consumption rate. The CF + CM group exhibited compact 100- to 200-mum thick layers of elongated myocytes aligned in parallel over layers of collagen-producing fibroblasts, while US and CM groups exhibited scattered and poorly elongated myocytes. The sequential co-culture of CF and CM on a synthetic elastomer scaffold thus created an environment supportive of cardiomyocyte attachment, differentiation, and contractile function, presumably due to scaffold conditioning by cultured fibroblasts. When implanted over the infarcted myocardium in a nude rat model, cell-free poly(glycerol sebacate) remained at the ventricular wall after 2 weeks of in vivo, and was vascularized.

15031265|a|Mutant analysis has been tremendously successful in deciphering the genetics of plant development. However, less is known about the molecular basis of morphological variation within species, which is caused by naturally occurring alleles. In this study, we succeeded in isolating a novel regulator of root growth by exploiting natural genetic variation in the model plant Arabidopsis. Quantitative trait locus analysis of a cross between isogenized accessions revealed that a single locus is responsible for approximately 80% of the variance of the observed difference in root length. This gene, named BREVIS RADIX (BRX), controls the extent of cell proliferation and elongation in the growth zone of the root tip. We isolated BRX by positional cloning. BRX is a member of a small group of highly conserved genes, the BRX gene family, which is only found in multicellular plants. Analyses of Arabidopsis single and double mutants suggest that BRX is the only gene of this family with a role in root development. The BRX protein is nuclear localized and activates transcription in a heterologous yeast system, indicating that BRX family proteins represent a novel class of transcription factors. Thus, we have identified a novel regulatory factor controlling quantitative aspects of root growth.

17982768|t|Implications of a large global root biomass for carbon sink estimates and for soil carbon dynamics.
17982768|a|Recent evidence suggests that significantly more plant carbon (C) is stored below ground than existing estimates indicate. This study explores the implications for biome C pool sizes and global C fluxes. It predicts a root C pool of at least 268 Pg, 68% larger than previously thought. Although still a low-precision estimate (owing to the uncertainties of biome-scale measurements), a global root C pool this large implies stronger land C sinks, particularly in tropical and temperate forests, shrubland and savanna. The land sink predicted from revised C inventories is 2.7 Pg yr(-1). This is 0.1 Pg yr(-1) larger than current estimates, within the uncertainties associated with global C fluxes, but conflicting with a smaller sink (2.4 Pg yr(-1)) estimated from C balance. Sink estimates derived from C inventories and C balance match, however, if global soil C is assumed to be declining by 0.4-0.7% yr(-1), rates that agree with long-term regional rates of soil C loss. Either possibility, a stronger land C sink or widespread soil C loss, argues that these features of the global C cycle should be reassessed to improve the accuracy and precision of C flux and pool estimates at both global and biome scales.

19035277|t|Chemopreventive effects of heat-processed Panax quinquefolius root on human breast cancer cells.
19035277|a|BACKGROUND: Former studies have shown that extract from American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) may possess certain antiproliferative effects on cancer cells. In this study, the chemical constituents of both untreated and heat-processed American ginseng and their antiproliferative activities on human breast cancer cells were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: American ginseng roots were steamed at 120 degrees C for 1 h or 2 h. The major ginsenosides in the two steamed and in the unsteamed extracts were quantitatively determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The antiproliferative activities of these extracts and individual ginsenosides on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were assayed using the MTS method. The effects of the extracts and the ginsenosides on the induction of cell apoptosis, the expression of cyclins A and D1, and cell cycle arrest were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to the untreated extract, heat-processing reduced the content of ginsenosides Rb1, Re, Rc and Rd, and increased the content of Rg2 and Rg3. After 2 h steaming, the percent content of ginsenoside Rg3 was increased from 0.06% to 5.9%. Compared to the unsteamed extract, the 2 h steamed extract significantly increased the antiproliferative activity and significantly reduced the number of viable cells. The steamed extract also significantly reduced the expression of cyclin A and cyclin D1. The cell cycle assay showed that the steamed extract and ginsenoside Rg3 arrested cancer cells in G1-phase. CONCLUSION: Heat-processing of American ginseng root significantly increases antiproliferative activity and influences the cell cycle profile.

15861130|t|PIP2 signaling in lipid domains: a critical re-evaluation.
15861130|a|Microdomains such as rafts are considered as scaffolds for phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PIP2) signaling, enabling PIP2 to selectively regulate different processes in the cell. Enrichment of PIP2 in microdomains was based on cholesterol-depletion and detergent-extraction studies. Here we show that two distinct phospholipase C-coupled receptors (those for neurokinin A and endothelin) share the same, homogeneously distributed PIP2 pool at the plasma membrane, even though the neurokinin A receptor is localized to microdomains and is cholesterol dependent in its PIP2 signaling whereas the endothelin receptor is not. Our experiments further indicate that detergent treatment causes PIP2 clustering and that cholesterol depletion interferes with basal, ligand-independent recycling of the neurokinin A receptor, thereby providing alternative explanations for the enrichment of PIP2 in detergent-insoluble membrane fractions and for the cholesterol dependency of PIP2 breakdown, respectively.

17473174|t|Lin-28 binds IGF-2 mRNA and participates in skeletal myogenesis by increasing translation efficiency.
17473174|a|Lin-28 is a highly conserved, RNA-binding, microRNA-regulated protein that is involved in regulation of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans. In mammals, Lin-28 is stage-specifically expressed in embryonic muscle, neurons, and epithelia, as well as in embryonic carcinoma cells, but is suppressed in most adult tissues, with the notable exception of skeletal and cardiac muscle. The specific function and mechanism of action of Lin-28 are not well understood. Here we used loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays in cultured myoblasts to show that expression of Lin-28 is essential for skeletal muscle differentiation in mice. In order to elucidate the specific function of Lin-28, we used a combination of biochemical and functional assays, which revealed that, in differentiating myoblasts, Lin-28 binds to the polysomes and increases the efficiency of protein synthesis. An important target of Lin-28 is IGF-2, a crucial growth and differentiation factor for muscle tissue. Interaction of Lin-28 with translation initiation complexes in skeletal myoblasts and in the embryonic carcinoma cell line P19 was confirmed by localization of Lin-28 to the stress granules, temporary structures that contain stalled mRNA-protein translation complexes. Our results unravel novel mechanisms of translational regulation in skeletal muscle and suggest that Lin-28 performs the role of "translational enhancer" in embryonic and adult cells and tissues.

16253916|a|We report the first clinical application of electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI), a new, noninvasive imaging modality for arrhythmias, in an athlete with focal ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating from a left ventricular (LV) diverticulum. A reconstructed map of the epicardial activation sequence during a single premature ventricular complex (PVC) of an identical QRS morphology to the clinical VT, generated from 224-electrode body surface ECGs and a chest CT (ECGI), localized the PVC to the site of the diverticulum. This correlated with subsequent maps obtained using standard techniques. We describe the first case that used ECGI to guide diagnosis and therapy of a clinical tachyarrhythmia.

18953109|t|Alzheimer's disease: cerebrovascular dysfunction, oxidative stress, and advanced clinical therapies.
18953109|a|Many lines of independent research have provided convergent evidence regarding oxidative stress, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical studies spurred by these findings engage basic and clinical communities with tangible results regarding molecular targets and patient outcomes. Focusing on recent progress in characterizing age-related diseases specifically highlights oxidative stress and mechanisms for therapeutic action in AD. Oxidative stress has been investigated independently for its relationship with aging and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and provides evidence of shared pathophysiology across these conditions. The mechanisms by which oxidative stress impacts the cerebrovasculature and blood-brain barrier are of critical importance for evaluating antioxidant therapies. Clinical research has identified homocysteine as a relevant risk factor for AD and dementia; basic research into molecular mechanisms associated with homocysteine metabolism has revealed important findings. Oxidative stress has direct implications in the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases and careful scrutiny of oxidative stress in the CNS has therapeutic implications for future clinical trials. These mechanisms of dysfunction, acting independently or in concert, through oxidative stress may provide the research community with concise working concepts and promising new directions to yield new methods for evaluation and treatment of dementia and AD.

15538383|t|Polyamines regulate their synthesis by inducing expression and blocking degradation of ODC antizyme.
15538383|a|Polyamines are essential organic cations with multiple cellular functions. Their synthesis is controlled by a feedback regulation whose main target is ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. In mammals, ODC has been shown to be inhibited and targeted for ubiquitin-independent degradation by ODC antizyme (AZ). The synthesis of mammalian AZ was reported to involve a polyamine-induced ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. High levels of polyamine therefore inhibit new synthesis of polyamines by inducing ODC degradation. We identified a previously unrecognized sequence in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoding an orthologue of mammalian AZ. We show that synthesis of yeast AZ (Oaz1) involves polyamine-regulated frameshifting as well. Degradation of yeast ODC by the proteasome depends on Oaz1. Using this novel model system for polyamine regulation, we discovered another level of its control. Oaz1 itself is subject to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by the proteasome. Degradation of Oaz1, however, is inhibited by polyamines. We propose a model, in which polyamines inhibit their ODC-mediated biosynthesis by two mechanisms, the control of Oaz1 synthesis and inhibition of its degradation.

17233630|t|Paxillin family members function as Csk-binding proteins that regulate Lyn activity in human and murine platelets.
17233630|a|SFKs (Src family kinases) contribute importantly to platelet function in haemostasis. SFK activity is controlled by Csk (C-terminal Src kinase), which phosphorylates a C-terminal tyrosine residue on SFKs, resulting in inhibition of SFK activity. Csk is recruited to sites of SFK activity by tyrosine-phosphorylated Csk-binding proteins. Paxillin, a multidomain adaptor protein, has been shown to act as a Csk-binding protein and to inhibit Src activity during growth factor signalling. Human platelets express Hic-5, a member of the paxillin family; however, its ability to act as a Csk-binding protein has not been characterized. We sought to identify and characterize the ability of paxillin family members to act as Csk-binding proteins during platelet activation. We found that murine and human platelets differ in the complement of paxillin family members expressed. Human platelets express Hic-5, whereas murine platelets express paxillin and leupaxin in addition to Hic-5. In aggregating human platelets, Hic-5 was tyrosine phosphorylated and recruited Csk via its SH2 domains. In aggregating murine platelets, however, Csk bound preferentially to paxillin, even though both paxillin and Hic-5 were abundantly present and became tyrosine phosphorylated. The SFK Lyn, but not Src or Fyn, was associated with paxillin family members in resting and aggregated human and murine platelets. Lyn, however, was phosphorylated on its C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine residue only following platelet aggregation, which was coincident with recruitment of Csk to paxillin and/or Hic-5 in a manner dependent on prior alpha(IIb)beta3 engagement. These observations support the notion that Hic-5 and paxillin function as negative feedback regulators of SFKs in aggregated platelets and that, when both are present, paxillin is preferentially used.

17438284|t|Mechanism of the myosin catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP as rationalized by molecular modeling.
17438284|a|The intrinsic chemical reaction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis catalyzed by myosin is modeled by using a combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methodology that achieves a near ab initio representation of the entire model. Starting with coordinates derived from the heavy atoms of the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank ID code 1VOM) in which myosin is bound to the ATP analog ADP.VO(4)(-), a minimum-energy path is found for the transformation ATP + H(2)O --> ADP + P(i) that is characterized by two distinct events: (i) a low activation-energy cleavage of the P(gamma) O(betagamma) bond and separation of the gamma-phosphate from ADP and (ii) the formation of the inorganic phosphate as a consequence of proton transfers mediated by two water molecules and assisted by the Glu-459-Arg-238 salt bridge of the protein. The minimum-energy model of the enzyme-substrate complex features a stable hydrogen-bonding network in which the lytic water is positioned favorably for a nucleophilic attack of the ATP gamma-phosphate and for the transfer of a proton to stably bound second water. In addition, the P(gamma) O(betagamma) bond has become significantly longer than in the unbound state of the ATP and thus is predisposed to cleavage. The modeled transformation is viewed as the part of the overall hydrolysis reaction occurring in the closed enzyme pocket after ATP is bound tightly to myosin and before conformational changes preceding release of inorganic phosphate.

15302933|t|The membrane actions of estrogens can potentiate their lordosis behavior-facilitating genomic actions.
15302933|a|The membrane actions of estrogens can facilitate their genomic actions. To determine whether this facilitation bears on CNS mechanisms for estrogen-dependent behaviors, ovariectomized rats were subjected to a two-pulse treatment of estrogen directly in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus. Two days later, each rat was given progesterone and then tested for lordosis behavior, the induction of which requires the genomic actions of estrogen. When estrogen was given in both pulses (15 min to 2 h duration, and 5 h apart) lordosis was induced. Based on results from studies on neuroblastoma cells, we hypothesized that the membrane actions of estrogen in the first pulse would potentiate the genomic actions of estrogen in the second. This hypothesis was confirmed with the use of a membrane-impermeable estrogen. However, surprisingly, the order of the pulses could be reversed and still achieve lordosis behavior induction. Finally, activators of protein kinase A or PKC were effective substitutes for the membrane-limited pulse of estrogen. Thus, estrogen-induced membrane actions in the hypothalamus can potentiate its lordosis-inducing genomic actions on behavior and may be mediated by signaling pathways involving the activation of protein kinase A and PKC.

19805135|t|An unexpected role for TASK-3 potassium channels in network oscillations with implications for sleep mechanisms and anesthetic action.
19805135|a|TASK channels are acid-sensitive and anesthetic-activated members of the family of two-pore-domain potassium channels. We have made the surprising discovery that the genetic ablation of TASK-3 channels eliminates a specific type of theta oscillation in the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) resembling type II theta (4-9 Hz), which is thought to be important in processing sensory stimuli before initiating motor activity. In contrast, ablation of TASK-1 channels has no effect on theta oscillations. Despite the absence of type II theta oscillations in the TASK-3 knockout (KO) mice, the related type I theta, which has certain neuronal pathways in common and is involved in exploratory behavior, is unaffected. In addition to the absence of type II theta oscillations, the TASK-3 KO animals show marked alterations in both anesthetic sensitivity and natural sleep behavior. Their sensitivity to halothane, a potent activator of TASK channels, is greatly reduced, whereas their sensitivity to cyclopropane, which does not activate TASK-3 channels, is unchanged. The TASK-3 KO animals exhibit a slower progression from their waking to sleeping states and, during their sleeping period, their sleep episodes as well as their REM theta oscillations are more fragmented. These results imply a previously unexpected role for TASK-3 channels in the cellular mechanisms underlying these behaviors and suggest that endogenous modulators of these channels may regulate theta oscillations.

17560621|t|Isolation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies elicited by trimeric HIV-1 Env gp140 protein immunogens.
17560621|a|Eleven anti-HIV Env monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were isolated from mice immunized with soluble Env proteins derived from the clade B Env, SF162, or DeltaV2 (a derivative of SF162 lacking the V2 loop). All six anti-gp120 MAbs studied, neutralized SF162 and their activities were dependent by the glycosylation patterns of the V1, V2 or V3 loops. Only one anti-gp120 MAb (an anti-V3 MAb) displayed cross-neutralizing activity, which was influenced by the type of V1 loop present on the target heterologous viruses. None of the five anti-gp41 MAbs studied displayed anti-SF162 neutralizing activity. Our studies indicate that the current limitation of soluble HIV Env gp140 immunogens to elicit robust cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses is not only due to the elicitation of high titers of homologous antibodies but also due to the elicitation of antibodies whose epitopes are naturally occluded, or not present, on the virion-associated Env.

15070753|t|Genome-wide identification of DNaseI hypersensitive sites using active chromatin sequence libraries.
15070753|a|Comprehensive identification of sequences that regulate transcription is one of the major goals of genome biology. Focal alteration in chromatin structure in vivo, detectable through hypersensitivity to DNaseI and other nucleases, is the sine qua non of a diverse cast of transcriptional regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, and locus control regions. We developed an approach for genome-scale identification of DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) via isolation and cloning of in vivo DNaseI cleavage sites to create libraries of active chromatin sequences (ACSs). Here, we describe analysis of >61,000 ACSs derived from erythroid cells. We observed peaks in the density of ACSs at the transcriptional start sites of known genes at non-gene-associated CpG islands, and, to a lesser degree, at evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences. Peaks in ACS density paralleled the distribution of DNaseI HSs. ACSs and DNaseI HSs were distributed between both expressed and nonexpressed genes, suggesting that a large proportion of genes reside within open chromatin domains. The results permit a quantitative approximation of the distribution of HSs and classical cis-regulatory sequences in the human genome.

17543011|t|In or out? Methodological considerations for including and excluding findings from a meta-analysis of predictors of antiretroviral adherence in HIV-positive women.
17543011|a|AIM: This paper is a discussion detailing the decisions concerning whether to include or exclude findings from a meta-analysis of report of quantitative studies of antiretroviral adherence in HIV-positive women. BACKGROUND: Publication constraints and the absence of reflexivity as a criterion for validity in, and reporting of, quantitative research preclude detailing the many judgements made in the course of a meta-analysis. Yet, such an accounting would assist researchers better to address the unique challenges to meta-analysis presented by the bodies of research they have targeted for review, and to show the subjectivity, albeit disciplined, that characterizes the meta-analytic process. DATA SOURCES: Data were 29 published and unpublished studies on antiretroviral adherence in HIV-positive women of any race/ethnicity, class, or nationality living in the United States of America. The studies were retrieved between June 2005 and January 2006 using 40 databases. REVIEW METHODS: Findings were included if they met the statistical assumptions of meta-analysis, including: (1) normal distribution of observations; (2) homogeneity of variances; and (3) independence of observations. RESULTS: Relevant studies and findings were excluded because of issues related to differences in study design, different operationalizations of dependent and independent variables, multiple cuts from common longitudinal data sets, and presentation of unadjusted and adjusted findings. These reasons led to the exclusion of 73% of unadjusted relationships and 87% of adjusted relationships from our data set, leaving few findings to synthesize. CONCLUSION: Decisions made during research synthesis studies may result in more information losses than gains, thereby obliging researchers to find ways to preserve findings that are potentially valuable for practice.

15241471|t|Structural basis for L27 domain-mediated assembly of signaling and cell polarity complexes.
15241471|a|L27 is a protein-binding domain that can assemble essential proteins for signaling and cell polarity into complexes by interacting in a heterodimeric manner. One of these protein complexes is the PATJ/PALS1/Crumbs tripartite complex, which is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. To reveal the structural basis underlining the obligate heterodimerization, we have determined the crystal structure of the PALS1-L27N/PATJ-L27 heterodimer complex. Each L27 domain is composed of three helices. The two L27 domains heterodimerize by building a compact structure consisting of a four-helix bundle formed by the first two helices of each L27 domain and one coiled-coil formed by the third helix of each domain. The large hydrophobic packing interactions contributed by all the helices of both L27 domains predominantly drive the heterodimer formation, which is likely to be a general feature of L27 domains. Combined with mutational studies, we can begin to understand the structural basis for the specificity of L27 binding pairs. Our results provide unique insights into L27 domain heterodimer complex, which is critical for cell polarization.

During B. anthracis infections, PA secreted by bacteria binds to membrane receptors of susceptible cells, is cleaved proteolytically, attaches to lethal factor or edema factor, undergoes oligomerization and internalization, and transports its toxin partners to acidic endosomes where they are released into the cytosol. To identify specific host functions that mediate these events, we used RNA encoded by a lentivirus-based library of approximately 40,000 human ESTs to inactivate chromosomal genes in a human cell population, and we isolated clones that survived PA-dependent toxin-induced death. This phenotypic screen and subsequent analysis identified ARAP3, which is a phosphoinositide-binding protein implicated previously in membrane vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal organization, as a mammalian host-cell gene that is essential for normal anthrax toxicity. ARAP3 deficiency produced by antisense expression of an ARAP3 EST impaired entry of PA and its bound toxigenic moieties into both human and mouse cells, resulting in reduced toxin sensitivity. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of antisense EST libraries for global chromosomal gene inactivation, establish the practicality of loss-of-function phenotypic screens for the identification of genomic loci required for pathogen effects in mammalian cells, and reveal an important role for ARAP3 in cellular internalization of anthrax toxin.

18437000|t|Alcohol consumption and the CAGE questionnaire in Korean adults: results from the Second Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
18437000|a|We evaluated alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems in Korean adults by evaluating alcohol consumption and responses to the CAGE questionnaire obtained from the second Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The age-adjusted prevalence of males who consumed 0, 0.1-20, 20.1-40, or >40 g/day of alcohol were 28.0, 51.5, 12.5, and 8.0%, respectively; 26.9% of male drinkers were CAGE-positive (> or =2 affirmative responses to the CAGE). The age-adjusted prevalence of females who consumed 0, 0.1-10, 10.1-20, or >20 g/day of alcohol were 67.7, 26.6, 3.9, and 1.8%; 11.9% of female drinkers were CAGE-positive. The risk factors for high alcohol consumption were old age, low education level, smoking, and drinking onset at young ages in male drinkers, whereas low education level and smoking in female drinkers. The risk factors for a positive CAGE were young age, marriage, low education level, smoking, high amount of alcohol consumed on a single occasion, and high drinking frequency in male drinkers, whereas high household income, ex-smoking, high amount of alcohol consumed on a single occasion, and high drinking frequency in female drinkers. Our results suggest that high alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems in Korean adults are not negligible and require intervention.

18234217|t|Hydrodynamic studies on defined heterochromatin fragments support a 30-nm fiber having six nucleosomes per turn.
18234217|a|We have compared the physical properties of a 15.51-kb constitutive heterochromatin segment and a 16.17-kb facultative heterochromatin segment that form part of the chicken beta-globin locus. These segments were excised from an avian erythroleukemia cell line by restriction enzyme digestion and released from the nucleus, thus allowing measurement of the sedimentation coefficients by use of calibrated sucrose gradients. A determination of the buoyant density of the cross-linked particle in CsCl led to the total mass of the particles and their frictional coefficients, f. Despite the slight differences in nucleosome density, the measured value of f for both fragments was consistent with a rodlike particle having a diameter of 33-45 nm and a length corresponding to approximately six to seven nucleosomes per 11-nm turn. At higher ionic strengths we found no evidence of any abrupt conformational change, demonstrating that these chromatin fragments released from the nucleus did not assume the more compact conformations recently described for some reconstituted structures.

18392951|t|Bicyclol: a novel antihepatitis drug with hepatic heat shock protein 27/70-inducing activity and cytoprotective effects in mice.
18392951|a|Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are the best-known endogenous factors that protect against cell injury under various pathological conditions and that can be induced by various physical, chemical, and biological stressors. New research seeks to discover a compound that is clinically safe and can induce the accumulation of HSPs in patients. This paper reports that the oral administration of three doses of bicyclol, a novel antihepatitis drug, induced hepatic HSP27 and HSP70 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and that bicyclol treatment stimulated heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) activation in mice. The inducing effects of bicyclol on HSP27, HSP70 and HSF1 were all blocked by quercetin, an inhibitor of HSP biosynthesis. The cytoprotective effect of HSP27/70 induced by bicyclol against hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen (AP) was assessed in mice. The prior administration of bicyclol markedly suppressed AP-induced liver injury as indicated by the reduction in the elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, in liver necrosis, in the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria, as well as in hepatic deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation in mice. However, all the above actions of bicyclol against AP-induced mouse liver injuries were significantly attenuated by quercetin. This is the first report to show that bicyclol induces hepatic HSP27/70 expression via activation of HSF1 and that the cytoprotective action of bicyclol against liver injury is mediated by its induction of HSP27/70. These results provide new evidence for elucidating the mechanism of the hepatoprotective action of bicyclol in animals and patients.

18337168|t|EEG indices of tonic pain-related activity in the somatosensory cortices.
18337168|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify EEG features that index pain-related cortical activity, and to identify factors that can mask the pain-related EEG features and/or produce features that can be misinterpreted as pain-specific. METHODS: The EEG was recorded during three conditions presented in counterbalanced order: a tonic cold pain condition, and pain anticipation and arithmetic control conditions. The EEG was also recorded while the subjects made a wincing facial expression to estimate the contribution of scalp EMG artifacts to the pain-related EEG features. RESULTS: Alpha amplitudes decreased over the contralateral temporal scalp and increased over the posterior scalp during the cold pain condition. There was an increase in gamma band activity during the cold pain condition at most electrode locations that was due to EMG artifacts. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in alpha over the contralateral temporal scalp during cold pain is consistent with pain-related activity in the primary somatosensory cortex and/or the somatosensory association areas located in the parietal operculum and/or insula. This study also identified factors that might mask the pain-related EEG features and/or generate EEG features that could be misinterpreted as being pain-specific. These include (but are not limited to) an increase in alpha generated in the visual cortex that results from attention being drawn towards the pain; the widespread increase in gamma band activity that results from scalp EMG generated by the facial expressions that often accompany pain; and the possibility that non-specific changes in the EEG over time mask the pain-related EEG features when the pain and control conditions are given in the same order across subjects. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identified several factors that need to be controlled and/or isolated in order to successfully record EEG features that index pain-related activity in the somatosensory cortices.

18682497|t|Role of N-linked oligosaccharides in the biosynthetic processing of the cystic fibrosis membrane conductance regulator.
18682497|a|The epithelial chloride channel CFTR is a glycoprotein that is modified by two N-linked oligosaccharides. The most common mutant CFTR protein in patients with cystic fibrosis, DeltaF508, is misfolded and retained by ER quality control. As oligosaccharide moieties of glycoproteins are known to mediate interactions with ER lectin chaperones, we investigated the role of N-linked glycosylation in the processing of wild-type and DeltaF508 CFTR. We found that N-glycosylation and ER lectin interactions are not major determinants of trafficking of wild-type and DeltaF508 from the ER to the plasma membrane. Unglycosylated CFTR, generated by removal of glycosylation sites or treatment of cells with the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, did not bind calnexin, but did traffic to the cell surface and exhibited chloride channel activity. Most importantly, unglycosylated DeltaF508 CFTR still could not escape quality control in the early secretory pathway and remained associated with the ER. However, the absence of N-linked oligosaccharides did reduce the stability of wild-type CFTR, causing significantly more-rapid turnover in post-ER compartments. Surprisingly, the individual N-linked carbohydrates do not play equivalent roles and modulate the fate of the wild-type protein in different ways in its early biosynthetic pathway.

15044703|t|Complex molecular architecture of beet yellows virus particles.
15044703|a|Closteroviruses possess exceptionally long filamentous virus particles that mediate protection and active transport of the genomic RNA within infected plants. These virions are composed of a long "body" and short "tail" whose principal components are the major and minor capsid proteins, respectively. Here we use biochemical, genetic, and ultrastructural analyses to dissect the molecular composition and architecture of particles of beet yellows virus, a closterovirus. We demonstrate that the virion tails encapsidate the 5'-terminal, approximately 650-nt-long, part of the viral RNA. In addition to the minor capsid protein, the viral Hsp70-homolog, 64-kDa protein, and 20-kDa protein are also incorporated into the virion tail. Atomic force microscopy of virions revealed that the tail possesses a striking, segmented morphology with the tip segment probably being built of 20-kDa protein. The unexpectedly complex structure of closterovirus virions has important mechanistic and functional implications that may also apply to other virus families.

16275491|a|The predictive value of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and catecholamines in terms of any subsequent development of cardiovascular disease was investigated. Systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP, HR, epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) were measured three times a year in 1980, 1984, and 1989 on 20 clinically healthy subjects, 18 patients with 'essential hypertension', and 22 patients with angina pectoris. Of the 22 patients in the latter group, 15 died during a 2-year follow-up (1990-1991). Each individual data series was analyzed by single cosinor to assess the circannual variation. Results were summarized by population-mean cosinor for each group. Parameter tests were used to compare the circannual rhythm characteristics among the different patient groups. A circannual rhythm was invariably demonstrated on a group basis (P < 0.05). Differences in MESOR and/or circannual amplitude were found among the different groups. In particular, patients with angina pectoris who will die within the 2-year follow-up differ in terms of their E and NE from all other patient groups, a difference already detected at the beginning of the study, more than 10 years before they die. A similar separation is not achieved in terms of BP or HR.

15549137|t|The CDK regulates repair of double-strand breaks by homologous recombination during the cell cycle.
15549137|a|DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are dangerous lesions that can lead to genomic instability and cell death. Eukaryotic cells repair DSBs either by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or by homologous recombination. We investigated the ability of yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to repair a single, chromosomal DSB by recombination at different stages of the cell cycle. We show that cells arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle restrict homologous recombination, but are able to repair the DSB by NHEJ. Furthermore, we demonstrate that recombination ability does not require duplicated chromatids or passage through S phase, and is controlled at the resection step by Clb-CDK activity.

15064396|t|Beyond sensory images: Object-based representation in the human ventral pathway.
15064396|a|We investigated whether the topographically organized, category-related patterns of neural response in the ventral visual pathway are a representation of sensory images or a more abstract representation of object form that is not dependent on sensory modality. We used functional MRI to measure patterns of response evoked during visual and tactile recognition of faces and manmade objects in sighted subjects and during tactile recognition in blind subjects. Results showed that visual and tactile recognition evoked category-related patterns of response in a ventral extrastriate visual area in the inferior temporal gyrus that were correlated across modality for manmade objects. Blind subjects also demonstrated category-related patterns of response in this "visual" area, and in more ventral cortical regions in the fusiform gyrus, indicating that these patterns are not due to visual imagery and, furthermore, that visual experience is not necessary for category-related representations to develop in these cortices. These results demonstrate that the representation of objects in the ventral visual pathway is not simply a representation of visual images but, rather, is a representation of more abstract features of object form.

19805075|t|Differing requirements for actin and myosin by plant viruses for sustained intercellular movement.
19805075|a|The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in the intra- and intercellular movement of a growing number of plant and animal viruses. However, the range of viruses influenced by actin for movement and the mechanism of this transport are poorly understood. Here we determine the importance of microfilaments and myosins for the sustained intercellular movement of a group of RNA-based plant viruses. We demonstrate that the intercellular movement of viruses from different genera [tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), potato virus X (PVX), tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV)], is inhibited by disruption of microfilaments. Surprisingly, turnip vein-clearing virus (TVCV), a virus from the same genus as TMV, did not require intact microfilaments for normal spread. To investigate the molecular basis for this difference we compared the subcellular location of GFP fusions to the 126-kDa protein and the homologous 125-kDa protein from TMV and TVCV, respectively. The 126-kDa protein formed numerous large cytoplasmic inclusions associated with microfilaments, whereas the 125-kDa protein formed few small possible inclusions, none associated with microfilaments. The dependence of TMV, PVX, and TBSV on intact microfilaments for intercellular movement led us to investigate the role of myosin motors in this process. Virus-induced gene silencing of the Nicotiana benthamiana myosin XI-2 gene, but not three other myosins, inhibited only TMV movement. These results indicate that RNA viruses have evolved differently in their requirements for microfilaments and the associated myosin motors, in a manner not correlated with predicted phylogeny.

17223796|t|The mechanism by which molecules containing the HIV gp41 core-binding motif HXXNPF inhibit HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated syncytium formation.
17223796|a|The HIV-1 gp41 (glycoprotein 41) core plays a critical role in fusion between the viral and target cell membranes. We previously identified a gp41 core-binding motif, HXXNPF, by screening the phage display peptide libraries. In the present study, we elucidated the mechanism of action of HXXNPF motif-containing molecules of different sizes, including the phage clone L7.8 (a selected positive phage clone), L7.8-g3p* (a 10-kDa fragment of the gene 3 protein) and JCH-4 (a peptide containing 13 residues of L7.8-g3p*), regarding their respective binding abilities to the six-helix bundle and inhibition on syncytium formation at different temperatures. We found that all of the HXXNPF motif-containing molecules could bind to the gp41 core, and that their binding sites may be located in the N-helix domain. L7.8-g3p* and JCH-4 effectively inhibited HIV-1 Env (envelope glycoprotein)-mediated syncytium formation at 37 degrees C, while the phage clone L7.8 showed no inhibition under the same conditions. However, at suboptimal temperature (31.5 degrees C), all of these HXXNPF motif-containing molecules were capable of inhibiting syncytium formation. These results suggest that these HXXNPF motif-containing molecules mainly bind to the gp41 core and stop the fusion process mediated by the fusion-active core, resulting in inhibition of HIV-1 fusion and entry. The HXXNPF motif-containing molecules may be used as probes for studying the role of the HIV-1 gp41 core in the late stage of the membrane-fusion process.

17382583|t|Human and automated detection of high-frequency oscillations in clinical intracranial EEG recordings.
17382583|a|OBJECTIVE: Recent studies indicate that pathologic high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are signatures of epileptogenic brain. Automated tools are required to characterize these events. We present a new algorithm tuned to detect HFOs from 30 to 85 Hz, and validate it against human expert electroencephalographers. METHODS: We randomly selected 28 3-min single-channel epochs of intracranial EEG (IEEG) from two patients. Three human reviewers and three automated detectors marked all records to identify candidate HFOs. Subsequently, human reviewers verified all markings. RESULTS: A total of 1330 events were collectively identified. The new method presented here achieved 89.7% accuracy against a consensus set of human expert markings. A one-way ANOVA determined no difference between the mean F-measures of the human reviewers and automated algorithm. Human kappa statistics (mean kappa=0.38) demonstrated marginal identification consistency, primarily due to false negative errors. CONCLUSIONS: We present an HFO detector that improves upon existing algorithms, and performs as well as human experts on our test data set. Validation of detector performance must be compared to more than one expert because of interrater variability. SIGNIFICANCE: This algorithm will be useful for analyzing large EEG databases to determine the pathophysiological significance of HFO events in human epileptic networks.

17270360|t|Factor analysis of the Alcohol and Drug Confrontation Scale (ADCS).
17270360|a|The Alcohol and Drug Confrontation Scale (ADCS) is a 72-item instrument that defines confrontation as an individual being told "bad things" might happen if they do not make changes to address alcohol or drug problems or maintain sobriety. Preliminary assessment of the ADCS using substance abusers entering SLH's revealed: (1) scale items were frequently endorsed; (2) confrontation was often experienced as accurate and helpful; and (3) confronters' statements were viewed supportive and accurate. This study reports the results of a factor analysis on a larger sample 179 participants using baseline and 6 month follow-up data. Results yielded a clear two factor solution: (1) Internal Support (alpha=0.80) and (2) External Intensity (alpha=0.63). The two factors accounted for 58% of the variance. The ADCS offers a fresh and broader view of confrontation that can be reliably measured.

18068307|a|This study investigated variables of perceived risk associated with one's decision to drink and drive, as well as with the occurrence and successfulness of intervention efforts by others in preventing individuals from drinking and driving. Undergraduate students were presented with scenarios manipulating number of drinks, consumption time, and distance needed to drive. Participants then provided estimates of intoxication, degree of impairment, and likelihood of getting in an accident and getting arrested for drinking and driving. In addition, participants rated three criterion variables: intention to drive, likelihood someone would try to intervene, and receptiveness to someone attempting to intervene. Data was analyzed using three random effects regression models, one for each of the criterion variables. Results indicated that perceptions of risk were associated with decisions to drive after drinking and expected likelihood of, and receptiveness to, intervention efforts, over and above one's estimate of intoxication.

15141162|t|Asymmetric distribution of the apical plasma membrane during neurogenic divisions of mammalian neuroepithelial cells.
15141162|a|At the onset of neurogenesis in the mammalian central nervous system, neuroepithelial cells switch from symmetric, proliferative to asymmetric, neurogenic divisions. In analogy to the asymmetric division of Drosophila neuroblasts, this switch of mammalian neuroepithelial cells is thought to involve a change in cleavage plane orientation from perpendicular (vertical cleavage) to parallel (horizontal cleavage) relative to the apical surface of the neuroepithelium. Here, we report, using TIS21-GFP knock-in mouse embryos to identify neurogenic neuroepithelial cells, that at the onset as well as advanced stages of neurogenesis the vast majority of neurogenic divisions, like proliferative divisions, show vertical cleavage planes. Remarkably, however, neurogenic divisions of neuroepithelial cells, but not proliferative ones, involve an asymmetric distribution to the daughter cells of the apical plasma membrane, which constitutes only a minute fraction (1-2%) of the entire neuroepithelial cell plasma membrane. Our results support a novel concept for the cell biological basis of asymmetric, neurogenic divisions of neuroepithelial cells in the mammalian central nervous system.

15029245|t|Developmentally regulated role for Ras-GRFs in coupling NMDA glutamate receptors to Ras, Erk and CREB.
15029245|a|p140 Ras-GRF1 and p130 Ras-GRF2 constitute a family of calcium/calmodulin-regulated guanine-nucleotide exchange factors that activate the Ras GTPases. Studies on mice lacking these exchange factors revealed that both p140 Ras-GRF1 and p130 Ras-GRF2 couple NMDA glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to the activation of the Ras/Erk signaling cascade and to the maintenance of CREB transcription factor activity in cortical neurons of adult mice. Consistent with this function for Ras-GRFs and the known neuroprotective effect of CREB activity, ischemia-induced CREB activation is reduced in the brains of adult Ras-GRF knockout mice and neuronal damage is enhanced. Interestingly, in cortical neurons of neonatal animals NMDARs signal through Sos rather than Ras-GRF exchange factors, implying that Ras-GRFs endow NMDARs with functions unique to mature neurons.

17592148|t|Electrical stimulation of the rostral medial prefrontal cortex in rabbits inhibits the expression of conditioned eyelid responses but not their acquisition.
17592148|a|We have studied the role of rostral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) on reflexively evoked blinks and on classically conditioned eyelid responses in alert-behaving rabbits. The rostral mPFC was identified by its afferent projections from the medial half of the thalamic mediodorsal nuclear complex. Classical conditioning consisted of a delay paradigm using a 370-ms tone as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and a 100-ms air puff directed at the left cornea as the unconditioned stimulus (US). The CS coterminated with the US. Electrical train stimulation of the contralateral rostral mPFC produced a significant inhibition of air-puff-evoked blinks. The same train stimulation of the rostral mPFC presented during the CS-US interval for 10 successive conditioning sessions significantly reduced the generation of conditioned responses (CRs) as compared with values reached by control animals. Interestingly, the percentage of CRs almost reached control values when train stimulation of the rostral mPFC was removed from the fifth conditioning session on. The electrical stimulation of the rostral mPFC in well conditioned animals produced a significant decrease in the percentage of CRs. Moreover, the stimulation of the rostral mPFC was also able to modify the kinematics (latency, amplitude, and velocity) of evoked CRs. These results suggest that the rostral mPFC is a potent inhibitor of reflexively evoked and classically conditioned eyeblinks but that activation prevents only the expression of CRs, not their latent acquisition. Functional and behavioral implications of this inhibitory role of the rostral mPFC are discussed.

16941237|t|Adults' judgments of children's coached reports.
16941237|a|This study investigated adults' judgments of the honesty of children's coached true and fabricated mock testimony. Adults saw video clips of children testifying in a mock court about a true or fabricated event in their lives. They were asked to make an assessment of the truthfulness of the testimony, and respond to questions about their perception of children's credibility. Half of the adults saw children testifying after a competence examination, and the other half saw children testifying without a competence examination. Overall, girls were rated as more competent than boys, and their testimony was more likely to be believed. Younger children were more likely to be rated as incompetent than older children. A factor analysis of adults' responses revealed six factors which significantly predicted adults' overall assessment of children's credibility, and their evaluations of children's competence to testify. Adults' detection accuracy was at chance, with the majority of children rated as truthful. Viewing the competency examination and cross-examination did not improve the adults' detection accuracy. However, seeing the cross-examination made adults' less likely to believe children's testimony. The implications of these results for the judicial system are discussed.

18528848|t|Mouse chromosome 11 harbors genetic determinants of hippocampal strain-specific nicotinic receptor expression.
18528848|a|Differences between isogenic mouse strains in cellular expression of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subunit alpha 4 (nAChR alpha 4) by the dorsal hippocampus are well known. To investigate further the genetic basis of these variations, expression of the nAChR alpha 4 subunit was measured in congenic mouse lines derived from two strains exhibiting notable divergence in the expression of this subunit: C3H and C57BL/6. Congenic lines carrying reciprocally introgressed regions (quantitative trait loci; QTL) from chromosomes 4, 5, and 12 each retained the phenotype most closely associated with the parental strain. However, in congenic lines harboring the reciprocal transfer of a chromosome 11 QTL, a characteristic difference in the ratio of interneurons versus astrocytes expressing nAChR alpha 4 in the CA1 region is reversed relative to the parental strain. These finding suggest that this chromosomal segment harbors genes that regulate strain distinct hippocampal morphology that is revealed by nAChR alpha 4 expression.

17881573|t|Identification of human-induced changes in atmospheric moisture content.
17881573|a|Data from the satellite-based Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) show that the total atmospheric moisture content over oceans has increased by 0.41 kg/m(2) per decade since 1988. Results from current climate models indicate that water vapor increases of this magnitude cannot be explained by climate noise alone. In a formal detection and attribution analysis using the pooled results from 22 different climate models, the simulated "fingerprint" pattern of anthropogenically caused changes in water vapor is identifiable with high statistical confidence in the SSM/I data. Experiments in which forcing factors are varied individually suggest that this fingerprint "match" is primarily due to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases and not to solar forcing or recovery from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of an emerging anthropogenic signal in the moisture content of earth's atmosphere.

17034579|t|T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), CD4+, CD8+, and their CD45RO+, and CD45RA+, subpopulations in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HIV-co-infected patients during treatment with interferon alpha plus ribavirin: analysis in a population on effective antiretroviral therapy.
17034579|a|Interferon (IFN)-alpha induced CD4(+) T lymphopenia is a toxic effect of the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-co-infected patients. To increase the knowledge about this secondary effect, we performed an analysis of the evolution of the T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and of their CD45RO(+) and CD45RA(+) subpopulations during the treatment of chronic hepatitis HCV with peginterferon alpha (pegIFN-alpha) + ribavirin. Twenty HCV/HIV-co-infected patients, with undetectable HIV load after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), were treated with pegIFN-alpha + ribavirin. TRECs were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and their CD45RO(+) and CD45RA(+) subpopulations were analysed by two-colour flow cytometry. Median baseline CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were 592 mm(3) and 874 mm(3), respectively. Median baseline CD45RO(+) subpopulation was 48% for CD4(+) T and 57% for CD8(+) T lymphocytes. A progressive decrease in both T cell populations, as well as of their CD45RO(+) and CD45RA(+) subpopulations, was detected, with a difference between the baseline and nadir levels approaching 50%. The evolution of T cell populations and TRECs was independent of the response to the treatment. T lymphocytes and their subpopulations returned to baseline levels at 24 weeks after the end of treatment, with the exception of the T CD4(+) CD45RA(+) subpopulation. The ratio of CD4(+) CD45RO(+)/CD4(+) CD45RA(+) increased from 0.89 (baseline) to 1.44 (24 weeks after the end of the therapy). TRECs/ml did not return to the basal values. In conclusion, a significant reduction of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and of their CD45RA(+) and CD45RO(+) subpopulations, in HIV/HCV co-infected patients treated with pegIFN-alpha was observed. Both subpopulations increased after the suppression of treatment, but the CD4(+) CD45RA subpopulation did not reach the basal levels as a consequence, at least in part, of a decrease in thymic production.

15574496|t|Accelerated telomere shortening in response to life stress.
15574496|a|Numerous studies demonstrate links between chronic stress and indices of poor health, including risk factors for cardiovascular disease and poorer immune function. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of how stress gets "under the skin" remain elusive. We investigated the hypothesis that stress impacts health by modulating the rate of cellular aging. Here we provide evidence that psychological stress--both perceived stress and chronicity of stress--is significantly associated with higher oxidative stress, lower telomerase activity, and shorter telomere length, which are known determinants of cell senescence and longevity, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy premenopausal women. Women with the highest levels of perceived stress have telomeres shorter on average by the equivalent of at least one decade of additional aging compared to low stress women. These findings have implications for understanding how, at the cellular level, stress may promote earlier onset of age-related diseases.

19365073|t|A right-sided pathway involving FGF8/Snai1 controls asymmetric development of the proepicardium in the chick embryo.
19365073|a|The proepicardium (PE) is a transient structure that forms at the venous pole of the embryonic vertebrate heart. This cardiac progenitor cell population gives rise to the epicardium, coronary vasculature, and fibroblasts. In the chicken embryo, the PE displays left-right (L-R) asymmetry and develops only on the right side, while on the left only a vestigial PE is formed, which subsequently gets lost by apoptosis. In this study, we analyzed how the L-R asymmetry pathway affects PE formation. Experimental manipulation of left-side determinants such as Shh, Nodal, and Cfc as well as forced expression of Pitx2 had no effect on the sidedness of PE development. In contrast, inhibition of early-acting regulators of L-R axis formation such as H(+)/K(+)-ATPase or primitive streak apoptosis affected the sidedness of PE development. Experimental interference with the right-side determinants Fgf8 or Snai1 prevented PE formation, whereas ectopic left-sided expression of Fgf8 or Snai1 resulted in bilateral PE development. These data provide novel insight into the molecular control of asymmetric morphogenesis suggesting that also the right side harbors an instructive signaling pathway that is involved in the control of PE development. This pathway might be of general relevance for setting up L-R asymmetries at the venous pole of the heart.

17431401|t|Cdk6 blocks myeloid differentiation by interfering with Runx1 DNA binding and Runx1-C/EBPalpha interaction.
17431401|a|Interactions between the cell cycle machinery and transcription factors play a central role in coordinating terminal differentiation and proliferation arrest. We here show that cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6) is specifically expressed in proliferating hematopoietic progenitor cells, and that Cdk6 inhibits transcriptional activation by Runx1, but not C/EBPalpha or PU.1. Cdk6 inhibits Runx1 activity by binding to the runt domain of Runx1, interfering with Runx1 DNA binding and Runx1-C/EBPalpha interaction. Cdk6 expression increased myeloid progenitor proliferation, and inhibited myeloid lineage-specific gene expression and terminal differentiation in vitro and in vivo. These effects of Cdk6 did not require Cdk6 kinase activity. Cdk6-mediated inhibition of granulocytic differentiation could be reversed by excess Runx1, consistent with Runx1 being the major target for Cdk6. We propose that Cdk6 downregulation in myeloid progenitors releases Runx1 from Cdk6 inhibition, thereby allowing terminal differentiation. Since Runx transcription factors play central roles in hematopoietic, neuronal and osteogenic lineages, this novel, noncanonical Cdk6 function may control terminal differentiation in multiple tissues and cell types.

17084599|t|Estimation of synaptic conductances.
17084599|a|In order to identify and understand mechanistically the cortical circuitry of sensory information processing estimates are needed of synaptic input fields that drive neurons. From intracellular in vivo recordings one would like to estimate net synaptic conductance time courses for excitation and inhibition, g(E)(t) and g(I)(t), during time-varying stimulus presentations. However, the intrinsic conductance transients associated with neuronal spiking can confound such estimates, and thereby jeopardize functional interpretations. Here, using a conductance-based pyramidal neuron model we illustrate errors in estimates when the influence of spike-generating conductances are not reduced or avoided. A typical estimation procedure involves approximating the current-voltage relation at each time point during repeated stimuli. The repeated presentations are done in a few sets, each with a different steady bias current. From the trial-averaged smoothed membrane potential one estimates total membrane conductance and then dissects out estimates for g(E)(t) and g(I)(t). Simulations show that estimates obtained during phases without spikes are good but those obtained from phases with spiking should be viewed with skeptism. For the simulations, we consider two different synaptic input scenarios, each corresponding to computational network models of orientation tuning in visual cortex. One input scenario mimics a push-pull arrangement for g(E)(t) and g(I)(t) and idealized as specified smooth time courses. The other is taken directly from a large-scale network simulation of stochastically spiking neurons in a slab of cortex with recurrent excitation and inhibition. For both, we show that spike-generating conductances cause serious errors in the estimates of g(E) and g(I). In some phases for the push-pull examples even the polarity of g(I) is mis-estimated, indicating significant increase when g(I) is actually decreased. Our primary message is to be cautious about forming interpretations based on estimates developed during spiking phases.

17878314|t|Targeting thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonists to the liver reduces cholesterol and triglycerides and improves the therapeutic index.
17878314|a|Despite efforts spanning four decades, the therapeutic potential of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) agonists as lipid-lowering and anti-obesity agents remains largely unexplored in humans because of dose-limiting cardiac effects and effects on the thyroid hormone axis (THA), muscle metabolism, and bone turnover. TR agonists selective for the TRbeta isoform exhibit modest cardiac sparing in rodents and primates but are unable to lower lipids without inducing TRbeta-mediated suppression of the THA. Herein, we describe a cytochrome P450-activated prodrug of a phosphonate-containing TR agonist that exhibits increased TR activation in the liver relative to extrahepatic tissues and an improved therapeutic index. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats demonstrated that the prodrug (2R,4S)-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-[(3,5-dimethyl-4-(4'-hydroxy-3'-isopropylbenzyl)phenoxy)methyl]-2-oxido-[1,3,2]-dioxaphosphonane (MB07811) undergoes first-pass hepatic extraction and that cleavage of the prodrug generates the negatively charged TR agonist (3,5-dimethyl-4-(4'-hydroxy-3'-isopropylbenzyl)phenoxy)methylphosphonic acid (MB07344), which distributes poorly into most tissues and is rapidly eliminated in the bile. Enhanced liver targeting was further demonstrated by comparing the effects of MB07811 with 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T(3)) and a non-liver-targeted TR agonist, 3,5-dichloro-4-(4-hydroxy-3-isopropylphenoxy)phenylacetic acid (KB-141) on the expression of TR agonist-responsive genes in the liver and six extrahepatic tissues. The pharmacologic effects of liver targeting were evident in the normal rat, where MB07811 exhibited increased cardiac sparing, and in the diet-induced obese mouse, where, unlike KB-141, MB07811 reduced cholesterol and both serum and hepatic triglycerides at doses devoid of effects on body weight, glycemia, and the THA. These results indicate that targeting TR agonists to the liver has the potential to lower both cholesterol and triglyceride levels with an acceptable safety profile.

15889140|t|Oncogenic transcription factor Evi1 regulates hematopoietic stem cell proliferation through GATA-2 expression.
15889140|a|The ecotropic viral integration site-1 (Evi1) is an oncogenic transcription factor in murine and human myeloid leukemia. We herein show that Evi1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in embryos and adult bone marrows, suggesting a physiological role of Evi1 in HSCs. We therefore investigate the role and authentic target genes of Evi1 in hematopoiesis using Evi1-/- mice, which die at embryonic day 10.5. HSCs in Evi1-/- embryos are markedly decreased in numbers in vivo with defective self-renewing proliferation and repopulating capacity. Notably, expression rate of GATA-2 mRNA, which is essential for proliferation of definitive HSCs, is profoundly reduced in HSCs of Evi1-/- embryos. Restoration of the Evi1 or GATA-2 expression in Evi1-/- HSCs could prevent the failure of in vitro maintenance and proliferation of HSC through upregulation of GATA-2 expression. An analysis of the GATA-2 promoter region revealed that Evi1 directly binds to GATA-2 promoter as an enhancer. Our results reveal that GATA-2 is presumably one of critical targets for Evi1 and that transcription factors regulate the HSC pool hierarchically.

18446510|t|FDA critical path initiatives: opportunities for generic drug development.
18446510|a|FDA's critical path initiative documents have focused on the challenges involved in the development of new drugs. Some of the focus areas identified apply equally to the production of generic drugs. However, there are scientific challenges unique to the development of generic drugs as well. In May 2007, FDA released a document "Critical Path Opportunities for Generic Drugs" that identified some of the specific challenges in the development of generic drugs. The key steps in generic product development are usually characterization of the reference product, design of a pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent product, design of a consistent manufacturing process and conduct of the pivotal bioequivalence study. There are several areas of opportunity where scientific progress could accelerate the development and approval of generic products and expand the range of products for which generic versions are available, while maintaining high standards for quality, safety, and efficacy. These areas include the use of quality by design to develop bioequivalent products, more efficient bioequivalence methods for systemically acting drugs (expansion of BCS waivers, highly variable drugs), and development of new bioequivalence methods for locally acting drugs.

18446511|a|There is limited information describing species related pharmacogenetic differences in animals. Despite the lack of genetic information in veterinary medicine, breed specific responses to endogenous and exogenous substances have been reported across many species. This finding underscores the importance of obtaining insight into the genotypic and phenotypic variation present across breeds. This article provides a summary of the literature pertaining to canine breed differences in physiology, drug response, drug pharmacokinetics, and metabolic idiosyncrasies. The existing knowledge of pedigrees and the known phenotypes and genotypes of dogs provides important information for determining mode of inheritance, penetration, and other major characteristics of heritable traits. Understanding these breed differences will improve canine population predictions (for canine drug products) and may be of value when extrapolating toxicology data from dogs to humans.

18446512|t|Percutaneous permeation enhancement by terpenes: mechanistic view.
18446512|a|A popular approach for improving transdermal drug delivery involves the use of penetration enhancers (sorption promoters or accelerants) which penetrate into skin to reversibly reduce the barrier resistance. The potential mechanisms of action of penetration enhancers include disruption of intercellular lipid and/or keratin domains and tight junctions. This results in enhanced drug partitioning into tissue, altered thermodynamic activity/solubility of drug etc. Synthetic chemicals (solvents, azones, pyrrolidones, surfactants etc.) generally used for this purpose are rapidly losing their value in transdermal patches due to reports of their absorption into the systemic circulation and subsequent possible toxic effect upon long term application. Terpenes are included in the list of Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) substances and have low irritancy potential. Their mechanism of percutaneous permeation enhancement involves increasing the solubility of drugs in skin lipids, disruption of lipid/protein organization and/or extraction of skin micro constituents that are responsible for maintenance of barrier status. Hence, they appear to offer great promise for use in transdermal formulations. This article is aimed at reviewing the mechanisms responsible for percutaneous permeation enhancement activity of terpenes, which shall foster their rational use in transdermal formulations.

18446514|t|Evaluation of methods for estimating time to steady state with examples from phase 1 studies.
18446514|a|An overview is provided of the methodologies used in determining the time to steady state for Phase 1 multiple dose studies. These methods include NOSTASOT (no-statistical-significance-of-trend), Helmert contrasts, spline (quadratic) regression, effective half life for accumulation, nonlinear mixed effects modeling, and Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. For each methodology we describe its advantages and disadvantages. The first two methods do not require any distributional assumptions for the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and are limited to average assessment of steady state. Also spline regression which provides both average and individual assessment of time to steady state does not require any distributional assumptions for the PK parameters. On the other hand, nonlinear mixed effects modeling and Bayesian hierarchical modeling which allow for the estimation of both population and subject-specific estimates of time to steady state do require distributional assumptions on PK parameters. The current investigation presents eight case studies for which the time to steady state was assessed using the above mentioned methodologies. The time to steady state estimates obtained from nonlinear mixed effects modeling, Bayesian hierarchal approach, effective half life, and spline regression were generally similar.

18446518|t|Role of biotransformation studies in minimizing metabolism-related liabilities in drug discovery.
18446518|a|Metabolism-related liabilities continue to be a major cause of attrition for drug candidates in clinical development. Such problems may arise from the bioactivation of the parent compound to a reactive metabolite capable of modifying biological materials covalently or engaging in redox-cycling reactions leading to the formation of other toxicants. Alternatively, they may result from the formation of a major metabolite with systemic exposure and adverse pharmacological activity. To avert such problems, biotransformation studies are becoming increasingly important in guiding the refinement of a lead series during drug discovery and in characterizing lead candidates prior to clinical evaluation. This article provides an overview of the methods that are used to uncover metabolism-related liabilities in a pre-clinical setting and offers suggestions for reducing such liabilities via the modification of structural features that are used commonly in drug-like molecules.
