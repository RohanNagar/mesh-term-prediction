9339686|t|Higher neonatal cerebral blood flow correlates with worse childhood neurologic outcome.
9339686|a|Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in newborn infants is often below levels necessary to sustain brain viability in adults. Controversy exists regarding the effects of such low CBF on subsequent neurologic function. We determined the current childhood neurologic status and IQ in 26 subjects who had measurements of CBF performed with PET in the neonatal period between 1983 and 1989 as part of a study of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Follow-up information at ages 4 to 12 years was obtained on all 26 subjects. Ten subjects had died. All 16 survivors underwent clinical neurologic evaluation, and 14 also underwent intelligence testing. Eight had abnormal clinical neurologic evaluations; eight were normal. The mean neonatal CBF in those with abnormal childhood neurologic outcome was significantly higher than in those with normal childhood neurologic outcome (35.64 +/- 11.80 versus 18.26 +/- 8.62 mL 100 g(-1) min(-1), t = 3.36, p = 0.005). A significant negative correlation between neonatal CBF and childhood IQ was demonstrated (Spearman rank correlation r = -0.675, p = 0.008). Higher CBF was associated with lower IQ. The higher CBF in subjects with worse neurologic and intellectual outcome may reflect greater loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation or other vascular regulatory mechanisms due to more severe brain damage.

9357896|t|Bupivacaine inhibition of L-type calcium current in ventricular cardiomyocytes of hamster.
9357896|a|BACKGROUND: The local anesthetic bupivacaine is cardiotoxic when accidentally injected into the circulation. Such cardiotoxicity might involve an inhibition of cardiac L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L). This study was designed to define the mechanism of bupivacaine inhibition of ICa,L. METHODS: Cardiomyocytes were enzymatically dispersed from hamster ventricles. Certain voltage- and time-dependencies of ICa,L were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp method in the presence and absence of different concentrations of bupivacaine. RESULTS: Bupivacaine, in a concentration-dependent manner (10-300 microM), tonically inhibited the peak amplitude of ICa,L. The inhibition was characterized by an increase in the time of recovery from inactivation and a negative-voltage shift of the steady-state inactivation curve. The inhibition was shown to be voltage-dependent, and the peak amplitude of ICa,L could not be restored to control levels by a wash from bupivacaine. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of ICa,L appears, in part, to result from bupivacaine predisposing L-type Ca channels to the inactivated state. Data from washout suggest that there may be two mechanisms of inhibition at work. Bupivacaine may bind with low affinity to the Ca channel and also affect an unidentified metabolic component that modulates Ca channel function.

9298188|t|Formation of formate and hydrogen, and flux of reducing equivalents and carbon in Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1.
9298188|a|A pathway for conversion of the metabolic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and the formation of acetate, succinate, formate, and H2 in the anaerobic cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 was constructed on the basis of enzyme activities detected in extracts of cells grown in cellulose- or cellobiose-limited continuous culture. PEP was converted to acetate and CO2 (via pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and acetate kinase) or carboxylated to form succinate (via PEP carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and fumarate reductase). Lactate was not formed even during rapid growth (batch culture, mu = 0.35/h). H2 was formed by a hydrogenase rather than by cleavage of formate, and 13C-NMR and 14C-exchange reaction data indicated that formate was produced by CO2 reduction, not by a cleavage of pyruvate. The distribution of PEP into the acetate and succinate pathways was not affected by changing extracellular pH and growth rates within the normal growth range. However, increasing growth rate from 0.017/h to 0.244/h resulted in a shift toward formate production, presumably at the expense of H2. This shift suggested that reducing equivalents could be balanced through formate or H2 production without affecting the yields of the major carbon-containing fermentation endproducts.

9263049|t|Approximate confidence intervals for heritability from method R estimates.
9263049|a|Method R estimates of heritability (h2) and associated confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from simulated data using a single trait, direct effects, full animal model, with 50% subsampling. Five hundred data sets were simulated for each of five levels of h2 (.10, .20, .30, .40, and .50) and two types of pedigree structure (random pedigree structure [N = 2,000] that varied over simulations, or the pedigree structure from a real data set [N = 2,644] that was constant for all simulations). The first 10, 20, and all 50 h2 estimates were used to obtain 80, 90, 95, and 99% CI for each data set. The variance of h2 estimates within data sets approximated the sampling variance of the h2 estimates. The Box-Cox transformation was used to normalize the distribution of estimates from each data set. Confidence intervals were computed on the transformed scale as CI = mu +/- (T x sigma), where mu and sigma = the mean and SD of the N transformed h2 estimates, respectively, and T = the critical value from the T distribution for a 1-alpha CI, with df = N-1. Upper and lower CI bounds were converted back to the original scale by reversing the transformation. The percentages of CI containing the true h2 value, pooled across all levels of h2, types of pedigree, and number of estimates used to obtain CI, for 80, 90, 95, and 99% CI were 81.14, 90.96, 95.27, and 98.76%, respectively. These results suggested that Method R h2 estimates can be used to obtain reliable CI.

9308130|t|rhDNase as an example of recurrent event analysis.
9308130|a|We consider counting process methods for analysing time-to-event data with multiple or recurrent outcomes, using the models developed by Anderson and Gill, Wei, Lin and Weissfeld and Prentice, Williams and Peterson. We compare the methods, and show how to implement them using popular statistical software programs. By analysing three data sets, we illustrate the strengths and pitfalls of each method. The first example is simulated and involves the effect of a hidden covariate. The second is based on a trial of gamma interferon, and behaves remarkably like the first. The third and most interesting example involves both multiple events and discontinuous intervals at risk, and the three approaches give dissimilar answers. We recommend the AG and marginal models for the analysis of this type of data.

9317033|t|Involvement of p21racA, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and vacuolar ATPase in phagocytosis of bacteria and erythrocytes by Entamoeba histolytica: suggestive evidence for coincidental evolution of amebic invasiveness.
9317033|a|Trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan parasite that causes amebic dysentery, phagocytose bacteria in the colonic lumen and erythrocytes (RBC) in host tissues. Because tissue invasion is an evolutionary dead end, it is likely that amebic pathogenicity is coincidentally selected, i.e., the same methods used to kill bacteria in the colonic lumen are used by parasites to damage host cells and cause disease. In support of this idea, the amebic lectin and pore-forming peptide are involved in binding and killing, respectively, bacteria and host epithelial cells. Here amebic phagocytosis of bacteria, RBC, and mucin-coated beads was disrupted by overexpression of E. histolytica p21(racA-V12), a ras-family protein involved in selection of sites of actin polymerization, which had been mutated to eliminate its GTPase activity. p21(racA-V12) transformants were also defective in capping and cytokinesis, while pinocytosis of fluorescent dextrans was not affected. Wortmannin, a fungal inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria, RBC, and mucin-coated beads by wild-type amebae. In contrast to p21(racA-V12) overexpression, wortmannin abolished amebic pinocytosis of dextrans but had no inhibitory effects on capping. Inhibition of amebic vacuolar acidification by bafilomycin also decreased bacterial and RBC uptake. These results, which demonstrate similarities between mechanisms of phagocytosis of bacteria and RBC by amebae and macrophages, support the idea of coincidental selection of amebic genes encoding proteins that mediate destruction of host cells.

9382160|t|Determinants of type of initial hemodialysis vascular access.
9382160|a|Vascular access thrombosis is more common with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts than with native arteriovenous fistulae (AVF). Recent studies report an unexplained excess vascular access morbidity in women on hemodialysis. We studied 92 consecutive end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving their first permanent hemodialysis vascular access at initiation of hemodialysis to identify variables that determine assignment of either a PTFE graft or a native AVF. Independent variables included: age, gender, race, etiology of ESRD, and whether or not access surgery was electively planned before need for dialytic therapy. The 51 women and 41 men included 65 blacks, 13 Hispanics, 11 whites, and 3 Orientals aged 50 +/- (SD) 16 years. Of the 92 subjects, 54 (59%) received an AVF, while 38 (41%) received a PTFE graft. 36 (94%) of 38 PTFE grafts were placed in the upper arm as compared with 9 (17%) of 54 AVF (p = 0.0001). Also, 45 (83%) of 54 AVF were placed in the forearm as compared with only 2 (6%) of 38 PTFE grafts (p = 0.0001). Women were more likely to receive a PTFE graft - 28 (55%) of 51 - than men - 10 (24%) of 41 (p = 0.003). By contrast, men were more likely to get an AVF - 31 (76%) of 41 - than women - 23 (45 %) of 51 (p = 0.003). The log linear analysis confirmed that this finding was significant (p = 0.0018) for the coefficient of interaction between gender and type of vascular access. No other independent variable had a significant relationship with type of vascular access. We conclude that women with ESRD are more likely to receive a PTFE graft for hemodialysis, while men are more likely to get an AVF. These findings may explain, in part, the reported excess vascular access morbidity in women on hemodialysis.

9378488|t|TCR alpha beta+ CD4- CD8- T cells differentiate extrathymically in an lck-independent manner and participate in early response against Listeria monocytogenes infection through interferon-gamma production.
9378488|a|T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta+ CD4- CD8- (double-negative; DN) T cells appear in the peritoneal cavity at an early stage of intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. In the present report, we analysed the developmental pathway and functions of the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells using the L. monocytogenes infection system. The TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells appeared in the peritoneal cavity after L. monocytogenes i.p. infection in adult-thymectomized lethally irradiated bone marrow chimeras and p56lck-deficient mice. The results demonstrated that the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells can develop extrathymically in a p56lck-independent manner. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells expressed genes for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the macrophage chemotactic factors MCP-1 and Eta-1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but lacked expression of genes for interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4 and IL-10. As expected from the RT-PCR analysis, the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells produced IFN-gamma in response to anti-TCR beta monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-CD3 mAb and L. monocytogenes-infected macrophages but IL-4 was undetectable after the stimulation. Furthermore, the intracellular cytokine staining analysis demonstrated that approximately half of the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells detectable at the early stage of L. monocytogenes infection were IFN-gamma-producing cells. All of the results suggest that the TCR alpha beta+ DN T cells develop through a unique extrathymic p56lck-independent pathway and participate in early protection against bacterial infection through activation and accumulation of macrophages.

9298438|a|The percentage contribution of each item on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to the total BDI score was compared across patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and normal college students. We considered an item to be confounded by MS-related symptoms if its percentage contribution to the total BDI score was significantly greater in the MS group than the major depression and control groups. Items measuring work difficulty, fatigue, and concerns about health met this criterion. These items accounted for 34, 17, and 19% of the total BDI score in the MS, major depression, and control groups, respectively. Using the 18-item BDI (BDI-18) which resulted from excluding the 3 confounded items, MS patients found to be were more depressed than controls but less depressed than the major depression group. The identification of signs of depression not confounded with MS which could be substituted for confounded signs was also discussed.

9279722|a|Sera from 30 subjects vaccinated with the Pasteur Merieux Serums & Vaccins (PM) inactivated hepatitis A vaccine, and from 30 subjects vaccinated with the Smithkline Beecham (SB) inactivated hepatitis A vaccine, were tested in two laboratories in order to provide comparative data on neutralizing activities of vaccine-induced antibodies. Sera were also evaluated by a modified radioimmunoassay (mRIA) and results were compared to neutralization assays results. Neutralizing antibody titres provided by the two laboratories correlated well (coefficient or correlation 0.42, P < 0.001). Neutralizing antibodies were detected after vaccination with both vaccines, and the kinetics of neutralizing antibody were the same with both vaccines. The titres gradually increased between the second week after the first dose and the post-booster dose (week 28). A strong booster effect of the booster vaccine dose on neutralizing titres was observed. Significantly higher neutralizing antibody titres with the PM vaccine were observed as early immune response on week 2 titres on both series of results. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titres and vaccine-induced antibody mRIA titres correlated well (coefficient of correlation 0.82 and 0.72, respectively, P < 0.0001 in both cases). These results demonstrate early appearance of neutralizing antibody at high titre with the PM vaccine.

The radiographic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) features are highlighted. Although the occurrence of metastatic disease in hepatocellular carcinoma is exceedingly rare, it may be increasingly encountered as survival of patients is improved with advancing methods of therapy, both surgical and palliative. It often accompanies local recurrence, and invariably signals a grave prognosis with extremely short life expectancy. Unusually, two of the five patients in this series presented initially with skeletal metastases which led to the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

9293364|t|Transected thoracic aorta: age-specific differences in incidence and possible reasons.
9293364|a|The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of aortic transaction in relation to age, and to examine possible reasons for the observed differences. Data from the North Carolina Medical Database over a 7-year period were examined for the total number of motor vehicle accident victims and for the subset with aortic rupture, based on age at presentation. Data were then divided into 10-year intervals and the differences analyzed using chi-square analysis. Differences among various age groups were statistically significant (P = 0.0001). The highest rate was in the 21-30-year-old age group and average incidence for all ages was 0.7%. High incidence of aortic transaction in the 21-30-year-old group may be due to an increase in high-risk behaviors in such persons, to an improved survival compared with other age ranges, or to an inherent susceptibility of the aorta at this stage of life. These data have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of aortic transaction and should be taken into account when developing practice guidelines for its management.

9377289|t|[Clinical variability of bilateral paramedian thalamic infarcts]
9377289|a|INTRODUCTION: Thalamic infarcts in paramedian artery territory are seen fairly frequently owing to certain peculiarities of the vascularization of the thalamus. However, clinical diagnosis is usually difficult because of the many varieties and peculiarities of the symptomatology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a review of twelve cases of bilateral paramedian infarcts of the thalamus seen in our Department of Neurology and in a private surgery. We analyze the symptoms and their relationship to the neuro-radiological findings. Finally we compare our observations with the descriptions published by other authors and seek and anatomo-functional relationship for each of the symptoms and signs observed. RESULTS: The usual clinical outline in our patients included disorders of consciousness, different types of oculomotor disorders and cerebellar symptoms, mainly of gait. Other less common findings were memory disorders and abnormal movements. In no case were there sensory changes and pyramidal signs were rare in the absence of significant extra-thalamic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, although generally comparable to those described in the literature consulted, were somewhat different with regard to cerebellar symptoms and the absence of sensory and pyramidal signs. We also emphasize the marked differences seen between the individual patients in our series. A good knowledge of the possible clinical variants of these lesions is necessary for a correct initial diagnostic approach in the study of these patients.

The factors associated with increased use of medical services included proximity to a VA outpatient clinic, receipt of VA compensation payments, discharge from a facility with greater resources devoted to medical-surgical care, and prompt outpatient mental health follow-up. Better integration of medical and psychiatric services may help improve access to medical care for the severely mentally ill.

9293538|t|Ameloblastic fibrosarcoma arising de novo in the maxilla.
9293538|a|An ameloblastic fibrosarcoma (AFS) arising in the maxilla of a 14-year-old male is described. The tumor originated from the alveolar bone of the right maxilla with no apparent history of pre-existing lesion. Histologically, the lesion was composed of benign-appearing epithelial islands and strands scattered within an exceedingly cellular mass of mesenchymal tissue comprising a large number of stellate-and spindle-shaped fibroblast-like cells with marked pleomorphism. Occasional cementum-like calcification was also noted. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic mesenchymal cells were positive only for vimentin, whereas the ameloblast-like epithelial component showed a distinctly positive reaction for wide-spectrum keratin and squamous cytokeratin. Clinicopathological features of the current case, as well as previously reported examples of AFS originating from the maxilla, are briefly discussed.

9346183|t|Solitary fibrous tumor of soft tissue: a report of 15 cases, including 5 malignant examples with light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural data.
9346183|a|We describe 15 soft tissue solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) occurring in patients 24 to 78 years old (average, 50.6 yr). Ten tumors were benign and arose in the head and neck area (three tumors), thigh (two), vulva (two), upper arm (one), lower leg (one), and retroperitoneum (one). Five tumors were histologically malignant and arose in the thigh (two), abdominal wall (one), buttock (one), and retroperitoneum (one). All of the tumors were grossly well circumscribed. The benign tumors measured from 2 to 10 cm (average, 4.8 cm) and the malignant ones from 3 to 5.5 cm (average, 4.3 cm) in greatest diameter. Microscopically, the benign tumors showed areas of hypercellularity with variable amounts of collagenous and myxoid stroma; one had amianthoid fibers. The malignant tumors were composed of cytologically atypical cells enmeshed in a collagenous or myxoid extracellular matrix. Ultrastructural study of three benign and three malignant tumors showed fibroblastic differentiation; one benign tumor showed myofibroblastic differentiation. Immunohistochemically, all of the tumors examined were immunoreactive for vimentin, and seven of nine were positive for CD34, including all of the malignant ones. There was focal staining for muscle actin in two benign tumors and for Leu-7 in one benign tumor; there was no staining for cytokeratin, desmin, S-100 protein, epithelial membrane antigen, or smooth muscle actin in any of the examined tissues. Follow-up was available for eight patients for 6 to 21 months (average, 12 mo). No tumor recurred locally or metastasized. The SFTs reported herein support the experiences of others who recently described these tumors in the somatic soft tissues. In addition, our series highlights the occurrence of malignant SFTs in the soft tissues. SFTs should be separated from other spindle cell sarcomas, with which they can be confused.

9325071|t|Plasma effects on phagocytic activity and hydrogen peroxide production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes in neonates.
9325071|a|To elucidate the defense mechanism in neonates against bacterial infections, phagocytic activity and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in the whole blood and the effects of plasma on these functions were investigated on 44 healthy mature neonates (term 37 to 41 weeks) and 15 premature neonates (term 30 to 36 weeks) using two color flow cytometric analysis. The results were compared to those of a healthy adult control group (n = 10). PMN phagocytic activity was low in both mature and premature neonates. H2O2 production of PMN with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation and following phagocytosis was augmented in both mature and premature neonates. When plasma and PMNs of adults and neonates were separated and combined differently, phagocytic activity and H2O2 production of PMNs appeared to be principally regulated by the plasma employed. This finding indicates that plasma has major effects on both phagocytosis and H2O2 production by PMNs of newborn neonates.

9379259|t|Forearm muscle oxygenation decreases with low levels of voluntary contraction.
9379259|a|The purpose of our investigation was to determine if the near infrared spectroscopy technique was sensitive to changes in tissue oxygenation at low levels of isometric contraction in the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. Nine subjects were seated with the right arm abducted to 45 degrees, elbow flexed to 85 degrees, forearm pronated 45 degrees, and wrist and forearm supported on an armrest throughout the protocol. Altered tissue oxygenation was measured noninvasively with near infrared spectroscopy. The near infrared spectroscopy probe was placed over the extensor carpi radialis brevis of the subject's right forearm and secured with an elastic wrap. After 1 minute of baseline measurements taken with the muscle relaxed, four different loads were applied just proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joint such that the subjects isometrically contracted the extensor carpi radialis brevis at 5, 10, 15, and 50% of the maximum voluntary contraction for 1 minute each. A 3-minute recovery period followed each level of contraction. At the end of the protocol, with the probe still in place, a value for ischemic tissue oxygenation was obtained for each subject. This value was considered the physiological zero and hence 0% tissue oxygenation. Mean tissue oxygenation (+/-SE) decreased from resting baseline (100% tissue oxygenation) to 89 +/- 4, 81 +/- 8, 78 +/- 8, and 47 +/- 8% at 5, 10, 15, and 50% of the maximum voluntary contraction, respectively. Tissue oxygenation levels at 10, 15, and 50% of the maximum voluntary contraction were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than the baseline value. Our results indicate that tissue oxygenation significantly decreases during brief, low levels of static muscle contraction and that near infrared spectroscopy is a sensitive technique for detecting deoxygenation noninvasively at low levels of forearm muscle contraction. Our findings have important implications in occupational medicine because oxygen depletion induced by low levels of muscle contraction may be directly linked to muscle fatigue.

9085387|t|Educational and informational strategies to reduce pesticide risks. Council on Scientific Affairs.
9085387|a|BACKGROUND: In 1993, the American Medical Association (AMA) requested its Council on Scientific Affairs to investigate issues and concerns related to (1) improving public notification of pesticide applications and (2) improving educational programs for commercial and farm pesticide applicators and increasing enforcement of licensing examination requirements. This report was presented at the 1994 Interim Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates as Report 4 of the Council on Scientific Affairs. METHODS: Information for the report was derived from published literature and from personal communications with state and federal regulatory officials, physicians, and representatives of pest control, lawn care, and farm organizations. Some information about state certification and training programs was obtained from telephone conversations with pesticide applicator training program coordinators from California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. These states were selected because they contain large agricultural or urban populations that are likely to require the services of trained professional pesticide applicators. RESULTS: Current surveillance systems are inadequate to characterize potential exposure problems related either to pesticide usage or to pesticide related illnesses. The effectiveness of applicator certification and training programs and public notification programs could not be determined because of a lack of federal and state survey data for making useful assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Considering current data gaps, it is prudent for homeowners, farmers, and workers to limit pesticide exposures to themselves and others.

9327223|t|HIV-associated lymphomas.
9327223|a|Intermediate and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) with a B-cell phenotype are AIDS-defining illnesses. The incidence of systemic NHL increased greatly and primary central nervous system NHL increased even more in the HIV-infected population. Further increases in frequency are anticipated as HIV-infected individuals survive longer in an immunosuppressed state with improved antiretroviral treatment and treatment of opportunistic infections. Unusual types of NHL and manifestations of Hodgkin's disease are seen in HIV-infected individuals also. The pathologic and clinical features of the HIV-associated lymphomas and treatment approaches and results are the subjects of this review. Other articles in this issue discuss epidemiology and pathogenesis.

9339895|t|Hinnavin I, an antibacterial peptide from cabbage butterfly, Artogeia rapae.
9339895|a|We have previously isolated four antibacterial peptides from the immune haemolymph of the fifth instar larvae of cabbage butterfly, Artogeia rapae [Yoe, S. M., Bang, I. S., Kang, C. S., and Kim, H. J. (1996) Mol. Cells 6, 609-614]. They were induced by live, nonpathogenic gram negative bacteria. One of these novel antibacterial peptides was named hinnavin I. Hinnavin I is heat stable; its activity was retained after 60 min incubation at 100 degrees C, being effective against gram negative and/or gram positive bacteria. Hinnavin I and lysozyme II showed a powerful synergistic effect on the inhibition of bacterial growth. Amino acid composition was analyzed and the molecular weight was determined to be 4,139.94+/-10.91 Da by the ESI mass spectrometer. To elucidate the primary structure of hinnavin I, the amino acid sequence of this peptide was determined by N-terminal sequencing techniques. The amino-terminal half of the molecule was rich in charged amino acids and was hydrophilic, whereas the carboxyl-terminal half was hydrophobic.

9307842|t|DNA adducts and the mechanism of carcinogenesis and cytotoxicity of methylating agents of environmental and clinical significance.
9307842|a|DNA adducts are covalent complexes formed between genotoxic carcinogens and DNA bases, and constitute a critical early intermediate on the pathway of chemical carcinogenesis. Their accumulation in different tissues reflects the amount of activated carcinogen reaching DNA, and can therefore serve as an index of the biologically relevant dose reaching the target tissues or cells. Methylating agents are of interest in view of their occurrence in the environment and their use as cytotoxic drugs in cancer chemotherapy. Current evidence indicates that O6-methylguanine plays a particularly important role in the mutagenic, carcinogenic, and cytotoxic activities of methylating agents. O6-Methylguanine is repaired efficiently by the enzyme O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT). Lack of this enzyme results in excessive accumulation of O6-methylguanine and recent evidence suggests that significant quantitative effects on adduct accumulation may be linked to conditions of very low AGT levels. This would be important from the point of view of clinical practice, since modulation of AGT is under investigation as a means of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of clinical agents acting via the production of O6-methylguanine and related adducts, such as, for example, procarbazine, dacarbazine, and some nitrosoureas. The measurement of O6-methylguanine in human DNA has been employed as a tool to investigate the role of environmental methylating agents in human carcinogenesis. While the nature and origin of the methylating agents responsible for these adducts is currently unknown, recent studies in patas monkeys have shown that N-nitrosodimethylamine, a methylating carcinogen to which human exposure is well documented, is capable of efficiently generating O6-methylguanine in most tissues, including fetal tissues. Furthermore, it has been found that this damage is substantially enhanced by the coadministration of ethyl alcohol which acts by inhibiting the liver first-pass metabolism of the carcinogen, an observation which supports the hypothesis that alcohol consumption may act as a risk factor in human carcinogenesis by augmenting the action of nitrosamines.

9385099|t|Product-limit survival functions with correlated survival times.
9385099|a|A simple variance estimator for product-limit survival functions is demonstrated for survival times with nested errors. Such data arise whenever survival times are observed within clusters of related observations. Greenwood's formula, which assumes independent observations, is not appropriate in this situation. A robust variance estimator is developed using Taylor series linearized values and the between-cluster variance estimator commonly used in multi-stage sample surveys. A simulation study shows that the between-cluster variance estimator is approximately unbiased and yields confidence intervals that maintain the nominal level for several patterns of correlated survival times. The simulation study also shows that Greenwood's formula underestimates the variance when the survival times are positively correlated within a cluster and yields confidence intervals that are too narrow. Extension to life table methods is also discussed.

9350074|a|We amplified and sequenced the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain VDJ genomic unit in B-leukemias and used it as a clone-specific marker for the molecular monitoring of the patients during and after therapeutic treatment. The method described is patient-specific rather than disorder-specific, more sensitive and less time-consuming than other conventional techniques for the detection of minimal residual disease. We propose reproducible and quick procedures, from DNA extraction to Southern blotting, that can be easily performed in any clinical laboratory and also applied to other kinds of investigation.

9342465|t|Amniotic fluid index variations after amniocentesis, amnioinfusion and amnioreduction: preliminary data.
9342465|a|We studied the relationship between the ultrasonographically measurable variations in the amniotic fluid index (AFI) and actual changes in the amniotic fluid volume induced by three differing invasive procedures: genetic amniocentesis, amnioinfusion and amnioreduction. We examined 50 patients, all between the 15th and 34th weeks of pregnancy, subdivided into three groups. The first group consisted of 33 women who underwent genetic amniocentesis, the second was of 11 patients submitted to amnioinfusion for oligohydramnios (AFI < 5 cm), and the third was composed of 6 patients affected by hydramnios (AFI > 20 cm) and treated with amnioreduction. In all cases AFI was measured before and after the invasive procedures and their variations (delta AFI) were correlated to the actual quantities of liquid infused or extracted. All the procedures gave rise to statistically significant AFI changes. After genetic amniocentesis, the mean change was from 12.0 to 10.9 cm (p < 0.005), after amnioinfusion from 3.1 to 10.6 cm (p < 0.0001) and after amnioreduction from 33.1 to 22.0 cm. (p < 0.005). However, a significant linear correlation between delta AFI and the fluid volume variations actually induced was found for amnioinfusion (y = 0.236537 + 0.031465x; R2 = 44.4%; p < 0.05) and for amnioreduction (y = -0.0584294 + 0.012008x; R2 = 89.8%. p < 0.00001). Only for amnioreduction is it possible, as proved by a multiple regression analysis, to improve the predictability of delta AFI, taking into consideration together with the quantity of fluid aspirated, the value of the preprocedure AFI (R2 = 92%; p < 0.05).

9304708|t|Applications of gene transfer in hematologic malignancy.
9304708|a|Although gene transfer was originally conceived as a means to replace or correct defective genes in patients with inherited disorders, the process has shown broad potential for intervention in hematologic malignancy and for study of hematopoietic stem cell biology. Gene transfer strategies now under investigation for these applications include 1) repair of one or more genetic defects associated with the malignant process, 2) delivery of a prodrug-metabolizing enzyme that causes tumor cells to become sensitive to the corresponding anticancer drug, 3) modification of immune responses to the cancer, and 4) introduction of drug resistance genes to increase the therapeutic index of cytotoxic agents. Finally, by marking normal or malignant cells with readily detectable genes, one can monitor the efficacy of therapy or study the dynamics of stem cell behavior in vivo. At present these applications are limited by the quality of vectors, but as transduction efficiencies and gene regulatory mechanisms improve, gene transfer can be expected to evolve into a major therapeutic modality in its own right.

9365353|t|Concentric and eccentric isokinetic assessment of flexor-extensor torque ratios at the hip, knee, and ankle in a sample population of healthy subjects.
9365353|a|OBJECTIVE: To establish the relationship between the flexor/extensor torque ratios in the hip, knee, and ankle. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Laboratory of a university rehabilitation department. PARTICIPANTS: From a group of 158 healthy volunteers, 138 subjects completed all the tests in concentric mode, and 65 in eccentric mode. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The flexor/extensor torque ratios of the hip, knee, and ankle were analyzed by means of isokinetic concentric and eccentric tests. Analysis of variance was carried out to compare the mean values of the ratios obtained between the male and female populations and between the right and left sides, and correlation analysis between the values of the joints. RESULTS: The flexor/extensor torque ratios differed significantly according to sex and angular velocities, but not according to side except for the ankle. No significant relationship was found between the flexor/extensor torque ratios in the hip, knee, and ankle joints. CONCLUSIONS: The flexor-extensor torque ratio of the knee and hip can be used as a reference point during rehabilitation of the contralateral side. Our results demonstrating the absence of correlation between the flexor/extensor torque ratio in each joint of the same limb, however, call for further longitudinal studies to be made under specific circumstances, such as training or immobilization of one joint, to follow the course of agonist/antagonist ratios and the synergistic activity between the joints.

9327207|t|The rise and fall of atrial natriuretic peptide for acute renal failure.
9327207|a|Atrial natriuretic peptide can increase glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction and can promote natriuresis, effects that would logically seem to improve renal function after acute tubular necrosis from ischemic or toxic injury. Early human trials suggested a beneficial effect of atrial natriuretic peptide on creatinine clearance, and a reduction in the need for dialysis in treated patients. However, randomized, placebo-controlled trials have failed to show a clinically relevant benefit on survival, dialysis-free survival, or renal function in patients treated with this agent.

9324068|t|Transplacental transfer of naltrexone in rats.
9324068|a|Extracts of fetal (20 days gestation) brain, heart, and liver were evaluated for naltrexone in rats 1 hour following maternal injection of 50 mg/kg opioid antagonist; adult plasma from the pregnant rats was analyzed. Samples were prepared by ultrafiltration, lyophilized, reconstituted in mobile phase, and separated by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. This qualitative analysis revealed the presence of naltrexone in all fetal tissues, as well as in adult plasma. These results indicate naltrexone, maternally administered, passes through the placenta and enters the fetus. The data would suggest that reports concerning somatic and neurobiological acceleration in offspring exposed to naltrexone during gestation may be the result of a direct opioid antagonist action in the fetus.

9322764|t|Prevalence and chromosomal map location of Staphylococcus aureus adhesin genes.
9322764|a|Using genomic DNA from 25 unrelated strains and probes specific for each gene, we assessed the prevalence of the Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) adhesion genes cna, fnbA, fnbB, fib, clfA, fbpA, ebpS and map. All 25 strains encoded fib, clfA, ebpS, map and at least one of the fnb genes. fbpA and coa appeared to be allelic variants of the same gene with the fbpA variant being present in only four of 25 isolates. cna was present in 10 of 25 strains. Using Southern blot analysis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA resolved by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the adhesion genes were mapped to SmaI fragments A (ebpS), B (fib and clfA), C (fnbA/fnbB), E (fbpA), F (map) and G (cna). Despite variations in SmaI restriction profiles, co-localization of adhesin genes with genes known to map to specific SmaI fragments in the Sa 8325-4 chromosome strains suggests that the chromosomal location of each adhesin gene is conserved.

9237552|t|Iron deposits in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease brains.
9237552|a|Iron may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases by promoting oxidative damage. The localization of iron in multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains was investigated to further the understanding of its pathogenic role in these disease states. Earlier studies, utilizing a standard Perls' stain, yielded conflicting reports regarding the distribution of iron deposits in MS brains, and a previous study on AD brains utilized a diaminobenzidine (DAB) enhanced version of this stain. In the present study, a modified version of the DAB-enhanced stain was used; it utilizes sodium borohydride, proteinase K, Triton X-100 and xylenes to increase the accessibility of tissue iron to histochemical reagents. This modified method can reveal iron deposits that are missed by the Perls' or DAB-enhanced Perls' stains. In addition to its normal deposition in oligodendrocytes and myelin, iron was detected in reactive microglia, ameboid microglia and macrophages in MS brains. In AD brains, three types of plaques were stained: dense core, clear core and amorphous plaques. Punctate staining was also observed in neurons in the corticies of AD brains. The structure accounting for punctate labeling may be damaged mitochondria, lipofuscin or amyloid deposits. Dense core plaques, clear plaques and punctate labeling were not detected in the previous AD study which utilized only the DAB-enhanced Perls' stain. The labeling of these additional structures illustrates the benefit of the modified method. In summary, the localization of iron deposition in MS and AD brains indicates potential sites where iron could promote oxidative damage in these disease states.

9344613|t|Prostaglandin H synthase expression is variable in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines.
9344613|a|The expression of prostaglandin H synthases can be induced by many stimuli and is likely to be important in control of the cell cycle. The analysis of prostaglandin H synthase-1 and -2 expression in colon adenocarcinoma cell lines is a useful model system for studying the function of the prostaglandin H synthases, especially with regard to proliferation and adhesion. Prostaglandin H synthase-1 protein is not found in any of eight human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. Expression of prostaglandin H synthase-2 is variable for the eight cell lines: three constitutively expressed active protein, four did not express this gene at all, and one had mRNA but no active protein. Thus, five colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines exhibit "null" expression of prostaglandin synthase-2. The three cell lines with constitutive expression of prostaglandin H synthase-2 produce PGE2. Prostaglandin E2 production could be inhibited by aspirin and NS398 without inhibiting proliferation, while direct addition of prostaglandin E2 inhibits proliferation. Adhesion to collagen IV and fibronectin was stronger in those cell lines that expressed prostaglandin H synthase-2. The constitutive expression of prostaglandin H synthase-2 is associated with increased adhesion to extracellular matrix components and a potential inhibition of proliferation through the production of prostaglandin E2. The absence of PGH synthase-2 expression in some cell lines may result from the original tumor's need to inactivate these associated functions. Our evidence suggests that PGH synthase-2 is a possible candidate for a tumor suppressor gene at 1q23-qter.

9345238|t|A paper for debate: vein versus PTFE for critical limb ischaemia--an unfair comparison?
9345238|a|INTRODUCTION: There is a widely held view that vein grafts for infrainguinal arterial reconstruction perform much better than prosthetic conduits, the best of which seems to be PTFE. Many randomised studies have been conducted which confirm this opinion, but is the difference as large as it is thought to be? One interesting feature of published trials is that the results for obligatory PTFE (when no vein is available) were much worse than the results for randomised PTFE grafts. The only way to explain this is that these groups of patients were not similar, and there are probably other factors which contribute to the difference in results when vein and PTFE grafts are compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 109 femoro-infrapopliteal grafts undertaken for critical limb ischaemia was analysed to see the difference between vein and PTFE with vein cuff grafts. RESULTS: Vein grafts were superior to PTFE grafts when the whole cohort was included (p = 0.0038); however, there was no significant difference when the patients were stratified for inflow and runoff status. CONCLUSIONS: The difference between vein and PTFE has probably been exaggerated in the past, due to differences in risk factors and in the extent of arterial disease between the two groups of patients. The advantage of vein becomes more significant with time.

9336588|t|The ketogenic diet revisited.
9336588|a|The ketogenic diet is a high-fat diet that maintains the body's starvation mechanism, with exogenous fat provided for metabolism in lieu of stored fat. Mild dehydration is important to prevent dilution of the level of ketones in circulation at any given time. It is not known why or how ketosis affects seizure activity, so the principles behind the therapy have been developed from years of clinical experience and theoretical assumptions. Dietitians are essential providers of ketosis therapy, but the dietitian must work with a physician who understands the theories behind the therapy and is an active member of the ketosis therapy team.

Opportunities exist for research in the areas of solid waste management, global environment, health care reform, and foodservice systems management. Research efforts can focus on cost-effectiveness and medical efficacy of dietary services to improve third-party reimbursement.

9380370|t|Evaluation of Kojima-Matsubara color vision test plates: validity in young children.
9380370|a|PURPOSE: We examined a pseudoisochromatic color plate test by Kojima and Matsubara for young children which uses drawings of familiar objects rather than letters or numbers. First, we evaluated the test's efficacy as a color deficiency screener and its validity in classifying the types of color deficiencies by comparing its results with those from the Moreland anomaloscope. Second, we eliminated the chromatic factor and evaluated the functional ability of young children to perform the task by determining how many correct responses were obtained using modified black/white replicas of the test plates. METHODS: Part 1: Twenty color-normal and 13 color-deficient adults were diagnosed and classified with the Ishihara test, Panel D-15 test, and anomaloscope. Subjects were then tested with the Kojima-Matsubara test and result were compared with those from the anomaloscope. Part 2: Fifty children aged 3 to 7 years were tested with modified black/white test plate replicas. The number of correct responses for each plate was determined for five different age groups. RESULTS: Part 1: Among the 20 color-normal subjects, 18 read all 10 plates correctly and 2 subjects missed 1 of the 10. Only 1 of the 13 color-deficient subjects exhibited the expected responses for plates 2 to 6 (used for color deficiency screening). The color-deficient subjects' responses for plates 7 to 10, which are used to classify red-green defects, were varied and only the protanomalous subjects (n = 2) followed the expected response pattern. Part 2: Of the 10 black/white modified plates, only 2 were correctly identified by all 50 children. The other plates had a recognition rate that ranged from 32 to 98%. CONCLUSIONS: Because the response patterns given by most of the color-deficient adult subjects were different from those in the test manual, ambiguous results would occur if the Kojima-Matsubara test were used for color vision screening or the diagnosis of color deficiency. In addition, the difficulty that many of the young children exhibited in identifying the objects in the black/white replica plates suggests that there would be a large number of false positive errors (classifying a color normal as color deficient) when using this test in young children.

9333208|t|Behavioral and physiological sex differences observed in an animal model of fulminant hepatic encephalopathy in the rat.
9333208|a|Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by a number of neuropsychiatric and motor disturbances observed in patients with liver dysfunction. The purpose of this study is to fully characterize behavioral and physiological sex differences in an animal model of fulminant hepatic encephalopathy (FHE). Male and female rats were administered thioacetamide (600 mg/kg) via i.p. (intraperitoneal) injection at Hours 0 and 24 and allowed to progress into the four stages of FHE. Male rats reached all four stages of FHE significantly earlier than female rats (p < 0.05). The performance of the male rats deteriorated more quickly (p < 0.05) than that of the females in all of the sensory and motor behavioral tests. Sex differences were observed in the liver enzymes of the FHE rats. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in male rats in all four stages of FHE. Significant increases were also observed in the levels of direct and total bilirubin (p < 0.05). Neuronal damage was observed in the CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus. In the CA1 region, male rats displayed greater pathological changes in Stages III and IV (p < 0.05) than female rats. The damage in the CA2 region was only observed in Stage IV male rats. Our data indicate that observable behavioral and physiological sex differences occur in thioacetamide-induced FHE in the rat.

9297630|t|Corticotropin-releasing factor and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus of immune-challenged transgenic mice expressing type II GR antisense ribonucleic acid.
9297630|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the immune activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of transgenic mice with impaired GR function caused by endogenous expression of GR antisense RNA. At 3 and 8 wk of age, control and transgenic mice were sacrificed 4.5 h after a single ip administration of LPS (100 micrograms/100 g of body wt) or vehicle. Frozen brains were mounted on a microtome and cut in 20-microns sections. mRNAs encoding CRF and GR were assayed by in situ hybridization histochemistry using 35S-labeled riboprobes, and localization of Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-ir) nuclei was determined by immunocytochemistry. Basal expression of CRF mRNA in the PVN, central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), and geniculate complex (GN) was similar in the control and transgenic mice. LPS induced a comparable neuronal activation in the PVN of control and transgenic mice as revealed by the number of Fos-ir neurons. Moreover, the endotoxin caused a significant increase in the CRF mRNA levels within the PVN and CeA, an effect observed in both animal models. The endotoxin did not notably modulate CRF expression in other regions, such as GN. Although GR mRNA was expressed in the PVN of control mice under basal conditions, this transcript was not detected in this hypothalamic structure in LPS-treated and transgenic animals. This indicated that endogenous Type II GR mRNA is decreased in the PVN of mice expressing Type II GR antisense RNA and that gene is downregulated by LPS. Hybridization signal for CRF and GR transcripts was not notably altered by the age of mice. These results provide evidence that the basal expression of CRF and the increase of neuroendocrine CRF transcription in response to immunogenic challenges are not significantly affected by impairment of the Type II GR function.

9378611|t|Cerebellar output channels.
9378611|a|The cerebellum has long been regarded as involved in the control of movement, in part through its connections with the cerebral cortex. These connections were thought to combine inputs from widespread regions of the cerebral cortex and "funnel" them into the motor system at the level of the primary motor cortex. Retrograde transneuronal transport of herpes simplex virus type I has recently been used to identify areas of the cerebral cortex that are "directly" influenced by the output of the cerebellum. Results suggest that cerebellar output projects via the thalamus to multiple cortical areas, including premotor and prefrontal cortex, as well as the primary motor cortex. In addition, the projections to different cortical areas appear to originate from distinct regions of the deep cerebellar nuclei. These observations have led to the proposal that cerebellar output is composed of a number of separate "output channels." Evidence from functional imaging studies in humans and single neuron recording studies in monkeys suggests that individual output channels are concerned with different aspects of motor or cognitive behavior.

9348568|a|This phase III study compares leucovorin plus fluorouracil (5-FU) 425 mg/m2, days 1 through 5, 28-day cycle, with oral leucovorin plus oral UFT (tegafur and uracil) 300 mg/m2, days 1 through 28, 35-day cycle, in terms of efficacy, safety, quality of life, and pharmacoeconomics. Eligible patients have not been treated previously and have measurable or evaluable metastatic colorectal cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal functions. Patients are evaluated for response clinically and by computed tomography. Responses are determined by World Health Organization criteria. The study is nearing completion, with no toxicity issues requiring protocol modification. The results of this study could lead to a change to oral therapy as the standard of care for metastatic colorectal cancer, providing the efficacy and toxicity of UFT/leucovorin are at least equivalent due to the ease of administration and patient preference for oral regimens.

9313184|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe women's perceived sense of well-being before and after hysterectomy by examining a broad array of outcomes experienced by women undergoing hysterectomies for benign conditions. DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive. SETTING: A regional tertiary care facility in central Texas. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy-eight women presenting for hysterectomies for nononcologic reasons who completed all three periods of data collection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects completed a questionnaire assessing information pertinent to their current gynecologic health and the SF-36 Health Survey before surgery and of 4 and 11 months after surgery. The women also completed the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale preoperatively and at 4 months postoperatively. Additional demographic and medical information was extracted from the medical record. RESULTS: In the initial period after surgery, the patients experienced an improved health status. In addition, the women reported on improvement in their psychologic well-being, including less depression and improved sexual functioning. Relationships with others also improved after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes for these women undergoing hysterectomy for nononcologic reasons were generally positive. This information is vital for preoperative counseling by nurses of women contemplating or about to undergo this surgery.

9298185|t|Seasonal occurrence of yeasts and yeast-like organisms in the river Danube.
9298185|a|One hundred and seventy yeast strains belonging to 14 genera and 29 species were isolated from 112 water samples of the river Danube in the area of Bratislava. The samples were collected through the year from April to March. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida maltosa, Aureobasidium pullulans, Cystofilobasidium capitatum, Rhodotorula glutinis, Geotrichum candidum, and Candida krusei were the most frequent. The basidiomycetous yeasts and yeast-like organisms with oxidative metabolism were present in approximately equal numbers to those with fermentative metabolism. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the dominant yeast and was isolated from 50% of all samples examined and represented approximately one quarter of the yeast community. Yeast densities ranged from 100 to 21,100 CFU per litre. The highest population density was observed in October. Cryptococcus albidus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula glutinis, and Aureobasidium pullulans formed the main part of the yeast population in this month.

9346625|t|The influence of prostaglandin E1 on platelet adherence and injury in preserved rat liver allografts.
9346625|a|We have previously shown that part of the injury sustained by cold-preserved livers on reperfusion is the consequence of platelet adhesion to sinusoidal endothelium. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) can reduce the injury and if so, how to maximize this beneficial effect. Rat livers were cold-preserved in University of Wisconsin solution for 30 hours then subjected to 1-hour warm ischemia after which they were reperfused at 37 degrees C with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution with or without isolated platelets. PGE1 was used to treat the donor liver during harvesting, cold preservation, and reperfusion. In some studies, PGE1 was used to pretreat platelets before exposing them to the liver, and in other studies, both liver and platelets were treated. Pretreatment of platelets with paraformaldehyde, which inactivates them, or ADP, which activates them, was also studied. Treatment of livers with PGE1 significantly decreased preservation injury when livers were reperfused in the absence of platelets. However, when platelets were added to the perfusate, prior treatment of the liver with PGE1 had relatively minor beneficial effects. Pretreatment of platelets alone with PGE1 was also beneficial, but again the effect was small. However, when both liver and platelets were treated with PGE1 there was a highly significant decrease in the extent of liver injury and platelet adhesion. Perfusate transaminase levels were lower, bile flow was improved, and histologically, livers appeared less injured. Pretreatment of platelets with paraformaldehyde produced similar results to pretreatment with PGE1. When platelets were preactivated with adenosine diphosphate, extensive hepatic injury occurred upon reperfusion despite PGE1 treatment of the liver. PGE1 can lessen preservation-reperfusion injury impressively when administered to both liver and platelets but has little effect when platelets have been preactivated.

9343384|t|Elimination of defective alpha-factor pheromone receptors.
9343384|a|This report compares trafficking routes of a plasma membrane protein that was misfolded either during its synthesis or after it had reached the cell surface. A temperature-sensitive mutant form of the yeast alpha-factor pheromone receptor (ste2-3) was found to provide a model substrate for quality control of plasma membrane proteins. We show for the first time that a misfolded membrane protein is recognized at the cell surface and rapidly removed. When the ste2-3 mutant cells were cultured continuously at 34 degrees C, the mutant receptor protein (Ste2-3p) failed to accumulate at the plasma membrane and was degraded with a half-life of 4 min, compared with a half-life of 33 min for wild-type receptor protein (Ste2p). Degradation of both Ste2-3p and Ste2p required the vacuolar proteolytic activities controlled by the PEP4 gene. At 34 degrees C, Ste2-3p comigrated with glycosylated Ste2p on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that Ste2-3p enters the secretory pathway. Degradation of Ste2-3p did not require delivery to the plasma membrane as the sec1 mutation failed to block rapid turnover. Truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the mutant receptors did not permit accumulation at the plasma membrane; thus, the endocytic signals contained in this domain are unnecessary for intracellular retention. In the pep4 mutant, Ste2-3p accumulated as series of high-molecular-weight species, suggesting a potential role for ubiquitin in the elimination process. When ste2-3 mutant cells were cultured continuously at 22 degrees C, Ste2-3p accumulated in the plasma membrane. When the 22 degrees C culture was shifted to 34 degrees C, Ste2-3p was removed from the plasma membrane and degraded by a PEP4-dependent mechanism with a 24-min half-life; the wild-type Ste2p displayed a 72-min half-life. Thus, structural defects in Ste2-3p synthesized at 34 degrees C are recognized in transit to the plasma membrane, leading to rapid degradation, and Ste2-3p that is preassembled at the plasma membrane is also removed and degraded following a shift to 34 degrees C.

9379007|t|Regulation of C-C chemokine production by murine T cells by CD28/B7 costimulation.
9379007|a|C-C chemokines play an important role in recruitment of T lymphocytes to inflammatory sites. T lymphocytes secrete chemokines, but the activation requirements for chemokine production by T cells are uncertain. We studied the regulation of C-C chemokine production by CD28 costimulatory signals by murine T lymphocytes. Splenocytes from BALB/c mice cultured with anti-CD3 mAb expressed macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha mRNA and secreted MIP-1alpha, which was inhibited by anti-B7-1 plus anti-B7-2 mAbs. MIP-1alpha production by Ag-stimulated T cells from DO.11.10 TCR transgenic mice was augmented by anti-CD28 mAb and increased compared with DO.11.10/CD28(-/-) cells. When T cell costimulation was provided by IL-2, MIP-1alpha was not enhanced. Studies with IL-2, IL-4, STAT4, and STAT6 knock-out mice suggested that chemokine production is controlled by pathways different from those regulating T cell differentiation. Thus, CD28 costimulation may amplify an immune response by stimulating T cell survival, proliferation, and production of chemokines that recruit T cells to inflammatory sites.

9376099|a|OBJECTIVE: To characterize HIV seroprevalence and risk behavior among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 1990 and 1996. DESIGN: We report data from three separate cross-sectional samples of IDUs in Rio de Janeiro: the World Health Organization (WHO) sample (n = 479), the Proviva sample (n = 138) and the Brasil sample (n = 110). These data provide the most comprehensive view available, to date, of this understudied population in Rio. METHODS: Demographic characteristics, HIV/AIDS risk behavior and HIV seroprevalence were compared across the three samples and combined analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with injecting risk behavior, sexual risk behavior and HIV seropositivity. RESULTS: The overall HIV seroprevalence among IDUs was 25%. Two encouraging findings of the present analysis were the lower levels of needle-sharing among participants recruited in the latest years (1995-1996) and the lower HIV seroprevalence in the Proviva sample composed mainly of less educated, poorer IDUs living in deprived neighborhoods. No trends toward safer behavior were found for sexual risk, younger age being the principal factor associated with high risk. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of needle-sharing and sexual risk among IDUs in Rio remain high, demonstrating the urgent need to increase the limited preventive measures undertaken so far. Seroprevalence levels for HIV remain significantly lower in the most deprived sample, arguing for the fundamental importance of prompt and effective prevention strategies to keep infection rates from rising among the poorest and largest strata of Rio's IDUs.

9332329|t|A randomized comparison of liposomal versus conventional amphotericin B for the treatment of pyrexia of unknown origin in neutropenic patients.
9332329|a|One hundred and thirty-four adults and 204 children were randomized in two prospective, parallel comparative multicentre trials to receive either conventional amphotericin B 1 mg/kg/d (c-AMB), liposomal amphotericin B 1 mg/kg/d(L-AMB1) or liposomal amphotericin B 3 mg/ kg/d (L-AMB3). Patients were entered if they had a pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) defined as temperature of 38 degrees C or more, not responding to 96 h of systemic broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, and neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/l). The safety and toxicity of liposomal amphotericin B was compared with that of conventional amphotericin B. Efficacy of treatment was assessed, with success defined as resolution of fever for 3 consecutive days (< 38 degrees C) without the development of any new fungal infection. Clinical and laboratory parameters were collected for safety analysis. In both the paediatric and adult populations, L-AMB treated patients had a 2-6-fold decrease in the incidence (P < or = 0.01) of test-drug-related side-effects, compared to c-AMB. Severe trial-drug-related side-effects were seen in 1% of L-AMB treated patients, in contrast to 12% of patients on c-AMB (P < 0.01). Nephrotoxicity, in the patient subset not receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents, defined as a doubling from the patients baseline serum creatinine level, was not observed in the L-AMB1 arm whereas the incidence was 3% in patients on L-AMB3 and 23% in those on c-AMB (P < 0.01). Moreover, time to develop nephrotoxicity was longer in both L-AMB arms than c-AMB (P < 0.01). Severe hypokalaemia was observed less frequently in both L-AMB arms (P < 0.01). Analysis was by intention-to-treat and included all patients randomized. Success was defined by a minimum of 3 consecutive days with fever (< 38 degrees C) continuing to study end indicated by recovery of neutrophils to 0.5 x 10(9)/l. Addition of systemic antifungal therapy or development of systemic fungal infection were failures as was persistent fever to study end. Efficacy assessments indicated success in 49% of the total group treated with c-AMB, 58% of patients responded to L-AMB1 and 64% to L-AMB3. A statistically significant difference was found between c-AMB and L-AMB3 (P = 0.03) but a Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to differvescence of fever showed there was no significant difference between the arms. It was concluded that liposomal amphotericin at either 1 or 3 mg/kg/d was significantly safer than conventional amphotericin B in children and adults. The main aim of this open-label study was to compare safety between the three trial arms. However, we provide evidence for an equivalent or possibly superior efficacy of liposomal amphotericin with regard to resolution of fever of unknown origin. Subsequent trials should compare amphotericin preparations in defined fungal infections.

9357967|t|Effect of recombinant canine stem cell factor, a c-kit ligand, on hematopoietic recovery after DLA-identical littermate marrow transplants in dogs.
9357967|a|We studied the effect of recombinant canine stem cell factor (rcSCF) on hematopoietic recovery, incidence of graft failure, graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), and survival after marrow transplantation from dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical canine littermates. Ten animals received 100 microg rcSCF/kg/day b.i.d. by subcutaneous injection on days 1 through 10 after 920 cGy total body irradiation and transplantation of a mean of 3.7x10(8) marrow cells/kg body weight. None of the dogs received GVHD prophylaxis. All animals showed hematopoietic engraftment. The median number of days to achieve 1000 neutrophils/mm3 was 9; 100 monocytes/mm3 were reached after 15 days, 500 lymphocytes/mm3 after 21 days, and 20,000 platelets/mm3 after 16 days. One animal developed GVHD involving skin, gut, and liver and died of bacterial pneumonia 21 days after transplantation. The remaining nine dogs were observed for a median of 37 days (range 29-84 days) posttransplantation until they were killed. Facial edema was seen in three dogs during the first 2-3 days of rcSCF administration. These results show that within the limits of this study it appears to be safe to administer SCF after DLA-identical littermate marrow transplants in dogs. Comparison with previously published data in the same model showed that neutrophil and monocyte recovery was significantly faster in dogs receiving SCF treatment compared with dogs without growth factor treatment (recovery to achieve 1000 neutrophils/mm3: median 9 days vs. 13 days, p = 0.002; recovery to 100 monocytes/mm3: median 15 days vs. 105 days, p = 0.0002). Otherwise, no significant differences were seen. Results obtained with SCF treatment were similar to those previously obtained in the same model with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) treatment except that recovery of lymphocytes to 500/mm3 appeared to be more rapid in G-CSF-treated dogs (median 15 days vs. 21 days, p = 0.03).

9326217|t|Cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for a nonpolymorphic proteinase 3 peptide preferentially inhibit chronic myeloid leukemia colony-forming units.
9326217|a|We previously showed that a peptide (PR1) derived from the primary granule enzyme proteinase 3 induced peptide specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in a normal HLA-A2.1+ individual. These CTL showed HLA-restricted cytotoxicity to myeloid leukemias (which overexpress proteinase 3). To further investigate their antileukemic potential, we studied the ability of PR1-specific CTL, derived from two HLA-A2.1+ normal individuals, to inhibit colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) from normal and leukemic individuals. CTL from 20 day PR1 peptide-pulsed lymphocyte cultures showed 89% to 98% HLA-A2.1-restricted colony inhibition of chronic myeloid leukemia targets. Colony formation in normal HLA-A2.1+ bone marrow or HLA-A2.1- CML cells was not inhibited. Sequencing of the exon encoding PR1 showed that colony inhibition was not caused by polymorphic differences in proteinase 3 between effectors and targets. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that proteinase 3 was overexpressed in the leukemia targets compared with normal marrow targets (median channel fluorescence 1,399 v 298, P = .009). These results show that PR1-specific allogeneic T cells preferentially inhibit leukemic CFU-GM based on overexpression of proteinase 3, and that proteinase 3-specific CTL could be used for leukemia-specific adoptive immunotherapy.

The prognosis of patients who underwent IOR with/without resection was significantly longer than for patients without IOR (p < 0.0001). Better pain relief was obtained by IOR. Although a randomized prospective study is required, resection and IOR will be the central treatment modalities for carcinoma of the body and tail of the pancreas.

9325342|a|The full-length cDNA for the rat recombinant synaptic vesicle monoamine transporter (rVMAT2) containing a COOH-terminal polyhistidine epitope was engineered into baculovirus DNA for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. Using this recombinant baculovirus and cultured Sf9 cells, rVMAT2 has been expressed to high levels and purified to >95% homogeneity using immobilized Ni2+-affinity chromatography followed by lectin (concanavalin A) chromatography. Purified transporter was photolabeled using [125I]-7-azido-8-iodoketanserin ([125I]AZIK) and [125I]2-N-[(3'-iodo-4'-azidophenyl)propionyl]tetrabenazine ([125I]TBZ-AIPP). Both [125I]AZIK and [125I]TBZ-AIPP photoaffinity labeling of purified rVMAT2 were protectable by 10 microM tetrabenazine (TBZ), 10 microM 7-aminoketanserin, and 1 mM concentrations of the transporter substrates dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Radiolabeled peptides were generated using enzymatic and chemical methods, purified using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and NH2-terminal microsequenced. Radiosequencing of [125I]AZIK-labeled rVMAT2 indicated derivatization of Lys-20 in the NH2 terminus, just prior to putative transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1). [125I]TBZ-AIPP derivatized a segment of rVMAT2 between Gly-408 and Cys-431 in TMD10 and 11. These data implicate juxtaposition of TMD1 and 10/11.

9301342|t|Politics, science, and the emergence of a new disease. The case of chronic fatigue syndrome.
9301342|a|Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) emerged as a diagnostic category during the last decade. Initial research suggested that CFS was a relatively rare disorder with a high level of psychiatric comorbidity. Many physicians minimized the seriousness of this disorder and also interpreted the syndrome as being equivalent to a psychiatric disorder. These attitudes had negative consequences for the treatment of CFS. By the mid-1990s, findings from more representative epidemiological studies indicated considerably higher CFS prevalence rates. However, the use of the revised CFS case definition might have produced heterogeneous patient groups, possibly including some patients with pure psychiatric disorders. Social scientists have the expertise to more precisely define this syndrome and to develop appropriate and sensitive research strategies for understanding this disease.

9353195|t|A low-barrier hydrogen bond in the catalytic triad of serine proteases? Theory versus experiment.
9353195|a|Cleland and Kreevoy recently advanced the idea that a special type of hydrogen bond (H-bond), termed a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB), may account for the "missing" transition state stabilization underlying the catalytic power of many enzymes, and Frey et al. have proposed that the H-bond between aspartic acid 102 and histidine 57 in the catalytic triad of serine proteases is an example of a catalytically important LBHB. Experimental facts are here considered regarding the aspartic acid-histidine and cis-urocanic H-bonds that are inconsistent with fundamental tenets of the LBHB hypothesis. The inconsistencies between theory and experiment in these paradigm systems cast doubt on the existence of LBHBs, as currently defined, within enzyme active sites.

Also, the resistance patterns of A. eucrenophila were tested especially in relation to ampicillin. None of the A. eucrenophila strains caused fluid accumulation in the initial tests, however, they did so only after one to four sequential passages through the gut of a susceptible host. All the strains of A. eucrenophila showed beta-haemolytic activities. Production of beta-haemolysin could be correlated with enterotoxicity. Since all the strains of A. eucrenophila were resistant to ampicillin, media containing this antibiotic may be used for their isolation from diverse sources.

9335460|t|Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural investigation of the human vestibular dark cell area: roles of subepithelial capillaries and T lymphocyte-melanophage interaction in an immune surveillance system.
9335460|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to morphologically characterize the structure of the subepithelial blood vessels in the dark cell area of the human vestibular organs, and to determine whether immunocompetent cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes could be found around these small blood vessels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 31 surgical specimens (semicircular canals and utricles) were obtained from patients with vestibular schwannoma. Formalin fixed specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and with antibodies to von Willebrand Factor (vWF), leukocyte common antigen (LCA), and UCHL-1, and were examined with light microscope. Specimens fixed with glutaraldehyde were examined with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). OBJECTIVES: Subepithelial blood vessels stained positive for vWF. By TEM observation, these blood vessels were observed to be capillaries that consisted of non-fenestrated endothelium, occasional pericytes, and a basement membrane. They were usually accompanied by melanophages with a number of secondary lysosomes containing phagocytosed degraded melanosomes and lipid droplets. Moreover, melanocytes and their cell processes directly surrounded these subepithelial capillaries. The fact that cells which were positively stained with LCA and UCHL-1 were present both in the intra- and subepithelial layer of the specimens, and that by TEM the intra- and subepithelial mononuclear cells with a lymphoid appearance had clustered dense bodies in their cytoplasm, suggested that they were a population of T lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggested the possibility of a T lymphocyte-melanophage (macrophage) interaction, both originating from and harbored around subepithelial capillaries, which suggests the presence of an immune surveillance system in the human vestibular organs.

9331078|t|Skin autografts in epidermodysplasia verruciformis: human papillomavirus-associated cutaneous changes need over 20 years for malignant conversion.
9331078|a|Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is regarded as a model for cutaneous oncogenesis associated with specific human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Because genital HPV-associated carcinogenesis is a very long-lasting process requiring 20-30 years and epidemiological studies of this type for HPV-associated skin cancers are impossible in such a rare disease as EV, we observed for up to 20 years EV patients having surgery for carcinomas with consecutive autografts from uninvolved and non-sun-exposed skin. We noticed the appearance of premalignant and malignant changes around the grafts, whereas within the grafted skin, only benign macular lesions started to develop several years after transplantation. Thus, skin HPV-associated carcinogenesis appears to be a very slow process comparable to the genital carcinogenesis associated with high risk HPVs.

9325282|t|Covalent modification of the regulatory domain irreversibly stimulates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.
9325282|a|The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel is regulated by three cytosolic domains, the regulatory domain (R domain) and two nucleotide binding domains. To learn more about how the cytosolic domains regulate channel activity, we used chemical modification to probe their structure. When we applied the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and other N-substituted maleimides to the cytosolic domains, we found that they rapidly and irreversibly stimulated channel activity. CFTR contains 14 intracellular cysteine residues that might be targets for NEM modification. We identified one, Cys832, that was essential for the response. Cys832 is located in the R domain. Single channel studies showed that NEM stimulated CFTR by increasing the duration of bursts of activity and by shortening the closed interval between bursts. At the single channel level, CFTR in which Cys832 was mutated to alanine behaved identically to wild-type CFTR, except that it failed to respond to NEM. Additional studies showed that NEM modification increased the potency of ATP-mediated stimulation. Previous work has shown that modification of the R domain by phosphorylation, which introduces negative charge, or replacement of multiple serines by negatively charged aspartates stimulates the channel. Our current data show that covalent modification of the R domain with a neutral, hydrophobic adduct at a site that is not phosphorylated can also stimulate CFTR. This finding suggests that an alteration in the conformation of the R domain may be a key feature that regulates channel activity.

9382073|t|Multifocal hepatic lesions in AIDS: an unusual presentation of steatosis.
9382073|a|Patients infected with HIV frequently have abnormal results on liver tests, leading to radiographic evaluation for hepatic lesions. The etiology of these lesions in patients infected with HIV is most often secondary to infections or tumors. Occasionally, focal abnormalities in the liver are identified in asymptomatic patients. The etiology and clinical course in this subset of patients are not known. However, because of concerns of tumor, an evaluation is usually warranted. We report an unusual case of multifocal hepatic steatosis presenting as multiple liver lesions in an HIV-positive patient with cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma. This case emphasizes the importance of obtaining a tissue diagnosis in this patient population.

9377881|t|Patient-ventilator flow dyssynchrony: flow-limited versus pressure-limited breaths.
9377881|a|OBJECTIVES: Patient-ventilator flow dyssynchrony occurs when ventilator flow delivery is insufficient to meet patient demands. If sufficiently severe, flow dyssynchrony can produce significant imposed loads on ventilatory muscles. Flow dyssynchrony can be improved by increasing ventilator flow delivery. We hypothesized that the variable flow pressure-limited breath would be a better approach for matching patient flow demands than adjusting a set flow on a conventional volume-cycled breath. DESIGN: Clinical interventional study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Sixteen stable, mechanically ventilated patients receiving volume-cycled assist-control ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: Flow dyssynchrony was produced by reducing the set flow by 50%. Dyssynchrony was quantified by measuring the esophageal pressure time product during the assisted breath. Two strategies were then employed in an attempt to reduce the dyssynchrony. One strategy was to increase flow back to the initial set flow and then further increase flow by an additional 25% (VI strategy). The other strategy was to use a pressure-limited breath feature coupled to a volume assist breath (the P strategy). With the P strategy, the pressure limit was set at 75% and 100% of the static elastic recoil pressure at end-inspiration. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pressure time product, intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, and the ventilatory pattern were measured with each strategy and were analyzed by analysis of variance. Induced baseline flow dyssynchrony, as measured by the pressure time product, was > 5 cm H2O/sec in ten of 16 patients. This dyssynchrony was significantly reduced by both the VI strategy and the P strategy, although the P strategy appeared to be more effective in those patients with the greatest baseline dyssynchrony. Baseline inspiratory time was also shortened by both the VI strategy and the P strategy; the VI strategy shortened baseline inspiratory time more than the P strategy. Baseline tidal volume, frequency, and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure were only minimally affected by either strategy. CONCLUSION: The pressure-limited, variable-flow approach to ventilator gas delivery appears to be more responsive to a vigorous patient effort than a fixed-flow approach.

9315229|t|Ets oncogene family.
9315229|a|First member of Ets gene family was discovered a decade ago by studying avian erythroblastosis virus, E26. This virus encodes a tripartite protein gag-myb-ets with a molecular weight of 135 kDa. Subsequently, a series of cellular Ets genes were isolated (Ets-1, Ets-2, Erg, Elk-1, Sap-1, PEA-3, PU.1, Fli-1, Pok/Yan, Etv-1 etc.). These genes share sequence homology to E26 Ets gene (v-ets or viral ets). Ets genes are highly conserved in phylogenetically divergent species from Drosophila to man. Mammalian Ets genes are located on different chromosomes. Ets gene products are transcriptionally active sequence-specific DNA binding proteins and are differentially regulated. Ets genes are involved in certain chromosomal translocations leading to the formation of chimeric fusion proteins that are associated with certain leukemias and soft tissue cancers. Ets genes also have a role in T-cell development and molecular and genetic analysis of Down Syndrome patients have implicated the human Ets-2 and Erg genes in the disease. Down Syndrome afflicted patients have immunologic and thymic disorders as well as a greater risk for leukemic disease. Thus, Ets genes having homology to viral oncogenes, may be instrumental in regulating cellular growth and differentiation, as well as organismal development. Alteration of these genes and their products may cause deregulation of normal cell growth and differentiation and result in a disease.

9261855|a|A previously healthy and asymptomatic 7-year-old white boy presented with a history of two episodes of hemoptysis productive of bright red blood in the 5 days preceding admission. After admission he developed massive hemoptysis that, on bronchoscopy, was noted to be emanating from the right lower lobe. An emergency right lower lobe resection was done. Pathological examination revealed hilar adenopathy and peripheral lesions with caseating granulomas containing yeast, morphologically consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum.

9336559|t|Review of self-efficacy and locus of control for nutrition- and health-related behavior.
9336559|a|This article reviews several cognitive predictors of health- and diet-related behaviors commonly used in theories and models of nutrition and health behavior change. Constructs such as self-efficacy, self-esteem, outcome expectancies, health value, and locus of control are examined. Self-efficacy has repeatedly been a good predictor of health behavior, sometimes explaining more than 50% of variability. Research on locus of control and other predictive factors has been less conclusive. The take-home message is threefold: (a) task specificity of self-efficacy and domain specificity of locus of control are crucial for unraveling their effects on behavior; (b) careful segmentation of different population groups under study may explain the inconsistencies in previous research; and (c) especially when studying dietary behavior, these predictors of behavior change should not be used alone or in place of one another but should be used simultaneously to explain complex food and diet-related behaviors. We recommend that nutritionists systematically integrate available theories and models and explore new areas for studying human behavior, such as sociology and anthropology, to form a more powerful, comprehensive model for behavior change.

9281438|t|Different responses of non-ischemic and post-ischemic myocardium towards Ca2+ sensitization.
9281438|a|We tested whether decreased Ca2+ sensitivity is a major cause for dysfunctional stunned myocardium. The experiments employed a novel Ca2+ sensitizing agent: the thiadiazinone derivative EMD 60 263. Experiments were done on 14 isolated, blood-perfused rabbit hearts. After control, seven hearts were subjected to 20 min no-flow ischemia, and then allowed to recover during 30 min reperfusion. Thereafter, EMD 60 263 was administered (3, 10 and 30 microm). For comparison, the effect of the same doses was investigated in seven non-ischemic hearts. At the low dose, the agent improved ventricular systolic function in the post-ischemic group significantly (LVPmax: 65+/-13 v 91+/-17 mmHg; dP/dtmax: 845+/-235 v 1300+/-350 mmHg/s), and non-significantly in the non-ischemic group (LVPmax: 115+/-35 v 132+/-39 mmHg; dP/dtmax: 1415+/-545 v 1885+/-720 mmHg/s). Early relaxation (dP/dtmin) was slightly improved in both groups (800+/-225 v 1050+/-220 mmHg/s post-ischemic; 1120+/-315 v 1205+/-285 mmHg/s non-ischemic). Heart rate was increased (151+/-35 v 175+/-45 beats/min) in the post-ischemic group and was unaffected in the non-ischemic group. At the higher dose, systolic ventricular function in the post-ischemic group was further improved (LVPmax: 109+/-17 mmHg, dP/dtmax: 1330+/-180 mmHg/s), but tended to decrease in the non-ischemic group (LVPmax: 121+/-40 mmHg, dP/dtmax: 1605+/-680 mmHg/s). This dose decreased heart rate in both groups (133+/-34 and 134+/-23 beats/min). 30 microm EMD 60 263 had deleterious effects in both groups. The different responses towards Ca2+ sensitization suggest that a decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity might play a role in dysfunctional stunned myocardium. Therefore, Ca2+ sensitizing agents of the thiadiazinone type could be useful to recruit a positive inotropic reserve in stunned myocardium.

9313157|t|Effect of starch on the bioavailability of glutamine and leucine in the dairy cow.
9313157|a|This experiment was designed to quantify changes in utilization of Gln and Leu by the gut wall as a result of changes in the starch supply to the duodenum. Four dairy cows fitted with cannulas in the rumen and the distal duodenum were adapted for 3 wk to starch infusion, either into the rumen (600 g/d of flaked maize) or into the duodenum (300 g/d of flaked maize plus 300 g/d of maize meal), in a 2 x 2 crossover design. Absorption and elimination kinetics and the relative bioavailability of Gln and Leu were measured during wk 4 and 5. After infusion of 50 g of Gln or 10 g of Leu into the duodenum or jugular vein, blood samples were taken from the jugular vein at 0.5-h intervals up to 4 h after infusion. Concentrations of Gln and Leu in plasma fitted best to an open, one-compartment model (duodenal infusion) or to an open, two-compartment model (i.v. infusion). Both amino acids were rapidly absorbed; half-life times were less than 20 min. The amount of Gln trapped in the splanchnic bed was higher than the amount of Leu trapped in the splanchnic bed. Site of starch infusion did not affect the relative bioavailability of amino acids.

9344581|t|Inhibition of retinoic acid receptor function in normal human mammary epithelial cells results in increased cellular proliferation and inhibits the formation of a polarized epithelium in vitro.
9344581|a|The expression of retinoic acid receptor-beta (RAR beta) mRNA is absent or down-regulated in a majority of breast cancers, suggesting that loss of retinoic acid receptor function may be a critical event in breast cancer carcinogenesis. We developed an in vitro system to investigate whether the loss of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) function might affect the proliferation and structural differentiation of normal cultured human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Utilizing a truncated retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-alpha construct exhibiting dominant-negative activity against retinoic acid receptor isoforms alpha, beta, and gamma (DNRAR), we inhibited normal retinoic acid receptor function in HMECs. Suppression of RAR function in HMECs resulted in reduced growth inhibition mediated by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Moreover, the doubling time of HMECs expressing the DNRAR was significantly shortened, associated with a decrease in the percentage of cells in G1 and an increase in the percentage of cells in S-phase relative to controls. In addition, HMECs expressing the DNRAR cultured in prepared extracellular matrix exhibited a loss of extracellular matrix-induced growth arrest and formation of a polarized ductal epthelium. Our results suggest that ATRA and RARs may play an important role in regulating the proliferation of HMECs and in promoting differentiation.

9380472|t|Concentration of cefuroxime in middle ear effusion of children with acute otitis media.
9380472|a|BACKGROUND: Antibiotic concentrations in serum and middle ear effusion are important in determining therapeutic success in acute otitis media. For beta-lactams the most relevant pharmacokinetic index for clinical efficacy is the time for which serum concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen, which should be at least 40 to 50% of the dosing interval. METHODS: In this open, single center study, the concentration of cefuroxime achieved in the serum and middle ear effusion of pediatric acute otitis media patients with purulent effusion was assessed between 2 and 5 h after a single oral dose of 15 mg/kg cefuroxime axetil suspension. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of cefuroxime ranged from 2.8 to 7.3 microg/ml and were consistent with the results of previous pharmacokinetic study. These results show that serum concentrations of cefuroxime remain above the MIC90 (2.0 microg/ml) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis for at least 5 h (42%) of the 12-h dosing interval. Cefuroxime was detected in 14 of 17 (82%) middle ear effusion samples and ranged from 0.2 to 3.6 microg/ml, indicating that cefuroxime penetrates well into the middle ear. CONCLUSIONS: Cefuroxime is well-absorbed and penetrates well into the middle ear after oral administration of cefuroxime axetil suspension.

9357761|t|Cloning and functional expression of a ClC Cl- channel from the renal cell line A6.
9357761|a|Cl- channels are important for ion transport and cell volume regulation in A6 renal cells. In the present study, we used reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to identify proteins homologous to ClC Cl- channel proteins in A6 cells. Using degenerate primers designed on consensus sequences for members of the ClC family, we amplified an RT-PCR product that had significant homology to the ClC sequences. RACE-PCR was then used to isolate several full-length clones that had total lengths from 2,764 to 3,016 base pairs. Although the coding regions were identical, sequence differences occurred in the 5' noncoding regions. The amino acid sequences of the clones had high homologies to rat and human ClC-5 (85 and 84%, respectively, if the 5th methionine of the open reading frame represents the start codon). Three parts of the protein (53, 80, and 63 amino acids in length) were 97-100% homologous to the mammalian sequences. Ribonuclease protection assay analysis revealed mRNA for this protein in oocytes, kidney, intestine, liver, brain, and blood, with lower amounts in stomach, muscle, and skin. Expression of the clones in Xenopus laevis oocytes resulted in an outwardly rectifying Cl- current that was inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and possessed an anion selectivity of I- > Cl- >> gluconate.

9285033|t|Williams syndrome--the Singapore General Hospital experience.
9285033|a|Williams syndrome first described in 1961 is generally characterised by mental deficiency, gregarious personality, unusual "elfin" facies, supravalvular aortic stenosis and idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia. Patients with Williams syndrome show a hemizygous submicroscopic deletion of 7q11.23 detectable by fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH). The deleted portion of the chromosome corresponds to the Elastin gene. We report 3 girls with characteristics of Williams syndrome in whom the diagnosis was confirmed by demonstration of the hemizygous deletion of 7q11.23 in the karyotype by FISH. These patients, aged 6, 7 and 10 years, showed the characteristic facies and gregarious personalities. Some developmental delay with mild mental deficiency and dysmorphic facies were prominent features in the initial presentation. Cardiac lesions found in these patients were small patent ductus arteriosus which closed, pulmonary valvular stenosis and mitral valve prolapse associated with mitral regurgitation respectively. Hypercalcaemia was not documented in these patients. Learning difficulty was a major issue and all patients required special schooling. Chromosome analyses done on peripheral blood were found to be normal in all patients. FISH using the Elastin Williams Syndrome Chromosome Region (WSCR) probes (oncor) showed the hemizygous deletion of 7q11.23. Diagnosis of Williams syndrome can now be confidently confirmed with the help of FISH.

9287109|a|To isolate Arabidopsis cDNAs that encode signal transducers and components involved in the regulation of meiosis, a trans-complementation analysis was performed using a Schizosaccharomyces pombe meiosis-defective mutant in which the genes for pheromone receptors were disabled. One cDNA obtained in this screening encodes a polypeptide, named AML1, that shows significant similarity to S. pombe Mei2 protein and has three putative RNA-recognition motifs like as Mei2. Mei2 is involved in the regulation of meiosis in fission yeast. Northern blot analysis showed that the AML1 gene is expressed in each organ. The possible functions of AML1 are discussed.

9381776|t|[The Holt-Oram syndrome. Review of the literature and current orthopedic treatment concepts]
9381776|a|PROBLEM: The clinical manifestation of the Holt-Oram-syndrome (HOS) shows congenital heart-disease and anomalies of the upper limb. The inheritance of this syndrome is autosomal dominant. The question arise, as to whether a contemporary orthopedic concept of treatment could developed based on own experiences and data from the literature. METHODS: We revised data from five patients with HOS treated at the Clinic for Orthopaedics of the University of Heidelberg. The review of the literature revealed a comprehensive and detailed picture of the clinical syndrome and, furthermore, information in respect to a comparative analysis of methods of treatments. RESULTS: Our patients showed characteristic cardiac anomalies, i.e. atrio and ventricular septal defects, and persisting Botall's duct (three cases). The types of malformation of the upper limb corresponded with those found in the literature. Furthermore the indication for amputation of rudimentary or hypoplastic fingers in the Heidelberg clinic was in accordance with the clinical treatments described worldwide. CONCLUSION: The type of treatment of the clubhand in cases with HOS depends on (1) the age and (2) the pattern and degree of accompanying malformations of the upper limb. For patients with aplasia of the thumb or amputation of a rudimental one we recommend pollicisation of the index finger to improve its function.

9306153|t|Ouabain effects on activated lymphocytes: augmentation of CD25 expression on TPA-stimulated cells and of CD69 on PHA-and TPA-stimulated cells.
9306153|a|Ouabain (OUA) was capable of inhibiting peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) proliferation induced by phyothaemagglutinin (PHA) of phorbol ester (TPA), as measured by thymidine incorporation or cell cycle analysis. In this latter case it was possible to detect a block in the progression from G1 to S phase. This inhibition could not be reversed by interleukin (IL)-2 and was not due to an effect on CD 25 expression, as this molecule was only reduced in PHA cultures treated with OUA. Conversely, cultures activated by TPA and OUA showed an increased expression of CD25. The activation antigen CD69 was increased in both situation, suggesting that despite the absence of proliferative response the cells were being activated. The possibility that these cells were being deviated to the activation pathway leading to apoptosis is now under investigation. This study also suggested that CD25 induction may occur via different pathways, and that the selective effect of OUA for PHA-activated cells may become a useful tool for the understanding of the process.

9337957|t|Plasma noradrenaline response to electroconvulsive therapy in depressive illness.
9337957|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of catecholaminergic function have been hypothesised to cause depressive illness. Plasma noradrenaline can be used as a marker of central noradrenergic activity. It is of interest to examine the change in resting plasma noradrenaline in patients with depressive illness over a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and relate this to their clinical state. METHOD: Patients referred for ECT who suffered from DSM-III-R major depressive disorder or dysthymia were recruited. Blood samples were taken before and after each treatment, during a course of ECT, to measure plasma noradrenaline and cortisol. Clinical ratings were carried out weekly during the course of ECT. RESULTS: Plasma noradrenaline fell significantly in those patients with melancholic/psychotic depressions but increased in those with non-melancholic depressive illness. There was a strong trend indicating that a fall in plasma noradrenaline was associated with improvement in depression ratings in the melancholic/psychotic patients only. CONCLUSIONS: Electroconvlusive therapy decreases plasma noradrenaline in melancholic/psychotic depressive illness and this shows a trend associated with clinical improvement.

9351726|t|Effect of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on mortality rate in patients not revascularized after myocardial infarction: data from a large HMO.
9351726|a|We investigated whether patients who do not undergo coronary angiography and therefore any form of revascularization after a myocardial infarction derive greater benefit from chronic beta-blocker therapy than patients who undergo coronary angiography. With multivariate analyses, treatment with beta-blockers was a much stronger predictor of survival in patients who did not undergo coronary angiography (relative risk = 0.38, p = 0.005) than in those patients who did undergo catheterization (p < 0.05 for interaction). Our findings provide direct support for the recommendation by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force that beta-blocker therapy should be initiated for all infarct survivors who do not undergo revascularization and who have no contraindications.

9302538|t|Sexual assault history and health perceptions: seven general population studies.
9302538|a|This article uses data from 7 population surveys to evaluate the association of sexual assault history with health perceptions. It estimates the extent of generalizability across gender, ethnic groups, and studies; the extent to which depression accounts for or mediates the association; and whether some circumstances of assault are more strongly related to poor subjective health. Data from each of 18 subsamples of the surveys were analyzed (pooled N = 10,001; 7,550 women and 2,451 men), and results were combined by using meta-analysis. Assault was associated with poor subjective health (odds ratio [OR] = 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36, 1.95) and this result was consistent regardless of gender, ethnicity, or sample. Controlling depression did not markedly change this result (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.21, 1.77), indicating that depression did not account for or mediate the assault-health perceptions association. Multiple assaults and assaults by strangers or spouse were most strongly associated with poor subjective health.

9259208|t|Development of intracoronary local adhesive delivery technique.
9259208|a|Acute coronary occlusion may occur in weak coronary atherosclerotic lesions, including dissection, ulceration or thrombus. In some cases of occlusion "bail-out" is performed by using recently developed New Devices. However, these have not yet completely solved the problem to this end, we designed a new method of coronary revascularization, the Intracoronary Local Adhesive Delivery Technique, utilizing antithrombotic and absorbable adhesive injected locally into the fragile and morbid arterial wall using a drug delivery PTCA catheter more flexible than the existing New Devices. This adhesive strengthened and hardened the lesions. In this study, we examined the efficacy of making an adhesive cylinder in arteries of similar size to the coronary, through acute animal experiments using the existing clinical adhesives and drug delivery PTCA catheters and 12 femoral arteries of adult goats. We were successful in forming firm tunnels along the inside of six arteries, infused with approximately 0.04 ml Cyanoacrylate. These tunnels were observed with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging and evaluated microscopically. These results suggest the feasibility of this method as a new approach for making synthetic resinous stents.

9325340|t|Binding properties of neuroligin 1 and neurexin 1beta reveal function as heterophilic cell adhesion molecules.
9325340|a|beta-Neurexins and neuroligins are plasma membrane proteins that are displayed on the neuronal cell surface. We have now investigated the interaction of neurexin 1beta with neuroligin 1 to evaluate their potential to function as heterophilic cell adhesion molecules. Using detergent-solubilized neuroligins and secreted neurexin 1beta-IgG fusion protein, we observed binding of these proteins to each other only in the presence of Ca2+ and in no other divalent cation tested. Only neurexin 1beta lacking an insert in splice site 4 bound neuroligins, whereas neurexin 1beta containing an insert was inactive. Half-maximal binding required 1-3 microM free Ca2+, which probably acts by binding to neuroligin 1 but not to neurexin 1beta. To determine if neurexin 1beta and neuroligin 1 can also interact with each other when present in a native membrane environment on the cell surface, we generated transfected cell lines expressing neuroligin 1 and neurexin 1beta. Upon mixing different cell populations, we found that cells aggregate only if cells expressing neurexin 1beta are mixed with cells expressing neuroligin 1. Aggregation was dependent on Ca2+ and was inhibited by the addition of soluble neurexin 1beta lacking an insert in splice site 4 but not by the addition of neurexin 1beta containing an insert in splice site 4. We conclude that neurexin 1beta and neuroligin 1 (and, by extension, other beta-neurexins and neuroligins) function as heterophilic cell adhesion molecules in a Ca2+-dependent reaction that is regulated by alternative splicing of beta-neurexins.

9378512|t|Selective use of calcium chelators enhances the yield of calcium-tolerant myocytes from adult heart.
9378512|a|Isolation of viable and functional cells from adult heart remains an intriguing problem for investigators who choose to use the cardiomyocyte model for experimental studies. With a few modifications of the existing procedures we have been able to improve the yield of ventricular myocardial cells from the adult rat heart. Sarcolemmal damage leading to hypercontracture due to Ca2+ loading appears to be the major hindrance to the successful isolation of sufficient number of viable cells. The two crucial steps are found to be the pre-enzymatic perfusion for Ca(2+)-depletion and the final step of Ca(2+)-repletion in extracellular medium for the isolation of Ca(2+)-tolerant myocytes. Inclusion of EGTA and taurine during the initial perfusion of Ca(2+)-free medium and of trypsin during reintroduction of Ca2+ led to a considerable increase in the yield of Ca(2+)-tolerant myocytes. The contraction amplitude and speed of shortening and relaxation of isolated cells were measured using an edge detection device. Selective use of calcium ion chelators appears to have a beneficial effect on the isolation of Ca(2+)-tolerant myocytes.

9300300|t|Cultured adult rabbit myocytes: effect of adding supplements to the medium, and response to isoprenaline.
9300300|a|INTRODUCTION: The aims of this study were to investigate: (1) the effect of supplementing the culture medium on preservation of L-type calcium channel current (1Ca,L) in adult rabbit ventricular myocytes cultured for 4 days; and (2) preservation of the ICa,L response in cultured myocytes to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult rabbit myocytes were cultured on laminin-pretreated glass coverslips. The basic, serum-free culture medium was supplemented with 2 mM L-carnitine, 5 mM creatine, and 5 mM taurine. Myocytes were whole cell patch-clamped, and the L-type Ca channel current was recorded selectively as Ba flux (IBa,L) via the channels. IBa,L density (i.e., IBa,L amplitude normalized to membrane capacitance) in myocytes maintained in supplemented medium did not change significantly during culture (P > 0.1). By comparison, IBa,L density in myocytes cultured in nonsupplemented medium declined by 36% after 24 hours in culture (day 1) and then recovered by the fourth day (day 4). There was no significant difference in the response to isoprenaline of acutely isolated myocytes and 4-day cultured myocytes. Isoprenaline 100 nM increased peak IBa,L by 149% +/- 32% (mean +/- SEM) in acutely isolated myocytes (n = 4 cells), and by 224% +/- 60% (n = 6 cells) and 159% +/- 24% (n = 8 cells) in day 1 and 4 cultured myocytes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Supplemented medium improved IBa,L density in cultured myocytes. beta-Adrenergic receptors and intracellular messenger pathways appear to remain intact in adult rabbit myocytes cultured for up to 4 days.

9326653|t|Panhandle PCR strategy to amplify MLL genomic breakpoints in treatment-related leukemias.
9326653|a|Panhandle PCR amplifies genomic DNA with known 5' and unknown 3' sequences from a template with an intrastrand loop schematically shaped like a pan with a handle. We used panhandle PCR to clone MLL genomic breakpoints in two pediatric treatment-related leukemias. The karyotype in a case of treatment-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed the t(4;11)(q21;q23). Panhandle PCR amplified the translocation breakpoint at position 2158 in intron 6 in the 5' MLL breakpoint cluster region (bcr). The karyotype in a case of treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia was normal, but Southern blot analysis showed a single MLL gene rearrangement. Panhandle PCR amplified the breakpoint at position 1493 in MLL intron 6. Screening of somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid DNAs by PCR and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of the leukemic cells indicated that panhandle PCR identified a fusion of MLL intron 6 with a previously uncharacterized sequence in MLL intron 1, consistent with a partial duplication. In both cases, the breakpoints in the MLL bcr were in Alu repeats, and there were Alu repeats in proximity to the breakpoints in the partner DNAs, suggesting that Alu sequences were relevant to these rearrangements. This study shows that panhandle PCR is an effective method for cloning MLL genomic breakpoints in treatment-related leukemias. Analysis of additional pediatric cases will determine whether breakpoint distribution deviates from the predilection for 3' distribution in the bcr that has been found in adult cases.

9322741|t|Isolation and expression pattern of hahr1, a homeobox-containing cDNA from Helianthus annuus.
9322741|a|A 2.5 kb homeobox (HB)-containing cDNA (hahr1) was isolated from a library prepared from rootlets of Helianthus annuus using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy. The putative protein product (77 kDa) contains the homeodomain (HD) and an acidic domain at the N-terminal region (residues 72-155). The deduced amino acid sequence of hahr1 shares a 53% sequence identity with GLABRA2, a HD protein associated with epidermal cell differentiation. Hahr1 expression was primarily found in dry seeds, hypocotyls and roots at stages associated with early developmental events. Expression was completely lacking in leaves and flowers. Evidence for the existence of one related gene expressed in sunflower stems was obtained by the presence of restriction fragment length polymorphism of amplified cDNA products.

9376223|t|Agonist-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of isoforms of the shc adapter protein by the delta opioid receptor.
9376223|a|Maximally effective concentrations of the opioid agonist D-ala2-D-leu5-enkephalin resulted in some 2-3-fold enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation of the p52 Shc adapter protein in a clone of Rat-1 fibroblasts transfected to express stably the murine delta opioid receptor. More limited modifications of the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the p46 and p66 forms of Shc were observed in parallel. Epidermal growth factor caused some 10-12-fold enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation of p52 Shc and marked increases in the p46 and p66 forms. The effect of D-ala2-D-leu5-enkephalin was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin and was not observed in non-transfected parental fibroblasts whereas the effect of epidermal growth factor was still manifest in both these situations. Half-maximal effects of D-ala2-D-leu5-enkephalin on p52 Shc tyrosine phosphorylation were produced with sub-nanomolar concentrations, in agreement with previous results on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p44MAPK (Burt et al., 1996). p52 Shc became tyrosine phosphorylated more rapidly than p44MAPK in response to D-ala2-D-leu5-enkephalin and its enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation was maintained for at least 10 min.

9352845|t|Physician specialty and variations in the cost of treating patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
9352845|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding is a frequent cause of hospitalization. The goal of this study was to assess whether the cost of treating patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding varies among surgeons, internists, and gastroenterologists. METHODS: A retrospective study of 124 patients admitted with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was performed. Patients were stratified into three groups based on a validated risk score; length of stay and hospital costs were compared among patients primarily cared for by internists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. RESULTS: The median length of stay (2 days) for patients admitted to the gastroenterology service was significantly shorter than for patients admitted under the care of other physicians (P < 0.05). The median hospitalization cost ($2856) for patients admitted to the gastroenterology service was significantly lower than for patients admitted to the other services (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in the time to endoscopy among services. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted to an urban teaching hospital directly under the care of a gastroenterologist had shorter hospital stays that were significantly less costly than patients under the primary care of internists or surgeons. The difference in length of stay reflects the time interval between endoscopy and discharge.

9312208|t|Red blood cells of a transgenic mouse expressing high levels of human hemoglobin S exhibit deoxy-stimulated cation flux.
9312208|a|Deoxy-stimulated cation fluxes have been implicated in the generation of the dense and irreversibly sickled red blood cells (RBCs) in patients homozygous for hemoglobin S (SS). We now report on the effect of short term deoxygenation on K+ and Na+ transport in RBCs from control mice (C57Bl/6J) and a transgenic (alphaHbetaS[betaMDD]) mouse line that expresses high levels of human alphaH and betaS-chains and has a small percent dense cells but does not exhibit anemia. In transgenic mouse RBCs (n = 5) under oxygenated conditions, K+ efflux was 0.22 +/- 0.01 mmol/L cell x min and Na+ influx was 0.17 +/- 0.02 mmol/L cell x min. Both fluxes were stimulated by 10 min deoxygenation in transgenic but not in control mice. The deoxy-stimulated K+ efflux from transgenic mouse RBCs was about 55% inhibited by 5 nm charybdotoxin (CTX), a blocker of the calcium activated K+-channel. To compare the fluxes between human and mouse RBCs, we measured the area of mouse RBCs and normalized values to area per liter of cells. The deoxy-simulated CTX-sensitive K+ efflux was larger than the CTX-sensitive K+ efflux observed in RBCs from SS patients. These results suggest that in transgenic mice, deoxygenation increases cytosolic Ca2+ to levels which open Ca2+-activated K+ channels. The presence of these channels was confirmed in both control and transgenic mice by clamping intracellular Ca2+ at 10 microM with the ionophore A23187 and measuring Ca2+-activated K+ efflux. Both types of mouse had similar maximal rates of CTX-sensitive, Ca2+-activated K+ efflux that were similar to those in human SS cells. The capacity of the mouse red cell membrane to regulate cytosolic Ca2+ levels was examined by measurements of the maximal rate of calmodulin activated Ca2+-ATPase activity. This activity was 3-fold greater than that observed in human RBCs thus indicating that mouse RBC membranes have more capacity to regulate cytosolic Ca2+ levels. In summary, transgenic mouse RBCs exhibit larger values of deoxy-stimulated K+ efflux and Na+ influx when compared to human SS cells. They have a similar Ca2+-activated K+ channel activity to human SS cells while expressing a very high Ca2+ pump activity. These properties may contribute to the smaller percent of very dense cells and to the lack of adult anemia in this animal model.

9338089|t|Treadmill chamber for studies of respiratory gas exchange in the rat during exercise.
9338089|a|A treadmill for studying gas exchange in small mammals during exercise is presented. The system consists of a motor-driven running mat enclosed in a gastight chamber that receives a measured flow of air from a compressed air cylinder. The gas flow and temperature, pressure and instantaneous gas composition of the chamber (oxygen, carbon dioxide and water) are measured continuously and the data are computed to include the effects on chamber atmosphere of the rat activity, either running or at rest. The system is completed with a shock delivery grid that stimulates the rat to run. The calculations are based on the changes in the composition of the gas in the chamber (constantly stirred by a small electric fan) induced by the rat instead of relying on the alterations induced in the outflowing gas. The consumption of oxygen, and production of carbon dioxide and water by the rat are computed in real time, giving a very fast response to physiological change induced by exercise. The chamber is custom-made from an aluminium block and a plexiglass lid; all other components are available commercially. The system, as described, allows for a detailed analysis of respiratory gas (and water) exchange by rats under varying exercise conditions, there is practically no time lag between changes in respiratory gases and the detection of these changes, and the buffering effect of the chamber size is practically eliminated because of the calculation approach used.

9334930|t|Puumala virus and two genetic variants of Tula virus are present in Austrian rodents.
9334930|a|Puumala and Tula viruses are hantaviruses found in Europe and are associated with the rodents Clethrionomys glareolus and Microtus arvalis, respectively. Puumala virus is associated with the human disease nephropathia epidemica. In Austria, ten clinically diagnosed cases of nephropathia epidemica, presumably caused by Puumala virus infection, have been reported but not virologically confirmed [Leschinskaya et al., 1991; Aberle et al., 1996]. To identify the hantaviruses that are present in Austria, five species of rodents were trapped and screened for virus antibodies, antigen, and RNA. Hantaviruses were detected in two species, Cl. glareolus and M. arvalis, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR products from Cl. glareolus tissues yielded a unique Puumala virus sequence distinct from Puumala virus sequences reported from other parts of Europe. RT-PCR products from M. arvalis tissues yielded two genetically distinct Tula virus sequences, one similar to sequences reported from Slovakia and the Czech Republic and another that appears to be a novel genetic variant of Tula virus. This is the first confirmed report of hantaviruses in Austria.

9342232|t|Molecular cloning of the gene for mouse leukotriene-C4 synthase.
9342232|a|Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) synthase (LTC4S), an integral membrane protein, catalyzes the conjugation of leukotriene A4 with reduced glutathione to form LTC4, the biosynthetic parent of the additional cysteinyl leukotriene metabolites. An XmnI-digested fragment of a P1 clone from a 129 mouse ES library contained the full-length gene of 2.01 kb for mouse LTC4S. The mouse LTC4S gene is comprised of 5 exons of 122, 100, 71, 82 and 241 nucleotides, with intron sizes that range from 76 nucleotides to 937 nucleotides. The intron/exon boundaries are identical to those of the human genes for LTC4S and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). Primer extension demonstrated a single transcription-initiation site 64 bp 5' of the ATG translation-start site. Nucleotide sequencing of 1.2 kb of the 5' flanking region revealed multiple putative sites for activating protein-2, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and polyoma virus enhancer-3. Fluorescent in situ hybridization mapped the mouse LTC4S gene to mouse chromosome 11, in a region containing the genes for interleukin 13 and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and orthologous to the chromosomal location of 5q35 for the human LTC4S gene. Thus, the mouse LTC4S gene is similar in size, intron/exon organization and chromosomal localization to the human LTC4S gene. Recent mutagenic analysis of the conjugation function of human LTC4S has identified R51 and Y93 as critical for acid and base catalysis of LTA4 and reduced glutathione, respectively. A comparison across species for proteins that possess LTC4S activity reveals conservation of both of these residues, whereas R51 is absent in the FLAP molecules. Thus, within the glutathione S-transferase superfamily of genes, alignment of specific residues allows the separation of LTC4S family members from their most structurally similar counterparts, the FLAP molecules.

9357854|t|Differential induction of c-fos, c-jun, and apoptosis in lung epithelial cells exposed to ROS or RNS.
9357854|a|Reactive oxygen (ROS) or nitrogen (RNS) species can affect epithelial cells to cause acute damage and an array of pulmonary diseases. The goal of this study was to determine patterns of early response gene expression and functional end points of exposure to nitric oxide (NO.), H2O2, or peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in a line of rat lung epithelial (RLE) cells. Our focus was on c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes, as these genes play an important role in proliferation or apoptosis, possible end points of exposure to reactive metabolites in lung. Our data demonstrate that NO. generated by spermine 1,3-propanediamine N-14-[1-(3-aminopropyl)-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazino]-butyl] or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine as well as H2O2 cause increased c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels, nuclear proteins, and complexes binding the activator protein-1 recognition sequence in RLE cells. These agents also lead to apoptosis and increased membrane permeability. In contrast, exogenously administered ONOO- or 3-morpholinosydnonimine do not induce protooncogenes or apoptosis in RLE cells despite nitration oftyrosines. We conclude that ROS and RNS can elicit distinct molecular and phenotypic responses in a target cell of pulmonary disease.

9315494|t|Trazodone, a double blind trial for treatment of erectile dysfunction.
9315494|a|OBJECTIVE: to assess the effectiveness of oral trazodone 150 mg/d for treatment of erectile dysfunction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial. A run-in period of two weeks was followed by four weeks of medication. Evaluation was done by patients diary, a questionnaire and Rigiscan nightly penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR) measurements in the second and sixth week of the trial. RESULTS: 69 patients were randomised, two patients never returned for follow-up, nine patients stopped the medication due to side-effects, so 58 patients are evaluable for effect assessment. Half of the patients suffered psychogenic impotence. There was no significant difference in the subjective results of trazodone compared to placebo. Side effects occurred more often with the use of trazodone, but this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In a group of patients, that was not selected on the basis of the etiology of the erectile dysfunction, nor selected on the duration of the complaint, the efficacy of trazodone 150 mg/d, could not be shown.

9237795|t|Treatment of NOD diabetes with a novel peptide of the hsp60 molecule induces Th2-type antibodies.
9237795|a|A peptide from the sequence of hsp60 molecule, designated p277, has been shown to be functionally involved in modulating the development of auto-immune diabetes in the NOD mouse: administration of p277 to NOD mice can arrest the diabetogenic autoimmune process, even when far advanced. Is p277 the only hsp60 peptide able to modulate the disease? We mapped T cell responses to peptides spanning the mouse hsp60 molecule and identified an immunogenic peptide, designated p12, that is also functional in arresting NOD diabetes. Although no spontaneous T cell reactivity to p12 could be detected in NOD mice, subcutaneous administration of 100 microg of p12 in mineral oil to 10-week-old female NOD mice, similar to treatment with p277, significantly prevented progression of the disease. Administration of other immunogenic peptides was not effective. A peptide from the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) sequence, GADp35, and a peptide from the myco-bacterial hsp60 molecule did not influence the development of diabetes. The effectiveness of hsp60 peptides p12 and p277 was associated with the induction of antibodies to the peptides of the IgG1 and IgG2b isotypes, antibodies which appear to be regulated by anti-inflammatory cytokines. There was a negative correlation between the amounts of antibodies induced by the hsp60 peptides and the level of blood glucose. Thus, more than one peptide of the hsp60 molecule can be used to inhibit the development of NOD diabetes, and the effect of peptide therapy appears to be associated with the induction of specific antibody isotypes.

9354327|t|Activity regulates the synaptic localization of the NMDA receptor in hippocampal neurons.
9354327|a|We describe here a novel effect of activity on the subcellular distribution of NMDA receptors in hippocampal neurons in culture. In spontaneously active neurons, NMDA receptors were clustered at a few synaptic and nonsynaptic sites. Chronic blockade of NMDA receptor activity induced a 380% increase in the number of NMDA receptor clusters and a shift to a more synaptic distribution. This effect was reversible. The distributions of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin, the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluR1, and the putative NMDA receptor clustering protein PSD-95 were not affected by blockade. Regulation of the synaptic localization of NMDA receptors by activity may define a novel mechanism by which input controls a neuron's ability to modify its synapses.

9297573|t|Atypical association of H1 and H2 histamine receptors with signal transduction pathways during multistage mouse skin carcinogenesis.
9297573|a|OBJECTIVE: In the present work we studied the association of histamine receptors with second messengers during multistage carcinogenesis in Sencar mice skin. METHODS: 96 Sencar female mouse, divided into six groups were used. Tumors appeared only in the 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-initiated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-promoted group. Control groups received only TPA, or acetone or no treatment at all. Periodically during the promotion period, cAMP and inositol phosphate production were measured after stimulation with H1 or H2 agonists in samples from all groups. RESULTS: In non-treated skin, H1 receptors were coupled to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and H2 receptors mediated cAMP production. Conversely, in tumors H2 receptors were associated with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and H1 mediated a rise in cAMP levels. The skin among tumors and the skin from all control groups maintained the same coupling as non-treated skin. An increase in mast cell number, with a homogeneous subepithelial distribution and marked phenotypic changes, was also observed in promoted skin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate an atypical association of histamine receptors with second messengers that could be a critical feature for the postulated action of histamine in tumor growth.

9335237|t|Atypical lymphoid infiltrates arising in cutaneous lesions of connective tissue disease.
9335237|a|Atypical lymphoid infiltrates occurring in the setting of connective-tissue disease (CTD) comprise malignant neoplasms of B-cell or T-cell phenotypes and various reactive lymphoid hyperplasias, such as myoepithelial sialadenitis, lymphocytic thyroiditis, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. We describe 17 patients with atypical lymphoid infiltrates arising in cutaneous lesions of CTD, the spectrum of which included lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, relapsing polychondritis, and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. There were two principal categories, pseudolymphoma and malignant lymphoma, the former representing 15 of the 17 cases. The clinical and histologic features and possible pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed.

9321417|t|Synonymous substitution rates in Drosophila: mitochondrial versus nuclear genes.
9321417|a|Synonymous substitution rates in mitochondrial and nuclear genes of Drosophila were compared. To make accurate comparisons, we considered the following: (1) relative synonymous rates, which do not require divergence time estimates, should be used; (2) methods estimating divergence should take into account base composition; (3) only very closely related species should be used to avoid effects of saturation; (4) the heterogeneity of rates should be examined. We modified the methods estimating synonymous substitution numbers to account for base composition bias. By using these methods, we found that mitochondrial genes have 1.7-3.4 times higher synonymous substitution rates than the fastest nuclear genes or 4.5-9.0 times higher rates than the average nuclear genes. The average rate of synonymous transversions was 2.7 (estimated from the melanogaster species subgroup) or 2.9 (estimated from the obscura group) times higher in mitochondrial genes than in nuclear genes. Synonymous transversions in mitochondrial genes occurred at an approximately equivalent rate to those in the fastest nuclear genes. This last result is not consistent with the hypothesis that the difference in turnover rates between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes is the major factor determining higher synonymous substitution rates in mtDNA. We conclude that the difference in synonymous substitution rates is due to a combination of two factors: a higher transitional mutation rate in mtDNA and constraints on nuclear genes due to selection for codon usage.

9378240|t|Vasodilation profile of CD-832, a novel dihydropyridine derivative in rabbit aorta.
9378240|a|1. CD-832, nifedipine and nitrendipine, but not nitroglycerin and nicorandil, inhibited the KCl-induced contraction of rabbit aortas. 2. CD-832, nitroglycerin and nicorandil, but not nifedipine and nitrendipine, inhibited the norepinephrine-induced contraction of aortas. The inhibitory effects of these agents were either potentiated or inhibited by zaprinast or methylene blue, respectively. 3. On the KCl-induced contraction, the duration of CD-832-induced vasodilation was longer than that of nifedipine. Concerning the norepinephrine-induced contraction, the duration of CD-832-induced vasodilation was longer than that of nicorandil. 4. These results suggest that the mechanism of CD-832-induced vasodilation concerns both Ca(2+)-antagonistic action and a nitratelike action. Furthermore, the vasodilation is long lasting.

9356032|t|Evidence of an increased number of type IIb muscle fibers in insulin-resistant first-degree relatives of patients with NIDDM.
9356032|a|Insulin resistance is a common feature in first-degree relatives of NIDDM patients. To explore the mechanism(s) behind this condition in more detail, a percutaneous muscle biopsy (vastus lateralis) was performed in 25 first-degree relatives of NIDDM patients and 21 control subjects to examine muscle fiber composition and capillary density. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (Rd) was determined employing a hyperinsulinemic-(insulin infusion rate 0.6 mU x kg[-1] x min[-1]) euglycemic clamp. Rd (5.76 +/- 0.35 vs. 8.06 +/- 0.36 mg x kg lean body weight [LBW]-1 x min[-], P < 0.001) and estimated VO2max (49.3 +/- 2.8 vs. 57.2 +/- 3.5 mg x kg LBW[-1] x min[-1], 0.05 < P < 0.10) were decreased in the relatives. The number of type IIb fibers (29.5 +/- 2.5 vs. 21.0 +/- 2.8%, P < 0.05) was increased in the relatives, whereas no significant differences were found in other fiber types or capillary density between the groups. Correlations were observed between number of type I fibers (positive), number of type IIb fibers (negative), and capillary density (positive) versus Rd as well as estimated VO2max (P < 0.05). In a multiple linear regression analysis with Rd as a dependent variable, estimated VO2max, family history of NIDDM, and number of type IIb fibers (P < 0.001, r2 = 0.64) significantly determined the level of Rd, whereas capillary density did not. In conclusion, insulin-resistant first-degree relatives of NIDDM patients are characterized by an increased number of type IIb muscle fibers. Whether this finding reflects a reduced physical activity level and fitness in the relatives or is of primary genetic origin remains to be determined.

9379020|t|Transgenic expression of lymphotoxin restores lymph nodes to lymphotoxin-alpha-deficient mice.
9379020|a|Lymphotoxin-alpha (LT alpha) has recently been demonstrated to be important in the development of lymph nodes (LN), Peyer's patches, and splenic organization, including the development of germinal centers. To elucidate the role of LT alpha in lymphoid organogenesis and the plasticity of the process, we examined LT alpha-/- mice in which an LT alpha transgene under the control of the rat insulin promoter (RIPLT) is expressed in the pancreas, kidney, and skin. The LT alpha transgene restored LN in LT alpha-/- mice. The reconstituted LN of RIPLT.LT alpha-/- mice had germinal center-like peanut agglutinin-positive regions, but lacked follicular dendritic cells. Although the LT alpha transgene did not restore Peyer's patches or splenic architecture, it restored the ability of the spleen to form germinal centers and follicular dendritic cell networks. Lymphocytes isolated from the reconstituted LN showed normal proliferative responses to T and B cell mitogens and were defective in their proliferative response to T-dependent Ag, and a decreased number of interdigitating dendritic cells was apparent in the RIPLT.LT alpha-/- mice LN. Expression of the RIPLT transgene in mice deficient in LT beta did not reconstitute LN, suggesting an important role for LT beta in the mechanisms that reconstitute LN in RIPLT.LT alpha-/- mice. These data are the first to demonstrate reconstitution of LN in LT alpha-/- mice and show that the process of LN restoration is amenable to manipulation with ectopic lymphotoxin.

9378367|t|Tempol inhibits neutrophil and hydrogen peroxide-mediated DNA damage.
9378367|a|Inflammatory conditions characterized by neutrophil activation are associated with a variety of chronic diseases. Reactive oxygen species are produced by activated neutrophils and produce DNA damage which may lead to tissue damage. Previous studies have shown that activated murine neutrophils induce DNA strand breaks in a target plasmacytoma cell, RIMPC 2394. We studied the effect of a water soluble nitroxide anti-oxidant, Tempol, on murine neutrophil induction of DNA strand breaks in this system. Murine neutrophils were isolated from the peritoneal cavity of BALB/cAn mice after an i.p. injection of pristane oil. Neutrophils were activated by the phorbol ester PMA and co-incubated with RIMPC 2394 cells. Control alkaline elution studies revealed progressive DNA strand breaks in RIMPC cells with time. The addition of Tempol to the incubation mixture prevented DNA damage in a dose dependent fashion. Five mM Tempol provided complete protection. Tempol protection against DNA strand breaks was similar for both stimulated neutrophils and exogenously added hydrogen peroxide. Measurement of hydrogen peroxide produced by stimulated neutrophils demonstrated that Tempol did not decrease hydrogen peroxide concentration. Oxidation of reduced metals, thereby interfering with the production of hydroxyl radical, is the most likely mechanism of nitroxide protection, although superoxide dismutase (SOD) like activity and scavenging of carbon-based free radicals may also account for a portion of the observed protection. The anti-oxidant activity of Tempol inhibited DNA damage by activated neutrophils. The nitroxides as a class of compounds may have a role in the investigation and modification of inflammatory conditions.

9326899|t|Association between marginal bone loss around osseointegrated mandibular implants and smoking habits: a 10-year follow-up study.
9326899|a|While many factors are conceivable, occlusal loading and plaque-induced inflammation are frequently stated as the most important ones negatively affecting the prognosis of oral implants. Currently, little is known about the relative importance of such factors. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of smoking and other possibly relevant factors on bone loss around mandibular implants. The participants were 45 edentulous patients, 21 smokers and 24 non-smokers, who were followed for 10-year period after treatment with a fixed implant-supported prosthesis in the mandible. The peri-implant bone level was measured on intraoral radiographs, information about smoking habits was based on a careful interview, and oral hygiene was evaluated from clinical registration of plaque accumulation. Besides standard statistical methods, multiple linear regression models were constructed for estimation of the relative influence of some factors on peri-implant bone loss. The long-term results of the implant treatment were good, and only three implants (1%) were lost. The mean marginal bone loss around the mandibular implants was very small, about 1 mm for the entire 10-year period. It was greater in smokers than in non-smokers and correlated to the amount of cigarette consumption. Smokers with poor oral hygiene showed greater marginal bone loss around the mandibular implants than those with good oral hygiene. Oral hygiene did not significantly affect bone loss in non-smokers. Multivariate analyses showed that smoking was the most important factor among those analyzed for association with peri-implant bone loss. The separate models for smokers and non-smokers revealed that oral hygiene had a greater impact on peri-implant bone loss among smokers than among non-smokers. This study showed that smoking was the most important factor affecting the rate of peri-implant bone loss, and that oral hygiene also had an influence, especially in smokers, while other factors, e.g., those associated with occlusal loading, were of minor importance. These results indicate that smoking habits should be included in analyses of implant survival and peri-implant bone loss.

9312211|t|Characterization of a chloride-selective channel from rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes of rat hepatocytes: evidence for a block by phosphate.
9312211|a|We have characterized the conduction and blocking properties of a chloride channel from rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes of rat hepatocytes after incorporation into a planar lipid bilayer. Our experiments revealed the existence of a channel with a mean conductance of 164 +/- 5 pS in symmetrical 200 mm KCl solutions. We determined that the channel was ten times more permeable for Cl- than for K+, calculated from the reversal potential using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. The channel was voltage dependent, with an open probability value ranging from 0.9 at -20 mV to 0.4 at +60 mV. In addition to its fully open state, the channel could also enter a flickering state, which appeared to involve rapid transitions to zero current level. Our results showed a decrease of the channel mean open time combined with an increase of the channel mean closed time at positive potentials. An analysis of the dwell time distributions for the open and closed intervals led to the conclusion that the observed fluctuation pattern was compatible with a kinetic scheme containing a single open state and a minimum of three closed states. The permeability sequence for test halides determined from reversal potentials was Br- > Cl- > I- approximately F-. The voltage dependence of the open probability was modified by the presence of halides in trans with a sequence reflecting the permeability sequence, suggesting that permeant anions such as Br- and Cl- have access to an internal site capable of controlling channel gating. Adding NPPB to the cis chamber inhibited the channel activity by increasing fast flickering and generating long silent periods, whereas channel activity was not affected by 50 microM DNDS in trans. The channel was reversibly inhibited by adding phosphate to the trans chamber. The inhibitory effect of phosphate was voltage-dependent and could be reversed by addition of Cl-. Our results suggest that channel block involves the interaction of HPO2-4 with a site located at 70% of the membrane span.

9342780|t|The effects of kainic acid lesions on dopaminergic responses to haloperidol and clozapine.
9342780|a|The antipsychotic drugs haloperidol and clozapine have the common action of increasing dopamine metabolism in the striatum (nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen) of the rat. Intracerebroventricular administration of kainic acid (KA) produces neuronal loss in limbic-cortical brain regions which project directly or indirectly to the striatum. In the present study, dopamine metabolism in subregions of the striatum was examined in rats with KA lesions after acute and chronic haloperidol or clozapine administration. The main findings was that the elevating effect of acute haloperidol treatment on the dopamine metabolite, DOPAC, was blocked in the nucleus accumbens shell and diminished in medial and laterodorsal caudate-putamen of the KA-lesioned rats. In addition, the elevating effects of both acute and chronic haloperidol treatment on dopamine turnover were attenuated in the laterodorsal caudate-putamen of KA-lesioned rats. The levels of dopamine, DOPAC, and HVA after chronic clozapine treatment were greater in KA-lesioned than control rats. These results indicate that dopaminergic responses to haloperidol may be diminished by limbic-cortical neuropathology, while such pathology does not significantly alter dopaminergic responses to clozapine.

9376257|t|Outcomes study of a course in breast-cancer screening.
9376257|a|BACKGROUND: The Breast Cancer Screening Module is a professional training course within the Professional Education for Prevention and Early Detection (PEPED) program at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. An outcomes study was done to determine the module's ability to improve screening practices crucial to breast-cancer control. METHODS: The five-day course combines 17 hours of class work with 20 hours of hands-on clinical training. Subjects were followed for one year post-training. Six outcome areas were evaluated: 1) knowledge about breast-cancer prevention; 2) clinical skills; 3) changes in routine practice; 4) numbers of patients screened, referred, and diagnosed; 5) trainee satisfaction with the course; and 6) barriers to implementing screening in routine practice. The study population was 63 subjects (all nurse professionals). RESULTS: Outcomes were positive in all six evaluation areas-significant gains in general and clinical knowledge tests (p < or = 0.05); a significant increase from 54.2% pre-training to 70.5% post-training in risk counseling (p < or = 0.05); a sustained increase in screening practices (4.3 times and 2.8 times greater at 6 and 12 months post-training, respectively); 72% rate of high course satisfaction; and barriers to improved screening practices, such as time limitations among 60.4% of subjects and 57.6% of their employers, were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This unique training enhances breast-cancer prevention and screening practices and early detection.

9380972|t|[Immunogenetic study in Mexican couples with recurrent spontaneous abortions]
9380972|a|AIM: To study the HLA markers in Mexican couples who have suffered three or more spontaneous abortions. DESIGN: The study included 24 couples with recurrent abortions and 32 with normal fertility. METHOD: HLA class I (A, B, C) and class II (DR, DQ) typing was done with a standard microlymphocytoxity test. The intergroup differences were evaluated by chi-square and the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: The frequency of the MHC markers in the males and females of couples with abortions were not significantly different from those in fertile couples. However, the abortion couples shared class I antigens more often than expected from random mating as compared to fertile couples, specially in the HLA-B locus. We also found a significantly decreased frequency of the HLA-B7 antigen in males belonging to the abortion group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that HLA-B antigens may be markers for genes related to pregnancy outcome in Mexicans.

9354556|t|Mitral valve repair in a patient with severe porcelain aorta.
9354556|a|We repaired the mitral valve in a patient with severe porcelain aorta. Significant mitral regurgitation developed in a 66-year-old woman with heavy calcification throughout the whole aorta. At operation, cardiopulmonary bypass was properly established by combined axillary and femoral arterial cannulations for sufficient systemic flow. Likewise, the combination of a superior mitral approach and profound hypothermic fibrillatory arrest in conjunction with low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass allowed us to repair the mitral valve successfully.

9335178|t|Overproduction and purification of an agarase of bacterial origin.
9335178|a|The agarase gene from Streptomyces coelicolor has been cloned in the non-producer bacterium Streptomyces lividans under the control of its own set of promoters and under the control of a heterologous promoter that is functional only during exponential growth. The best level of overproduction was obtained when the strain containing the natural gene was cultivated in fed batch with mannitol as carbon source. The protein, with a relative molecular mass of 32 kDa, has been purified following an affinity purification method. Contaminating activities seem to be absent from the purified enzyme preparation that can be used to purify DNA from agarose gels.

9271786|t|Oxidative stress and the mobilisation of arachidonic acid in stimulated human platelets: role of hydroxyl radical.
9271786|a|Platelet functions, including eicosanoid biosynthesis, can be significantly altered by exposure to reactive oxygen species. We utilised the redox properties of the phenazine derivative, pyocyanin, to generate low micromolar levels of reactive oxygen species in order to investigate the metabolism of arachidonic acid by human platelets under oxidative stress. Eicosanoid production by platelets, pre-labelled with [3H]arachidonic acid (AA) and stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187, was inhibited in the presence of pyocyanin. In contrast, platelets pre-treated with pyocyanin and concurrently exposed to A23187 and AA showed no evidence of inhibition. Analysis of the free label content of labelled, pyocyanin-treated platelets after stimulation revealed diminished levels of total free label and a corresponding increase in labelled phospholipid. Prior treatment with the antioxidants, superoxide dismutase, catalase or the hydroxyl radical scavenger, mannitol, before the addition of pyocyanin afforded protection against loss of eicosanoid production and restored AA release. We conclude that hydroxyl radicals inhibit one or more steps in the cascade leading to phospholipase A2 activation and release of arachidonic acid from platelet phospholipid stores.

9329890|t|Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema in leukemic patients: a report of 15 cases.
9329890|a|BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema is a distinct localized cutaneous response to certain systemic chemotherapeutic agents. METHODS: Between January 1990 and December 1994, from a total of 76 leukemic patients who have received combination chemotherapy consisting of cytosine arabinoside and anthracycline antibiotics, 15 patients developed chemotherapy-induced acral erythema. Fourteen of the patients had acute myelocytic leukemia, and one of them had chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase. Clinical features of these 15 patients have been analysed. Biopsy specimens obtained from eight of the patients were also evaluated for histopathologic alterations. RESULTS: The overall incidence of this reaction was found to be 19.7% in our group of patients receiving this chemotherapy protocol. The onset of reaction varied from the fourth to the seventeenth days of the chemotherapy and resolved within 2 weeks in most of the patients. Lesions appeared as well-defined erythema and edema involving the palmar surfaces in all of the patients. In nine of the patients the reaction recurred with subsequent chemotherapies. Scattered necrotic keratinocytes, vacuolar alterations of the basal layer, and mild to moderate perivascular lymphocytic infiltration in the dermis were the histopathologic findings observed in the biopsy specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema is a frequent reaction in patients who are receiving high-dose chemotherapy. For patients in whom this self-limited condition develops, reassurance is the mainstay of therapy. Awareness of this reaction is also important to be able to differentiate it from acute graft versus host disease in patients who receive bone marrow transplants.

9378393|t|Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for severe Clostridium difficile colitis.
9378393|a|BACKGROUND: Many individuals have serum antibodies against Clostridium difficile toxins. Those with an impaired antitoxin response may be susceptible to recurrent, prolonged, or severe C difficile diarrhoea and colitis. AIMS: To examine whether treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin might be effective in patients with severe pseudomembranous colitis unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy. PATIENTS: Two patients with pseudomembranous colitis not responding to metronidazole and vancomycin were given normal pooled human immunoglobulin intravenously (200-300 mg/kg). METHODS: Antibodies against C difficile toxins were measured in nine immunoglobulin preparations by ELISA and by cytotoxin neutralisation assay. RESULTS: Both patients responded quickly as shown by resolution of diarrhoea, abdominal tenderness, and distension. All immunoglobulin preparations tested contained IgG against C difficile toxins A and B by ELISA and neutralised the cytotoxic activity of C difficile toxins in vitro at IgG concentrations of 0.4-1.6 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: Passive immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulin may be a useful addition to antibiotic therapy for severe, refractory C difficile colitis. IgG antitoxin is present in standard immunoglobulin preparations and C difficile toxin neutralising activity is evident at IgG concentrations which are readily achieved in the serum by intravenous immunoglobulin administration.

9380284|t|[Precision of drug dilution techniques]
9380284|a|OBJECT: Evaluation of accuracy of three common dilution methods for drugs. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN: Perspective double blind investigation from March to June 1995. PLACE: Anaesthesia and Resuscitation Service of Children's Hospital of Iglesias (CA). METHODS: Forty dopamine at 2/1000 samples, obtained by dilution of dopamine at 40/1000 on sale with three different methods by five different operators, were analysed with a chromatography system in liquid phase at high pressure. RESULTS: Mean concentration with difference not exceeding 5% from the goal, are considered acceptable. Only one group of samples was found to be into these limits, but it was also the most dangerous for the high percentage of great mistakes in dilution. Although there are significant differences in the accuracy and safety of the three dilution methods, the highest and lowest final concentrations obtained differ very much from those estimated. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that drugs confections with proper dilution for different clinical uses might be on sale.

9322874|t|Retroviral mediated gene transfer of the Fanconi anemia complementation group C gene to hematopoietic progenitors of group C patients.
9322874|a|Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progress pancytopenia, congenial abnormalities, and a predisposition to malignancy. Therapy is currently limited to allogeneic marrow transplantation; patients lacking a suitable donor usually die from aplasia or acute leukemia. Recently, mutation in a novel gene named FACC (Fanconi anemia C-complementing) has been identified as causing one type of FA. FACC mutations, which introduce splicing errors or stop codons, have been identified in approximately 15% of FA patients. We have recently been successful in functional complementation of four FA cell lines using retroviral vectors to transfer a copy of the normal FACC gene. We also analyzed the ability of our viral vectors to functionally correct hematopoietic progenitor cells from a patient bearing a splice donor mutation. As for the lymphoid cell lines, these CD34-enriched cells were extremely sensitive to MMC. After infection of these progenitor cells with viral vectors bearing normal FACC, the progenitors gave rise to increased numbers of colonies both in the absence and presence of up to 5nM MMC, whereas control cells were completely destroyed by 1nM MMC. In summary, we have demonstrated that: (1) retroviral vectors can be engineered to transfer a normal FACC gene to FA(C) lymphoid cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells; (2) introduction of a normal FACC gene into CD34+ progenitors markedly enhances their growth in the absence and presence of MMC. This study is designed to determine whether hematopoietic progenitors transduced with the normal FACC gene can be reinfused safely into FA(C) patients. CD34+ cells obtained from G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood will be transduced ex vivo over a 72-hour period in the presence of IL-3, IL-6, and Stem Cell Factor with the FACC retroviral vector. These transduced cells will be reinfused into FA(C) patients. Patients will be monitored for toxicities as well as evidence of successful gene transfer and expression. The procedure will be repeated up to a total of 4 times with each treatment 2-4 months apart. Theoretically, these rescued stem cells should have a selective growth advantage within the hypoplastic FA marrow environment in vivo.

9350014|t|Serum CA-125 measurements > 65 U/mL. Clinical value.
9350014|a|OBJECTIVE: To review the prevalence of various conditions associated with serum CA-125 values > 65 U/mL, to calculate the odds ratios of different ranges of high CA-125 in predicting cancer and to study the effect of menopause and the presence of a mass on the predictive value of high serum CA-125. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of the diagnoses in 313 consecutive women seen at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation whose serum CA-125 was > 65 U/mL was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using crosstabulation, chi 2, Fisher's exact test and the odds ratio. RESULTS: In patients with serum CA-125 > 65 U/mL, gynecologic cancers, nongynecologic cancers and non-malignant conditions constituted 74.3%, 10.2% and 13.1% of diagnoses, respectively. In patients with serum CA-125 > or = 1,000 U/mL, the same conditions were responsible for 89%, 7% and 3% of diagnoses, respectively. Endometriosis and metastatic breast cancer were the most common benign condition and nongynecologic cancer associated with serum CA-125 > 65 U/mL. The presence of an abdominopelvic mass significantly increased the risk of malignancy (P < .00005). Approximately 90% of patients with CA-125 > 65 U/mL and no mass had nonmalignant disease. The diagnoses of serum CA-125 values > 65 U/mL varied significantly in premenopausal versus postmenopausal patients. Postmenopausal patients had a higher incidence of gynecologic (P = .002) and nongynecologic (P = .0008) cancers and lower incidence of benign conditions (P < .0005). The odds ratio that CA-125 levels were associated with cancer increased as the level of CA-125 increased. The odds ratio of malignant versus benign disease was significantly higher in post-menopausal patients for all intervals of CA-125 levels until the level of > or = 1,000 U/mL was reached. CONCLUSION: In patients seen at a tertiary center, serum CA-125 measurements > 65 U/mL were associated with nonmalignant conditions in 13% of patients. Although higher serum CA-125 levels were more associated with gynecologic malignancies, no level of CA-125 occurred exclusively with gynecologic cancers. In postmenopausal patients with serum CA-125 values > 65 U/mL and in patients with serum CA-125 values > 65 U/mL and an abdominopelvic mass, subspecialty consultation should be considered before proceeding to surgery.

9306294|t|Physiological and behavioral responses to minor stressors in offspring of patients with panic disorder.
9306294|a|Nineteen children born to patients with panic disorder and a comparison group of 16 children born to unaffected, non-psychiatric patient subjects exposed to novel and mildly stressful situations (visiting an unfamiliar place and watching a movie containing anxiogenic scenes) were assessed for their behaviors, heart rate, respiratory rate and salivary cortisol secretion. At arrival children born to patients with panic disorder had significantly longer latency of first spontaneous verbal comment, fewer prosocial behavior, and increased distress and attachment behavior. During the projection of the movie, children of the two groups differed for attachment, distress, and exploration behaviors. During the anxiogenic scenes children born to patients with panic disorder showed increased behavioral inhibition and higher heart rate. Autonomic modulation, respiratory rates and cortisol secretion were similar in the two groups. Some distinct psychophysiological patterns may constitute early manifestations of the transmitted liability to panic disorder.

9305762|t|Rice lipid transfer protein (LTP) genes belong to a complex multigene family and are differentially regulated.
9305762|a|Several cDNA clones encoding three different lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) have been isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) in order to analyse the complexity, the evolution and the expression of the LTP gene family. The mature proteins deduced from three clones exhibited a molecular mass of 9 kDa, in agreement with the molecular mass of other LTPs from plants. The clones were shown to be homologous in the coding region, while the 3' non-coding regions diverged strongly between the clones. The occurrence of at least three small multigene families encoding these proteins in rice was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. When compared with each other and with LTPs from other plants, the cluster including rice LTPs and other cereal LTPs indicated that these genes duplicated rather recently and independently in the different plant phyla. The expression pattern of each gene family was also investigated. Northern blot experiments demonstrated that they are differentially regulated in the different tissues analysed. Components such as salt, salicylic acid and abscisic acid were shown to modulate Ltp gene expression, depending on tissues and gene classes, suggesting a complex regulation of these genes.

9382350|t|[Risk factors in retinopathy of prematurity]
9382350|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the potential risk factors in acute retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of preterm infants with birth weights less than 1,501 g, or more if mechanical ventilation and oxygen administration were needed, was carried out. Indirect ophthalmoscopy (mydriasis) with indentation was done every 15 days from the fourth week. Fifteen factors were analyzed. Statistically significant differences between the groups with and without ROP were sought with Fisher's exact probability test, two-sample t-test, and the chi-square contingency-table. A logistic regression was done. RESULTS: Thirty-six of the 137 infants examined (26.2%) with birth weight < or = 1,500 g had acute ROP. Only 7.1% of the infants with birth weights > or = 1,501 g had retinopathy. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the following variables: birth weight, gestational age, blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, FiO2 (fraction inspired oxygen) maximum, time of FiO2 > or = 0.60 (hours) and time of FiO2 > or = 0.21 (days). However, the birth-weight was the only independent risk factor related to ROP. CONCLUSIONS: Retinopathy of the premature has a multifactorial etiology. The low gestational age and the oxygen had influence on ROP; however, low birth weight was the independent risk factor.

9376273|t|Primary systemic therapy for operable breast cancer--10-year survival data after chemotherapy and hormone therapy.
9376273|a|Between 1984 and 1990, 94 women presenting to the Edinburgh Breast Unit with operable breast cancer of 4 cm or greater in diameter (T2, T3, N0, N1, M0) were given preoperative systemic therapy. Initially, all women received hormone therapy, with CHOP (cyclophosphamide 1 g m(-2), doxorubicin 50 mg m(-2), vincristine 1.4 mg m(-2) to a maximum of 2 mg and prednisolone 40 mg per day orally for 5 days) chemotherapy being administered to those who failed to respond by 3 months. After April 1987, first-line hormone therapy was only offered to women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-moderate/-rich (> 20 fmol mg(-1) protein) tumours, and CHOP was reserved for those women whose tumours failed to respond to hormone therapy and for those with ER-negative/-poor tumours. Response data have been published previously (Anderson et al, 1991). After a median follow-up of 7.5 years, there is no difference in survival between those women given initial hormone therapy and those given chemotherapy, with neither group having yet reached its median survival. The two key factors that predicted for a poor survival were the number of involved axillary nodes after preoperative systemic therapy (P < 0.00001) and a lack of response to preoperative therapy (P < 0.05). These data suggest that many women with ER-moderate/-rich tumours will have a good prognosis after preoperative hormone therapy alone. However, it is possible to identify, by their post-systemic therapy axillary node status, a group of women who still have an appalling prognosis after preoperative chemotherapy or hormone therapy.

These infections develop most frequently in the setting of advanced immunosuppression. There is no part of the neuraxis that is immune to these complications and the concurrence of more than one infectious illness may always be considered. The neuroimaging features, when coupled with the clinical and laboratory findings, often suggest the correct diagnosis and enable the physician to initiate therapy.

9332524|a|Renal disease in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often presents with significant proteinuria and progressive renal failure; focal glomerulosclerosis is the most common renal pathology identified. To our knowledge, we report the first case of nephrotic-range proteinuria and preserved renal function in an HIV-infected patient in association with disseminated histoplasmosis. The initial level of proteinuria was 12.5 g/24 h. The patient developed a concomitant lesion on his neck, which was biopsied and identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by fungal stains and culture. The serum CF titer of antibody against yeast antigens of H. capsulatum was 1:8. The level of serum albumin decreased to 2.0 g/dL, and the level of serum cholesterol increased to 284 mg/dL. Immunohistochemical staining of renal biopsy tissue demonstrated immune complexes within the mesangium; H. capsulatum antigen was also demonstrated in the mesangium. Therapy with oral itraconazole resulted in marked clinical improvement. The findings in this case emphasize the need to rule out treatable causes of the nephrotic syndrome in AIDS, especially in cases of immune-complex glomerulonephritis.

9341963|t|Current strategies for pain control.
9341963|a|Pain is the most feared symptom for patients diagnosed with cancer. Although our understanding of cancer pain and its management has greatly improved in the past decade, an unacceptably large proportion of patients still do not receive adequate pain relief. Before commencing any form of treatment, patients must receive a thorough assessment in order to define the pain, causes and severity. The recommendations for progressing a patient from step 2 to step 3 of the WHO analgesic ladder are discussed here as well as the choice of strong opioid substitution. An overview of the benefits of considering alternative routes of administering strong opioids, such as the transdermal delivery of fentanyl (TTS fentanyl), and the use of opioid substitution in patients intolerant to the adverse effects of morphine are also included. Finally, newer approaches to relieving refractory pain, such as neuropathic and bone pain, are considered.

9323036|t|Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a human gelatinase B-inhibitory single-chain immunoglobulin variable fragment (scFv).
9323036|a|The murine monoclonal antibody REGA-3G12 selectively and specifically inhibits the activity of human gelatinase B. The cDNA fragments which encode the variable regions of the light and heavy chains were isolated by PCR-mediated cloning and sequenced. Single-chain Fv expression constructs for Escherichia coli were generated in which c-myc tag sequences were encoded. Inducible expression of the scFv and secretion to the periplasm were obtained with higher yields when the c-myc tag sequence was positioned at the amino-terminal side. The inhibitory activity of purified scFv on neutrophil gelatinase B was tested in a gelatin degradation assay and it was found to possess a similar specific activity as that of the intact monoclonal antibody and of the pepsin-clipped F(ab')2 derivative. This shows for the first time that inhibition of soluble enzymes with scFv is possible and opens new perspectives for the treatment of diseases with excessive and detrimental enzyme production in the host.

9337362|t|Emergency extracorporeal life support for patients with near-fatal status asthmaticus.
9337362|a|Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was used to treat three patients with near-fatal status asthmaticus who did not respond to aggressive medical therapies and mechanical ventilation under controlled permissive hypercapnia. ECLS was instituted in patient 1 because PaCO2 was excessively high and pH was excessively low, in patient 2 because hypoxemia and shock were not responsive to treatment, and in patient 3 because of sustained severe hypotension. ECLS supported adequate gas exchange until pulmonary function improved, diminishing the need for mechanical ventilation and preventing pulmonary complications. Pulmonary dysfunction improved markedly after only 21 to 86 hours of ECLS. Aggressive medical treatments were continued during ECLS. Our findings indicate that ECLS is a useful method for preventing death in patients with near-fatal status asthmaticus.

9323783|t|The prevalence of beta-haemolytic streptococci in throat specimens from healthy children and adults. Implications for the clinical value of throat cultures.
9323783|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of age and season of the year on the carrier rate of beta-haemolytic streptococci (BHS) in healthy individuals and patients with throat pain. DESIGN: The prevalence of BHS in throat specimens from healthy individuals was compared with that from patients with throat pain of the same age in a defined geographical area, collected during the same mid-winter and late summer periods. RESULTS: The prevalence of BHS in healthy individuals was low before the age of 3 years (1.9-7.1%) and in adults > or = 16 years (2.4-3.7%) and highest in the age group 3-15 years (5.0-21.2%). The difference in prevalence of BHS between healthy individuals and patients with throat pain was small during the late summer season and large during the mid-winter season. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of BHS varies with age and season in healthy individuals and patients with throat pain. During the summer, it is much more difficult to interpret the result of a throat culture in individuals aged < 16 years.

9344868|t|High pressure modulation of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase activity.
9344868|a|Elevated pressures greater than 551 bar were found to inhibit the DNA supercoiling activity of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase. A large fraction of the inhibitory effect could be reproduced by preincubation of the enzyme at high pressure prior to enzymatic assay at 1 bar. It is proposed that elevated pressure influences gyrase structure, most likely by promoting the dissociation of its subunits, however, it is also possible that effects on enzyme activity exist.

9323782|t|Enterobius vermicularis and finger sucking in young Swedish children.
9323782|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of Enterobius vermicularis and its association with finger sucking in young Swedish children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey with a questionnaire for symptoms of infestation with Enterobius vermicularis, and the children's habit of finger sucking (including fingernail biting). Perianal tape-test for identification of eggs of Enterobius vermicularis. SETTING: Primary care, day-care centres, and schools in a Swedish middle-sized town (approx. 80,000 inhabitants). PARTICIPANTS: 172 children of both sexes, 4-10 years old. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prevalence of Enterobius vermicularis and its association with finger sucking. RESULTS: 21% of the children were symptom-free carriers of Enterobius vermicularis, and finger sucking was strongly associated with a positive tape-test (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: More children than previously known seemed to be symptom-free carriers of Enterobius vermicularis. Finger sucking should be considered when treating infested children and especially those with relapsing symptoms.

9327226|a|Radiation therapy is an important modality in the curative and palliative management of patients with gynecologic malignancies. However, the specific roles of radiation therapy continue to evolve in terms of specific indications, volumes treated, techniques, and integration with other modalities. Retrospective assessments of outcome and prospective clinical trials are necessary to answer questions, generate additional hypotheses, and guide further refinements in the application of radiation therapy.

9344556|t|GABA and glutamate levels in the substantia nigra reticulata following repetitive cerebral ischemia in gerbils.
9344556|a|Repetitive cerebral ischemia produces more severe damage than a similar single duration insult. We have previously shown that, in gerbils, damage in the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) is seen with repetitive insults rather than a single insult. We have also shown that there is a progressive decrease in the extracellular GABA in the striatum in the days preceding such damage, speculating that a loss of GABA may be in part responsible for this damage. This study evaluates the GABA levels in the SNr in animals exposed to repetitive ischemic insults. Each animal received a total of three ischemic insults of 3-min duration at hourly intervals. In vivo microdialysis was carried out to analyze the GABA and glutamate dialysate levels on Days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 following the ischemic insult. In the control and treated (ischemic) animals, there was a significant increase in the GABA levels with the introduction of nipecotic acid on Days 1, 3, 5, and 14. However, on Day 7 there was a significant attenuation in the GABA response to nipecotic acid in the treated animals in comparison to the controls. The glutamate levels in the treated animals were similar to the control animals on Days 1, 3, 5, and 7. However, on Day 14 the glutamate levels were significantly lower than on previous days. Our experiments for the first time measure extracellular glutamate and GABA responses in the SNr in animals exposed to repetitive ischemic insults. Our experiments show that there is a significant decrease in the GABA concentrations at a time when ischemic damage is developing in this region. This confirms our hypothesis that a decrease in GABA may be one factor contributing to neuronal damage during the period following repetitive ischemic insults. Further, the rebound increase in GABA levels on Day 14 with a concomitant fall in glutamate levels would indicate that reparative processes are still active in the 2 weeks following the insult.

9327635|a|This study addresses the chemical and toxicological questions due to the wide use of chemical treatment programmes for industrial cooling water. First, natural problems encountered in cooling tower systems were presented and grouped into three categories: (i) scaling; (ii) corrosion and (iii) biofouling. Chemical solutions adopted in industrial plants were outlined for each one in order to minimize damage and categorized as shut-down, production loss, heat transfer reduction, upsets, etc. Above all, the purpose of the work was to identify the most dangerous chemicals normally used, which means sources of chemical risk for safety workers and their environment; thus, symptoms of exposure, prevention measures and protection tools are also described.

9345269|t|Comparison of exocytotic mechanisms between acetylcholine- and catecholamine-containing vesicles in rat pheochromocytoma cells.
9345269|a|The molecular mechanisms of exocytosis from two types of secretory organelles, synaptic-like microvesicles and secretory vesicles, were compared by measuring acetylcholine (ACh) and catecholamine (CA) release from a newly isolated PC12 subclone, PC12-C3 which contains a high level of Ach. Digitonin-permeabilized PC12-C3 cells released both transmitters with similar Ca(2+)-dependency. Ca(2+)-evoked Ach and CA release from permeabilized cells were increased in the presence of MgATP, suggesting the existence of a MgATP-dependent priming step prior to the Ca(2+)-triggered fusion step in both ACh release and CA release. The non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), produced both ACh and CA release from permeabilized cells in the absence of Ca2+. Pretreatment with a phorbol ester which activates protein kinase C, potentiated depolarization-induced ACh and CA release from unpermeabilized cells. These results indicated that exocytosis from two distinct vesicle populations are mediated by the same basic molecular mechanisms.

9297786|t|Species-specific alteration of hepatic glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity with coplanar polychlorinated biphenyl: evidence for an Ah-receptor-linked mechanism.
9297786|a|We examined the in vivo effect of a highly toxic coplanar polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) on the hepatic activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in aryl hydrocarbon (Ah)-responsive (C57/BL) and -less-responsive (DBA) strains of mice. The activity in the C57BL strain was moderately increased by 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) in a dose dependent manner. However, this was not observed in DBA mice although greater doses were injected. 2,2',5,5'-Tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 52) with a non-planar structure did not increase G6PDH activity. The increase in G6PDH activity with PCB 126 was also seen in rats, but not in guinea pigs. The activity in the latter species was decreased rather than increased. These results suggest that the induction of hepatic G6PDH by coplanar PCB is mediated by a mechanism involving the Ah receptor, and the response was highly species-specific.

9380946|t|[The maternal-fetal immune relationship in pregnancy]
9380946|a|The mother establishes with the fetus a special interaction in pregnancy allowing his normal survival in spite of the different HLA antigens. The main factors contributing to these favourable conditions for the fetus are an efficient local immunosuppression and the formation of a protective barrier between the mother and the fetus. A number of substances are responsible for the local immunosuppression and include cytokines, prostaglandins, hormones as well as various other proteins of pregnancy. In addition, cytokines produced by TH2 lymphocytes seem to be predominant with respect to those of TH1 cells. An effective protection is provided by the trophoblast layer, which not only forms a physical barrier between the mother and the fetus but evades the immune attack of the mother by expressing inhibitory molecules of the complement system and by down regulating the expression of HLA antigens. Data obtained from murine models and clinical observation in pathological pregnancies suggest that an abnormal immune response of the mother against the feto-placental unit may be responsible for the occurrence of recurrent spontaneous abortions. This is proved by the ability of the partner's lymphocytes administered to females in the mouse model prior to mating to reduce the incidence of abortions. Unfortunately, similar treatment in women with recurrent abortion does not appear to be very effective.

9323766|t|Repair of pseudoaneurysms via ultrasound-guided compression.
9323766|a|Pseudoaneurysm formation is one of the potential complications of arterial catheterization. In the past, surgery was the usual method of treatment for pseudoaneurysms. Although surgical repair is still indicated in some cases, a noninvasive procedure called ultrasound-guided compression repair (UGCR) often can be used instead of surgery. During UGCR, an ultrasound transducer is used to apply compression to the pseudoaneurysm, causing a clot to form. This article describes the UGCR procedure and discusses results that clinicians have attained using this method of pseudoaneurysm repair.

9300992|t|Comparison of B-mode, M-mode and echo-tracking methods for measurement of the arterial distension waveform.
9300992|a|Measurements of arterial diameter throughout the cardiac cycle (i.e., the arterial distension waveform) are conducted increasingly to study mechanical properties of the arterial wall and changes associated with disease. The distension waveform of peripheral arteries can be measured noninvasively via ultrasonic echo tracking. M-mode imaging, and B-mode imaging. Of these, echo tracking is the most popular method because of its single micrometer resolution during continuous measurements under ideal conditions. However, high resolution within continuous measurements does not imply high reproducibility between measurements. Therefore, we compared repeated measurements of the amplitude of common carotid artery distension in 26 subjects, obtained sequentially in random order by: 1. Off-line echo tracking of digitized radiofrequency ultrasound; 2. M-mode imaging with automated edge detection; and 3. 30-Hz B-mode imaging with automated edge detection and model-based diameter estimation. In each case, the transducer was hand-held and was removed from the neck between repeated measurements. The amplitude of arterial distension was estimated from the serial diameter measurements by maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, by least-squares fit of a Fourier series model, and by application of a cubic smoothing spline. Within continuous measurements, the standard deviation of the ML distension amplitude for neighboring cardiac cycles was significantly smaller (p > 0.05) with echo-tracking (0.023 mm) than with the B-mode (0.036 mm) or M-mode (0.074 mm) methods. However, between discontinuous measurements on the same subject, the standard deviation of the ML distension amplitude was similar for the echo-tracking (0.076 mm) and B-mode (0.073 mm) methods. The Fourier series model and the cubic smoothing spline slightly reduced the standard deviation of the B-mode and M-mode distension amplitudes, but also reduced the mean amplitude estimate. On the basis of this relative comparison of methods, we conclude that, although echo tracking offers high resolution for continuous measurements, the reproducibility of discontinuous measurements of carotid artery distension is no better with echo tracking than can be obtained from 30-Hz B-mode images.

9335407|t|Hemodynamic responses to endothelin-1 and endothelin antagonists microinjected into the nucleus tractus solitarius in rats.
9335407|a|The role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) within the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in central cardiovascular control was investigated by local microinjections of ET-1 and ET-receptor antagonists. In urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, a unilateral microinjection of ET-1 (1.0, 3.3, and 10.0 pmol) into the NTS significantly increased arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and dP/dt(max) in a dose-dependent manner, and slightly decreased heart rate in a dose-independent manner. The pressor effect lasted >90 min. In normotensive rats, neither PD147953, a selective ETA-receptor antagonist, nor PD142893, a mixed ETA- and ETB-receptor antagonist, microinjected into the NTS elicited any changes in arterial pressure or heart rate. The pressor and bradycardic effects evoked by microinjection of ET-1 into the NTS could be blocked by local pretreatment with PD147953 and completely eliminated by intravenous pretreatment with the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium. The arterial baroreflex sensitivity was almost totally suppressed by microinjection of ET-1 (3.3 pmol) in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. A similar pattern of changes in the hemodynamic variables was elicited by microinjection of ET-1 (3.3 pmol) into the NTS in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In SHRs, microinjection of PD142893 did not elicit any changes in arterial pressure or heart rate. These results suggest that ET-1 modulates reflex control of hemodynamics by activation of autonomic nerve via ETA receptors in the NTS, and that the responsiveness of SHRs to ET-1 or PD142893 is similar to that of WKY rats.

9378510|t|Effect of carbon tetrachloride on rat liver, following parathyroidectomy: histopathological observations.
9378510|a|Absence of centrilobular necrosis, cirrhosis and giant hepatic cells with a large nucleus were significant observations in the liver of CCl4 treated rats following unilateral parathyroidectomy. Increased number of mitochondria and presence of binucleated cells indicated hepatic regeneration in unilaterally parathyroidectomized and CCl4 treated rats. Focal necrosis, giant cells and presence of smooth endoplasmic reticulum around the nucleus reflect a slight impairment in regeneration of the liver following bilateral parathyroidectomy and CCl4 administration. The results show that parathyroidectomy interferes in the pathogenesis of necrosis and associated lesions in the liver of CCl4 treated rats. Overall results indicate that unilateral parathyroidectomy afforded better protection than bilateral parathyroidectomy.

9335288|t|Three genes of a motility operon and their role in flagellar rotary speed variation in Rhizobium meliloti.
9335288|a|The peritrichous flagella of Rhizobium meliloti rotate only clockwise and control directional changes of swimming cells by modulating flagellar rotary speed. Using Tn5 insertions, we have identified and sequenced a motility (mot) operon containing three genes, motB, motC, and motD, that are translationally coupled. The motB gene (and an unlinked motA) has been assigned by similarity to the Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis homologs, whereas motC and motD are new and without known precedents in other bacteria. In-frame deletions introduced in motB, motC, or motD each result in paralysis. MotD function was fully restored by complementation with the wild-type motD gene. By contrast, deletions in motB or motC required the native combination of motB and motC in trans for restoring normal flagellar rotation, whereas complementation with motB or motC alone led to uncoordinated (jiggly) swimming. Similarly, a motB-motC gene fusion and a Tn5 insertion intervening between motB and motC resulted in jiggly swimming as a consequence of large fluctuations in flagellar rotary speed. We conclude that MotC biosynthesis requires coordinate expression of motB and motC and balanced amounts of the two gene products. The MotC polypeptide contains an N-terminal signal sequence for export, and Western blots have confirmed its location in the periplasm of the R. meliloti cell. A working model suggests that interactions between MotB and MotC at the periplasmic surface of the motor control the energy flux or the energy coupling that drives flagellar rotation.

9350135|a|A biotin-labelling in situ hybridization technique was first used to physically map two single copy genes, cdc2 and prh1, in maize. These two genes are metabolically interrelated genes. The full-length cDNA clones cdc2ZmA and ZmPPI of genes cdc2 and prh1 were adopted as the probes. They are 1.3 and 1.6 kb in size, respectively. Clone cdc2ZmA was physically mapped on the long arm of chromosomes 4, 8, and 9. The percent distances from centromere to detection site were 57.9 +/- 2.7, 28.4 +/- 1.5, and 88.2 +/- 3.3. The detection rate was 19.2%. Clone ZmPPI was physically mapped on the long arm of chromosomes 4, 6, and 8. The percent distances were 53.6 +/- 1.2, 60.8 +/- 2.9 and 17.1 +/- 1.6. The detection ratio was 18.5%. The technique of chromosome ISH and the relationship between the location and function of these two genes have been discussed.

9347706|t|Reflections on death and dying.
9347706|a|Americans simultaneously worry about dying and about being tethered to machines that keep them alive beyond a point when life has any meaning. People living with terminal illness often feel isolated from life around them and a burden on those they love; they feel uncertain that their deaths will be relatively free of pain and suffering and that their dignity will be compromised as little as possible. These failings can be remedied. Traditional hospice care and integrating palliative care into the general medical setting are important, but they cannot alone occasion a better dying. The medical community must re-imagine dying and reflect about ways to transform image into reality in practice and in training colleagues and successors. Physicians and others know how to provide care and even improve living when cure is unlikely; the harder task is to respect such care as profoundly as curing. The exigencies of modern medicine, where time is a budgetable commodity, makes caring well for dying patients difficult. Medicine cannot have hegemony over dying and cannot singularly offer people a better death, but it cannot absent itself either. The almost single-minded focus on decision making that has infused conversations about dying and death may divert attention from the attentiveness and loving relationships that are as vital as life's end as at its beginning. Medicine has "colonized" death: It has transformed it into a place where progress in staving it off may appear to be unlimited, and thus it encourages forgetting that death is part of the human condition. The task before medicine, and academic medicine in particular, is to transform death back into a human scale. With all that is available to delay death--but not to make it optional--the most important task is to recover humbleness before an awesome moment and be with the patient, one human being to another, knowing that dying is not always open to solutions.

9376763|a|Radioligand assay showed that the cholinesterase (ChE) reactivators dipiroxime and benzyxime, but not carboxime, modulate selective absorption of some cholinolytics (tributam, pediphen, aprophen) in rat brain. Significant suppression of the specific binding of muscarine antagonists was recorded after chlorophos (2.LD50) intoxication. Under such conditions, the ChE reactivators induce increase in the number of binding sites and in the parameters of the constant of cholinolytic absorption on the brain membranes. It was also established by equilibrium dialysis that the binding of cholinolytics in blood plasma under the effect of ChE reactivators is reduced, leading to redistribution of their free and bound fractures, which is most favorable for tissue sorption.

9263063|t|Use of a raw meat-based diet or a dry kibble diet for sand cats (Felis margarita).
9263063|a|Limited information is available on the utilization of different types of diets by captive exotic felid species. Utilization of diets by small exotic felids may differ depending on the diet fed. Eight sand cats (Felis margarita), which are small, 2- to 4-kg cats, were used to examine the digestibility of two types of diets: a raw meat-based diet and a dry kibble diet. Dry matter, crude protein and energy intakes and digestibilities were evaluated. Digestibilities for dry matter, energy, and crude protein were 83.5 +/- 4.8, 89.6 +/- 5.2, 92.4 +/- 5.3% for the raw meat-based diet and 72.7 +/- 12.3, 76.8 +/- 14.5, and 77.9 +/- 13.5% for the kibble diet. Physiological variables also were examined and included plasma taurine, vitamin A, retinyl palmitate, beta-carotene, calcium, and phosphorus. Plasma taurine means were 91.4 +/- 8.4 mumol/L in cats consuming the raw meat-based diet and 248.0 +/- 23.2 mumol/L in cats consuming the kibble diet. Plasma phosphorus was 5.2 +/- .1 and 4.5 +/- .1 mg/dL, respectively, in cats consuming raw meat-based and kibble diets. beta-Carotene was 25.2 +/- 2.9 and 2.9 +/- .3 micrograms/dL, respectively, for cats consuming the raw meat-based and kibble diets. These results indicate that diets formulated for small captive exotic felid species should be evaluated with respect to diet type and nutrient utilization.

9311427|t|Clinical interpretation of "In-hand manipulation in young children: translation movements".
9311427|a|As a result of their study, Pehoski et al. (1997) have contributed to our knowledge of the development of in-hand manipulation skills in young children. Although knowledge of skill development in children who are typically developing must be applied with caution to children with disabilities, information about normal development provides us with at least the basis for evaluation and treatment planning. Children with moderate and severe problems with hand skills are very unlikely to be appropriate candidates for intervention for in-hand manipulation skills, but children with mild disabilities may be easier for the therapies to identify when using these data on developmental trends and descriptions of strategies for execution of in-hand manipulation skills. Such identification has the potential to lead to intervention that can positively influence the child's performance of a variety of functional tasks that rely on these skills.

9323504|t|Quantitating dialysis using two dialysate samples: a simple, practical and accurate approach for evaluating urea kinetics.
9323504|a|Urea kinetics is now widely used to determine the adequacy of dialysis. Several simplified formulae are currently in use but only a few have been accepted into clinical practice because of their simplicity and ease of calculation. A recent analysis of these formulae showed that for the same set of blood urea values the calculated Kt/V can range from 1.0 to 1.5. We have developed a new dialysate-based method (2DSM) to estimate the urea kinetic parameters using dialysate and blood samples taken at the beginning and at the end of dialysis. The total urea removed (TUR) was calculated from the geometric mean of the two dialysate samples, dialysate flow rate and the duration of dialysis. The Watson formula was used to determine the volume of distribution of urea. A comparison of the 2DSM and the direct dialysate quantification (DDQ) method showed the following results (mean +/- sd, n = 52): for total urea removal (TUR) 697 +/- 32 vs 722 +/- 37 mmol (p = 0.6, r2 = 0.928, y = 101 + 0.83 x, mean difference 25 +/- 76 mmol, see Bland-Altman plot), dialysate urea concentration (Durea) 5.55 +/- 0.25 vs 5.75 +/- 0.29 mmol/l (p = 0.6, r2 = 0.928, y = 0.8 + 0.82 x, mean difference 0.2 +/- 0.6 mmol, see Bland-Altman plot), dialyser clearance (K) 232 +/- 4.4 vs 235 +/- 5.6 ml/min (p = 0.54), Kt/V 1.42 +/- 0.04 vs 1.51 +/- 0.04 (p = 0.21), volume of distribution of urea (Vd) 40.14 +/- 1.04 vs 38.74 +/- 1.2 L, (p = 0.38), and PCR 64.6 +/- 2.6 vs 68.1 +/- 3.1 g/day. We have developed a simple method of determining dialysate-based urea kinetics which requires two dialysate samples, one at the beginning and one at the end of dialysis and a blood sample at the midpoint of dialysis. TUR can be calculated using the dialysate flow rate and the dialysis duration and once this is known all the other kinetic parameters can be calculated.

9344906|t|The HIV-1 matrix domain of Gag is required for Vpu responsiveness during particle release.
9344906|a|HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) facilitates virus particle release. To determine whether Gag is sufficient for generation of a target for Vpu-mediated particle release, we expressed HIV-1 Gag protein in the absence of the other viral genes. The resulting particles were still Vpu responsive. Mutational analysis of Gag indicated that the matrix domain (MA) is required for Vpu responsiveness. However, additional mutations in other domains of Gag, which affect the formation of stable virus particles, also abrogate Vpu responsiveness on total Gag release. Coexpression of the wild-type gag gene and a gag mutant lacking the MA domain renders the MA- mutant Vpu responsive. This indicates that Gag molecules lacking MA are still incorporated into particles through association with wild-type Gag molecules and that the resulting composite particles are sufficient for Vpu-mediated exit.

9267510|t|Effects of parenteral administration of vitamin E on health of periparturient dairy cows.
9267510|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of administration of vitamin E (D-alpha-tocopherol) on the incidence of retained placenta, metritis, and clinical mastitis during early lactation and on tocopherol concentrations. DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled study. ANIMALS: 420 Holstein cows. PROCEDURE: Vitamin E (3,000 mg, IM, once) was administered to 204 cows B to 14 days before expected parturition, and 216 control cows were not treated. The number of cows that had retained placenta, metritis, clinical mastitis, displaced abomasum, and clinically apparent acetonemia or hypocalcemia were recorded. Serum concentrations of tocopherol, the tocopherol:cholesterol ratio, and glutathione-peroxidase activity were determined from samples obtained before administration of vitamin E, 7 and 14 days after administration, and at 30 days after parturition from 36 treated and 36 control cows. RESULTS: Administration of vitamin E significantly decreased the incidence of retained placenta and metritis (13/204 [6.4%] and 8/204: [3.9%], respectively, for the vitamin E-treated group; 27/216 [12.5%] and 19/ 216 [8.8%], respectively, for the untreated group) but did not affect the incidence of clinical mastitis. Serum vitamin E concentration was significantly higher in treated than in control cattle at 7 and 14 days after administration, but serum tocopherol: cholesterol ratio was significantly higher only at 7 days after administration. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Parenteral administration of a single injection of vitamin E before parturition may decrease the incidence of retained placenta and metritis in dairy cows but will increase serum concentrations for 7 to 14 days after administration.

9322197|t|Antibiotic prophylaxis and infection resistance of massive tumor endoprostheses during chemotherapy.
9322197|a|Fifty-five consecutively treated patients with malignant bone tumors had preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy by one oncologist. These same patients had massive bone resection and cemented endoprosthetic bone replacement by one orthopaedic oncologist. Despite 143 instances of documented fever and/or neutropenia in 45 of these 55 patients, no known deep periprosthetic infections developed in any patient during follow-up (mean, 29.4 months; median, 25 months; range, 5 months to 62 months). Broad spectrum antibiotics had been administered in at least 118 instances to these patients (intravenously in hospital, 9 times to 7 patients; intravenously at home, 38 times to 18 patients; and orally at home, 71 times to 26 patients). This study confirms the low infection rate of these massive endoprostheses, despite neutropenic and/or febrile episodes if the patient is given prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotics during the episodes. We support the continued use of massive endoprostheses for bone reconstruction in patients requiring chemotherapy.

Some of the side effects observed in the patients treated in the group A (carbinoxamine-P) were: mild sedation and in some instances hyperexcitability and irritability. However, it was not necessary to discontinue the medication or to modify the dose. In the group B (astemizole-P) was observed only excitement and irritability in some instances by hypersensitivity to the pseudoephedrine. It is very important to consider that the adequate and timely treatment in a patient with otitis serous media will permit to avoid sequels that they can cause, in the long run, a meaningful impact in the language and intellectual development of the child.

9379424|a|The distribution of lymph capillaries and blood capillaries in the synovial membrane was examined immunohistologically with anti-human collagen IV antibody and anti-human von Willebrand factor in 26 human temporomandibular joint (TMJ) samples comprising discs with adjoining synovial membrane from 10 control TMJs and from 16 TMJs with internal derangement. Three different distribution types were observed in the synovial membrane. In the control samples, the occurrence of blood capillaries and lymph capillaries was rare. In mildly hyperplastic synovitis, lymph capillaries were observed just beneath the surface of the synovial membrane, whereas blood capillaries occurred in a little deeper layer of the synovial membrane. In a severely hyperplastic synovitis, both lymph and blood capillaries were observed frequently. The present results suggest that the different distribution patterns of lymph capillaries and blood capillaries reflect the degree of synovitis but can not be attributed to specific clinical symptoms.

9347012|a|The utilization of two WHO reference materials, liquid and lyophilized, permitted international standardization of apolipoprotein measurements. We report here the results of a collaborative study between Arcol, SFBC and SFRL in order to establish reference ranges for apo A1 and B on nine standardized systems. A population of 1027 men and women supposed healthy, 4 to 60 year old, have been selected in two Centers for Preventive Medicine. The serum samples were aliquoted frozen at -20 degrees C the day of sampling and analysed by the manufacturers with IFCC standardized calibrants. A specific quality control was performed using a frozen pool of sera. For apo A1, the centile 2.5 of the reference population varies from 1.04 to 1.16 g/l. The range values for the centile 97.5 varies from 1.87 to 2.24 g/l. For apoB, the centile 2.5 varies from 0.43 to 0.57 g/l, and the centile 97.5 from 1.30 to 1.39 g/l. Only one system has a problem of dispersion with an upper limit equal to 1.20 g/l. These results improve that international standardization allowed actually a good comparability of the results, especially for apoB.

9315328|t|Two new selenoproteins found in the prostatic glandular epithelium and in the spermatid nuclei.
9315328|a|After labeling of rats in vivo with 75Se and protein separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis more than 25 Se-containing bands could be distinguished. Of those proteins which were detected only in certain compartments and might therefore have tissue-specific functions, two were chosen for detailed investigation. A 15 kDa-protein was found in the prostatic epithelium where it accounted for about two thirds of the protein-bound 75Se. It was mainly present in the cytosol but was not released into the prostatic secretion. After gel chromatography it was found in the fraction which contained proteins with molecular masses of about 300 kDa. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis a pI-value of about 4.5 was determined. In the testis a specific Se-containing 34 kDa-protein was observed which appeared after the onset of puberty. It was localized in the spermatid nuclei where it contained about 80% of the Se tracer present and was found to be bound to the DNA. After extraction it partly disintegrated into a 20 kDa-protein. Both compounds contain Se in the form of selenocysteine. The fact that their formation had priority over that of glutathione peroxidase during insufficient Se intake is an indication of their biological significance. Special interest in the prostatic epithelial selenoprotein derives from a possible inverse relationship between the Se status and the incidence of prostate cancer observed in epidemiological studies, whereas with the 34 kDa-selenoprotein its appearance during the condensation phase of the spermatid nuclei might suggest its participation in some processes of sperm maturation.

9341945|a|In this study, the three-dimensional anatomy of the microvascular structure of fungiform papillae (FuP) on the dorsal surface of the bullfrog tongue has been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and angioarchitectural classification has been carried out by means of the capillary loop (L. s) and intra-bridge structure (I. b). FuP from 30 sound bullfrog tongues were used. The following research methods were applied: SEM observation on microvascular cast specimens (MVCS) of bullfrog tongue's FuP were injected with synthetic resin (Mercox). Observation of MVSC showed that the bullfrog tongue FuP consisted of an ascending branch (A. b), L. s, I. b and a descending branch (D. b). Based upon SEM observations of MVCS, FuP can be classified into four types: A, B, C, D types according to A. b, L. s, I. b and D. b. A-type (none I. b) formed from A. b, L. s, D. b only and with no I. b. B-type (one I. b) consisted of A. b, L. s, D. b and one I. b. C-type (two I. b) were composed of A. b, L. s, D. b and two I. b. D-type (three I. b) were composed of A. b, L. s, D. b and three I. b, A. b, L. s, I. b and D. b on each. A, B, C, D types were all same thickness.

9378660|a|DOE facilities are required to conduct environmental surveillance to verify that facility operations are operated within the approved risk envelope and have not caused undue risk to the public and the environment. Given a reduced budget, a strategy for analyzing environmental surveillance data was developed to set priorities for sampling needs. The radiological and metal data collected at Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico, were used to demonstrate the analysis strategy. Sampling locations were prioritized for further investigation and the needs for routine sampling. The process of data management, analysis, prioritization, and presentation has been automated through a custom-designed computer tool. Data collected over years can be analyzed and summarized in a short table format for prioritization and decision making.

9380039|t|21-Hydroxy-6,19-oxidoprogesterone: a novel synthetic steroid with specific antiglucocorticoid properties in the rat.
9380039|a|In the rat, the conformationally highly bent steroid 21-hydroxy-6, 19-oxidoprogesterone efficiently displaces [3H]corticosterone from thymus-glucocorticoid receptors and blocks type II receptors in kidney cytosols but competes with neither [3H]aldosterone for kidney-mineralocorticoid receptors nor [3H]progesterone for uterus-progesterone receptors. It evokes Na+ retention only at very high doses (approximately 100 microg/100 g of rat weight) and is unable to induce tyrosine aminotransferase or to increase glycogen deposits in rat liver. When coincubated with corticosterone or dexamethasone, 2.5 microM 21OH-6OP inhibits 80% of tyrosine aminotransferase induction. It may therefore be used experimentally as an antiglucocorticoid virtually lacking mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid properties as well as affinity for mineralocorticoid or progesterone receptors.

9288441|t|Bipolar depression: treatment options.
9288441|a|OBJECTIVE: To review studies on treatments for bipolar depression and make recommendations for practising clinicians treating patients with bipolar depression. METHOD: Studies that examined various treatments for bipolar depression were evaluated and rated for evidence of efficacy using Periodic Health Examination criteria. The rating for classification of recommendation for an intervention was made taking both the efficacy and the side effects into consideration. RESULTS: Mood stabilizers, cyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are all effective in treating bipolar depression. Almost all antidepressant treatments with the exception of mood stabilizers have been reported to induce a manic-hypomanic switch and rapid cycling. CONCLUSIONS: Mood stabilizers, lithium in particular, are recommended as the first-line treatment. Addition of a second mood stabilizer or a cyclic antidepressant would be an appropriate next step. Newer agents such as lamotrigine offer considerable promise in treating bipolar depressed patients.

The gene encoding the human tissue kallikrein was used because of its powerful hypotensive action. The human kallikrein DNA constructs were placed under the control of the metallothionein metal response element, the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer or the Rous sarcoma virus 3'-LTR. The human tissue kallikrein DNA constructs were incorporated into adenoviral vectors via homologous recombination. The naked plasmid DNA constructs or adenovirus containing the kallikrein gene were first introduced into kidney 293 cells and the expression of human tissue kallikrein was identified by ELISA. The kallikrein gene was delivered into SHR via intramuscular, intravenous, portal vein, intraperitoneal, and intracerebroventricular routes. A single injection of naked human kallikrein DNA constructs caused a prolonged reduction of high blood pressure for up to 8 weeks. Adenoviral-mediated gene delivery results in high efficiency of human tissue kallikrein expression. Immunoreactive human kallikrein was detected in rat serum at the highest level at 1 day post gene delivery. Portal vein delivery of a reporter gene, AdCMV-LacZ, results in intense staining of beta-galactosidase in rat liver, suggesting that recombinant kallikrein is mainly produced in liver and secreted into the circulation. These results show that kallikrein gene delivery causes a sustained reduction of blood pressure in genetically hypertensive rats and provide important information for a potential gene therapy approach to human hypertension and related diseases.

9263235|t|Effects of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 on protein metabolism, gut morphology, and cell-mediated immunity in burned rats.
9263235|a|The effects of recombinant human growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were investigated in burned rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed exclusively by total parenteral nutrition and were subjected to 20% third-degree scald burns. The rats were then divided into the following three groups: (1) the GH group received GH at a dose of 1 IU.kg-1.d-1 for 2d (n = 10); (2) the IGF group received IGF-1 at a dose of 4 mg.kg-1.d-1 for 2d (n = 19); and (3) the control group received saline (n = 17). Cumulative nitrogen balance increased significantly in the GH (P < 0.01) and IGF (P < 0.01) groups as compared with the control group. There were no differences in nitrogen balance between the GH and IGF groups. Blood glucose was decreased in the IGF group (P < 0.01) and increased in the GH group (P < 0.05) as compared with the control group. The intestinal villus height and wall thickness of the GH and IGF groups were significantly greater than those of the control group. Delayed-type hypersensitivity was enhanced in both the GH and the IGF groups as compared with the control group (both P < 0.01). Furthermore, the increase in the IGF group was significantly greater than that in the GH group (P < 0.05). It was concluded that both GH and IGF-1 improve protein metabolism and immune responsiveness, as well as promote proliferation of the intestinal mucosa.

9325098|t|The crystal structure of the catalytic core domain of endoglucanase I from Trichoderma reesei at 3.6 A resolution, and a comparison with related enzymes.
9325098|a|Cellulose is the most abundant polymer in the biosphere. Although generally resistant to degradation, it may be hydrolysed by cellulolytic organisms that have evolved a variety of structurally distinct enzymes, cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases, for this purpose. Endoglucanase I (EG I) is the major endoglucanase produced by the cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma reesei, accounting for 5 to 10% of the total amount of cellulases produced by this organism. Together with EG I from Humicola insolens and T. reesei cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I), the enzyme is classified into family 7 of the glycosyl hydrolases, and it catalyses hydrolysis with a net retention of the anomeric configuration. The structure of the catalytic core domain (residues 1 to 371) of EG I from T. reesei has been determined at 3.6 A resolution by the molecular replacement method using the structures of T. reesei CBH I and H. insolens EG I as search models. By employing the 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS), the structure was refined successfully, despite the limited resolution. The final model has an R-factor of 0.201 (Rfree 0.258). The structure of EG I reveals an extended, open substrate-binding cleft, rather than a tunnel as found in the homologous cellobiohydrolase CBH I. This confirms the earlier proposal that the tunnel-forming loops in CBH I have been deleted in EG I, which has resulted in an open active site in EG I, enabling it to function as an endoglucanase. Comparison of the structure of EG I with several related enzymes reveals structural similarities, and differences that relate to their biological function in degrading particular substrates. A possible structural explanation of the drastically different pH profiles of T. reesei and H. insolens EG I is proposed.

9305568|t|Tacrine does not alter the potency of succinylcholine in the rat.
9305568|a|PURPOSE: Tacrine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used to manage Alzheimer's dementia. Given iv, it prolongs succinylcholine blockade in humans but the effects of chronic oral tacrine are not known. METHODS: Groups of adult rats were given 2.5 mg.kg-1 tacrine (chronic groups) or l ml saline (control) twice daily by gavage for one, two, four or eight weeks. An additional (acute) group received 2.5 mg.kg-1 tacrine iv. Twelve to 18 hr after the last gavage of tacrine or saline, and -20 min after iv tacrine, cumulative dose-response curves of succinylcholine were determined in the tibialis and soleus muscles in anaesthetized, ventilated rats during monitoring of evoked twitch response to indirect (nerve) train-of-four stimulation. RESULTS: The ED50 and ED95 of succinylcholine in control rats were (mean +/- SD) 204 +/- 41 and 382 +/- 96 micrograms.kg-1, respectively in the tibialis muscle, and 280 +/- 52 and 629 +/- 168 micrograms.kg-1 in the soleus muscle (P < 0.05 between muscles). In the acute and chronic tacrine groups, the mean ED50 and ED95 ranged from 166-197 and 277-396 micrograms.kg-1., respectively, in the tibialis muscle, and 248-333 and 546-667 micrograms.kg-1, in the soleus muscle. Dose responses did not differ among acute and chronic tacrine groups and the control group. CONCLUSION: Chronic oral tacrine does not alter muscle response to succinylcholine in the rat. This may not apply to Alzheimer patients receiving chronic tacrine since the interaction between acute tacrine and succinylcholine in the rat differs from that in humans.

9334875|t|Intergenerational perceptions of English speaking and Spanish speaking Mexican-American grandparents.
9334875|a|Hispanics are facing a number of problems, such as poverty, hunger, and a high dropout rate at school. Health-care reform and changes in Medicaid and Medicare are bound to further challenge the resiliency of minority families. To strengthen families from within, relevant programming should be implemented. Information regarding the strengths and needs of Mexican-American grandparents was obtained in order to adapt existing grandparenting programs for this population. Mexican-American grandparents (n = 181), parents (n = 148), and grandchildren (n = 173) provided information on grandparent satisfaction, success, teaching, difficulty, frustration, and information needs. Multivariate analyses of variance found differences for English and Spanish speaking grandparents. Spanish speaking grandparents reported a greater need for information than English speaking grandparents, and more frustration when dealing with adolescents than with younger children. For the English speaking grandparents, all of the generations agreed that grandparents under the age of sixty-one experienced more frustration than their older counterparts, and those who spent more than five hours a month with their grandchildren were more effective in their role. Possible factors that account for the findings are discussed and recommendations for establishing a grandparent program are presented.

9350179|t|Treatment of childhood and adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
9350179|a|In the last 30 years the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has radically changed and intensified and has resulted in improvements in the chances of cure in children to up to 70% but in adults only 30% will achieve long-term disease-free survival. Data from large therapeutic trials have determined good and poor prognostic risk factors which have been of use in planning risk-directed treatment protocols and can influence the chance of cure. However intensification of treatment has also been associated with increased toxicity and significant late effects, particularly in children. In the future it will be necessary for more international collaboration and a more uniform approach to treatment in order to achieve continued improvements in the survival from this disease. In children it will be necessary to focus efforts on improving treatment of relapsed patients: chemotherapy protocols in those with a first remission of > 36 months, or for the high-risk patients with a shorter first remission, new transplantation approaches directed towards enhancing the graft-versus-leukaemia effect are going to be of increasing importance. In adults, continued efforts will be directed towards improving first remission rates with the use of increasingly intensive chemotherapeutic protocols and growth factors. The use of unrelated donor transplantation is also likely to increase, particularly in patients with 'poor-risk' disease.

9326222|t|The efficacy of single-dose administration of thrombopoietin with coadministration of either granulocyte/macrophage or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in myelosuppressed rhesus monkeys.
9326222|a|Thrombopoietin (TPO) was evaluated for efficacy in a placebo-controlled study in rhesus monkeys with concurrent administration of either granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or granulocyte CSF, (G-CSF). Rhesus monkeys were subjected to 5 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI), resulting in 3 weeks of profound pancytopenia, and received either TPO 5 microg/kg intravenously (I.V.) at day 1 (n = 4), GM-CSF 25 microg/kg subcutaneously (S.C.) for 14 days (n = 4), TPO and GM-CSF (n = 4), G-CSF 10 microg/kg/d S.C. for 14 days (n = 3), TPO and G-CSF (n = 4), or placebo (carrier, n = 4; historical controls, n = 8). Single-dose I.V. treatment with TPO 1 day after TBI effectively counteracted the need for thrombocyte transfusions (provided whenever thrombocyte levels were <40 x 10(9)/L) and accelerated platelet reconstitution to normal levels 2 weeks earlier than placebo controls. TPO/GM-CSF was more effective than single-dose TPO alone in stimulating thrombocyte regeneration, with a less profound nadir and a further accelerated recovery to normal thrombocyte counts, as well as a slight overshoot to supranormal levels of thrombocytes. Monkeys treated with TPO/GM-CSF uniformly did not require thrombocyte transfusions, whereas those treated with GM-CSF alone needed two to three transfusions, similar to the placebo-treated monkeys, which required, on average, three transfusions. Also, reticulocyte production was stimulated by TPO and further augmented in monkeys treated with TPO/GM-CSF. TPO alone did not stimulate neutrophil regeneration, whereas GM-CSF shortened the period of neutrophil counts less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L by approximately 1 week; TPO/GM-CSF treatment elevated the neutrophil nadir, but did not further accelerate recovery to normal values. TPO also augemented the neturophil response to G-CSF, resulting in similar patterns of reconstitution following TPO/G-CSF and TPO/GM-CSF treatment. TPO/GM-CSF resulted in significantly increased reconstitution of CD34+ bone marrow cells and progenitor cells such as GM-CFU and BFU-E. Adverse effects of combining TPO with the CSFs were not observed. It is concluded that (1) a single I.V. administration of TPO is sufficient to prevent severe thrombocytopenia following myelosuppression, (2) TPO/G-CSF and TPO/GM-CSF treatment result in distinct response patterns, with TPO/GM-CSF being superior to TPO/G-CSF in stimulating thrombocyte and erythrocyte recovery while being equivalent in stimulating neutrophil recovery; and (3) TPO significantly improves the performance of CSFs in alleviating severe neutropenia.

9251867|t|The relationship between sexual abuse and mild traumatic brain injury.
9251867|a|It remains unclear why some individuals with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) complain of cognitive deficits many months after the injury. Given neuropathological changes associated with prolonged stress, such as occurs with repeated sexual abuse (SA), it seems possible that individuals who experienced SA might be predisposed to greater deficits after MTBI. Four groups of subjects were administered measures of cognitive and emotional functioning. These groups were those with MTBI (n = 10), those with a history of SA (n = 10), those with both MTBI and SA (n = 10), and normal control (NC) subjects (n = 10). Compared to the NC subjects, those with MTBI demonstrated deficits in working memory, those with SA demonstrated deficits in executive functioning, and those with both MTBI and SA demonstrated the greatest number of deficits which were in working memory, executive functioning and memory. Tests of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, while demonstrating significant symptoms in all clinical groups, did not correlate with the neuropsychological tests that differentiated the groups.

9310011|t|The early bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.
9310011|a|The early bactericidal activity (EBA) of ciprofloxacin (CIP) was measured in 80 patients with previously untreated, smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis by counting viable bacilli in sputum collections during the first 2 d of treatment. Groups of about 10 patients were treated daily with graded doses of CIP or with 300 mg isoniazid or with no drug. The mean EBA, defined as the fall in log CFU/ ml sputum/d, increased from -0.011 in the no drug group to 0.046, 0.092, 0.121, and 0.205 in the groups receiving 250, 500, 1,000, or 1,500 mg CIP, respectively, a highly significant trend. These results demonstrate the antimycobacterial activity of CIP in high dosage, though the mean EBAs of 0.55 and 0.66 in two groups receiving isoniazid were much higher.

9350007|t|Coordinated fast-to-slow transitions of myosin and SERCA isoforms in chronically stimulated muscles of euthyroid and hyperthyroid rabbits.
9350007|a|Changes in the patterns of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, isomyosins, and Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) isoforms were studied in long-term (72 d) stimulated fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of euthyroid and hyperthyroid rabbits. The chronic low-frequency stimulation-induced fast-to-slow transitions in MHC isoforms, isomyosins and SERCA isoforms were pronounced in muscles from euthyroid rabbits, but less pronounced in muscles from hyperthyroid rabbits. Thus, hyperthyroidism counteracted to same extent the stimulation-induced fast-to-slow transition. Analyses of all parameters were performed on the same individual muscles, providing information on the co-ordinated expression of SERCA and myosin isoforms. A high correlation (r = 0.97) was detected between relative concentrations of slow SERCA2a and slow MHCI isoforms. This correlation persisted under all experimental conditions, suggesting a co-ordinated expression of slow myosin and Ca(2+)-ATPase isoforms. Conversely, fast SERCA1a was correlated to fast myosin isoforms as a whole.

9283235|t|[Profiles of effects of traditional oriental herbal medicines on central nervous systems in humans--assessment of saiboku-to and saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to using EEG and pharmacokinetics of herbal medicine-derived ingredients as indices]
9283235|a|To elucidate usefulness of traditional oriental herbal medicines in psychiatric fields, we investigated their influences on central nervous systems in humans by using EEG and pharmacokinetics of herbal medicine-derived ingredients as the indices. The subjects were 12 healthy male volunteers who received single oral administration and after that received repeated oral administrations at a daily dose of Saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to or Saiboku-to; EEG was recorded before administration, 1, 3, 6 hours and 10 days after administration. On direct comparison of global field powers calculated from 19-lead EEG before and after administration, it was verified that Saiboku-to possessed effects on central nervous systems. For assessment of pharmacokinetics of ingredients derived from Saiboku-to, pre- and post-treatment serum samples were assayed by HPLC and two ingredients were detected, besides individual differences being observed in their pharmacokinetic profiles. Given that these pharmacokinetics could be interpreted as the phenomena associated with Sho (traditional physical status classifications of patients), the subjects were classified into groups according to individual differences whereby quantitative pharmaco-EEG were employed to elucidate neurotropic effects of Saiboku-to. As the result, following two groups were evidenced: (1) a group demonstrating the mood elevator type after a single administration despite of no changes after repeated administrations, and (2) a group with a shift from the mood elevator type to the nootropics type being observed over time, delineating overt differences in EEG profiles among groups. Consequently, individual differences were evidenced to be involved in onset of neurotropic effects of Saiboku-to, permitting prediction of possible responses following repeated administrations by using EEG profiles. It was also suggested that neurotropic effects of respective ingredients could be anticipated by monitoring the time-course changes of both EEG and plasma levels of these ingredients. In summary, once further studies on oriental herbal medicines might progress based on efficacy assessments of respective ingredients with a clue of the present study, it is conceivable that these findings would play an important role as the objective indices in clinical application of herbal medicines in psychiatric fields, resulting in broadening the usefulness of oriental herbal medicines.

9335543|t|Calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory domain controls "pH-sensing" in the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 through sequence-specific interaction.
9335543|a|The calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain reduces the affinity of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 for intracellular H+ by exerting an autoinhibitory function in quiescent cells. We replaced this domain (aa 637-656) with homologous segments from other NHE isoforms (NHE2 and 4) or functionally similar regions from other sources (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, CaM-dependent protein kinase II, plasma membrane Ca2+-pump, or CaM-binding peptide Trp3). The NHE-1-, NHE2-, and NHE4-segments bound CaM with Kds of 16, 130, and 27 nM, respectively. These chimeric molecules were expressed in the exchanger-deficient cell PS120. NHE1 with incorporated NHE2-segment was activated in response to Ca2+-mobilizing agents ionomycin and thrombin resulting in an alkaline shift of the intracellular pH (pHi)-dependence of 22Na+ uptake, as was the case with the intact rat NHE2. In contrast, incorporation of the NHE4-segment or other CaM-binding segments induced a constitutive alkaline shift of pHi-dependence with concomitant abolishment of Ca2+-dependent activation, indicating that these segments could not function as an autoinhibitory domain in NHE1. Detailed analyses revealed that Leu639, Lys651 and Tyr652, conserved in the NHE1- and NHE2-segments, but not in the NHE4-segment, are important for the autoinhibition. Furthermore, 125I-labeled CaM-binding peptide from NHE1 was efficiently crosslinked to the NHE1 protein, suggesting that the inhibitory domain physically interacts with part(s) of the molecule. Together, these findings support the notion that the reduction of H+ affinity in Na+/H+ exchange occurs through a mechanism involving a highly sequence-specific interaction of the inhibitory domain with its putative acceptor in NHE1.

9356063|t|Cardiopulmonary physiology of primary blast injury.
9356063|a|OBJECTIVE: Bomb blast survivors are occasionally found in profound shock and hypoxic without external signs of injury. We investigated the cardiovascular and pulmonary responses of rats subjected to a blast pressure wave. DESIGN: Prospectively randomized, controlled animal study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were instrumented and subjected to a blast pressure wave of different intensities from a blast wave generator. Cardiopulmonary parameters were recorded for 3 hours or until death. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cardiovascular response to a blast pressure wave was immediate bradycardia, hypotension, and low cardiac index. Three hours later, the rats developed hypotension, low cardiac index, and low stroke volume. Interestingly, systemic vascular resistance remained unchanged. The pulmonary response was a decreased PaO2 and stable PacO2, suggesting a ventilation-perfusion mismatch from massive pulmonary hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Blast-induced circulatory shock resulted from immediate myocardial depression without a compensatory vasoconstriction. Hypoxia presumably resulted from a ventilation-perfusion mismatch caused by pulmonary hemorrhage.

9323920|t|Differences in hepatitis B markers between clinical and preclinical health care personnel.
9323920|a|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an occupational risk for health care personnel (HCP). Vaccination is an important preventive measure but high cost of vaccination limits the feasibility of giving vaccine to all HCP. To find an optimum approach for vaccination we conducted a study on HCP in Maulana Azad Medical College and associated LNJPN hospital. A total of 162 subjects were screened. Eight were excluded because of prior vaccination against HBV. Two groups of subjects were selected namely preclinical and clinical. The preclinical group comprised first year medical students and the clinical group comprised of HCP who have been exposed to clinical departments. The subjects were screened for HBsAg, anti HBs and anti HBc viral markers. 86 subjects were screened in the preclinical group. Two (2.3%) were positive for HBsAG; 16 (18%) and 9 (10.4%) were positive for anti HBs and anti HBc respectively. In the clinical group a total of 68 subjects were screened. Amongst them 1.4% were positive for HBsAg; 47 (69%) and 38 (55%) were positive for anti HBs and anti HBc respectively. The study revealed that there was a significant difference in the titre of the viral markers in the preclinical group as compared to the clinical group. Seventy (82%) of preclinical subjects were at high risk for the infection as they moved into clinical departments. Few subjects will be excluded from the vaccination schedule based on anti HBs screening and hence screening prior to vaccination is not cost effective. However in the clinical group 69% will be excluded from the vaccination schedule based on anti HBs positivity and screening will save up to 60% of cost involved in vaccination.

9380133|t|[Malignant pleural mesothelioma in general practice; complex pain problems]
9380133|a|In three patients, men aged 67, 57 and 69 years, malignant pleural mesothelioma was diagnosed. All three had worked as coal miners and were presented with thoracic pain. They were among seven cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma diagnosed in a period of five years in one suburban general practice (adherence: 5600 patients) in the former mining area in the province of Limburg. The terminal phase of the disease was characterized by intractable pain. High doses of opioids and adjuvants were necessary to achieve acceptable pain relief. It is suggested that step one of the 'analgesic ladder for cancer pain management' of the WHO (non-opioids) should be followed soon by step three (strong opioids). Because the incidence of pleural mesothelioma is not yet decreasing, it is important to know that pain management remains a serious problem.

9303578|t|The interaction of endothelin receptor responses in the isolated perfused rat lung.
9303578|a|To gain more insight into the complex pulmonary interactions of endothelins (ET), we studied airway and vascular responses to endothelins in isolated perfused rat lungs in the presence of the novel ET(B)-receptor antagonist BQ788. In particular we focused on airway responses and on prostacyclin release. The effectiveness of BQ788 in our system was shown by its ability to concentration-dependently prevent vasoconstriction (IC50 0.1 microM), bronchoconstriction (IC50 0.1 microM) and prostacyclin production (IC50 < 0.1 microM) induced by the ET(B)-receptor agonist IRL1620 (1 nmol). Airway responses to ET-1: ET-1-induced bronchoconstriction was aggravated by BQ123 (1 or 8 microM), while BQ788 pretreatment (1 or 8 microM) showed no significant effect. Simultaneous treatment with 8 microM BQ123 and BQ788 attenuated the ET-1-induced bronchoconstriction. Vascular responses to ET-1: ET-1 (1 nmol)-induced vasoconstriction was potentiated by BQ788 (1 or 8 microM), but attenuated by the ET(A)-receptor antagonist BQ123 (1 microM). In the presence of BQ788 diminished amounts of the stable prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-PGF1alpha were detected in the perfusate. Simultaneous treatment with 8 microM BQ123 and BQ788 completely prevented the ET-1-induced vasoconstriction. Conclusions: Both ET(A)- and ET(B)-receptors contribute to ET-1-induced vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction. The ET-1-induced vasoconstriction is attenuated by stimulation of ET(B)-receptors, a response that is partly mediated by prostacyclin. Due to the mutual interactions between ET(A)- and ET(B)-receptors, simultaneous inhibition of both receptors is required to prevent the deleterious effects of ET-1 on lung functions.

9358126|t|A comparison of recombinant hirudin with a low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent thromboembolic complications after total hip replacement.
9358126|a|BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo total hip replacement have a high risk of thromboembolic complications. Recombinant hirudin (desirudin), a specific inhibitor of thrombin, represents a new development in antithrombotic therapy. We compared the efficacy and safety of desirudin with those of a low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) for the prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing primary total hip replacement. METHODS: Both treatments, which were assigned in a randomized, double-blind manner, were started preoperatively: enoxaparin on the evening before surgery, and desirudin within 30 minutes before the start of surgery. The dose of desirudin was 15 mg subcutaneously twice daily, and the dose of enoxaparin was 40 mg subcutaneously once daily. The duration of treatment was 8 to 12 days. Deep-vein thrombosis was verified by bilateral venography performed at the end of the treatment period or earlier, if there were clinical signs of deep-vein thrombosis. RESULTS: At 31 centers in 10 European countries, 2079 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive desirudin or enoxaparin. A total of 1587 patients were included in the primary analysis of efficacy. In the desirudin group, as compared with the enoxaparin group, there was a significantly lower rate of proximal deep-vein thrombosis (4.5 vs. 7.5 percent, P=0.01; relative reduction in risk, 40.3 percent) and a lower overall rate of deep-vein thrombosis (18.4 vs. 25.5 percent, P=0.001; relative reduction in risk, 28.0 percent). The safety profiles were similar in the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: When administered 30 minutes before total hip replacement surgery, desirudin is more effective than enoxaparin in preventing deep-vein thrombosis.

9322672|t|Vascular complications of thoracic outlet syndrome.
9322672|a|Vascular complications of thoracic outlet syndrome are uncommon but may result in significant long-term disability. This report documents a retrospective review of 17 such patients. Ten patients presented with acute onset of upper extremity swelling and axillosubclavian vein thrombosis. One patient presented with chronic, intermittent arm swelling and subclavian vein stenosis. Three patients presented with acute symptoms of upper extremity emboli, and three presented with chronic arm claudication. Cervical ribs were discovered in four patients with arterial symptoms and in no patients with venous symptoms. All ten patients with acute venous thrombosis underwent successful thrombolysis, with venous stenosis uncovered in 8. Thrombolysis was also performed for two patients with arterial emboli. All 17 patients underwent surgical decompression of the thoracic outlet, 16 via a supraclavicular approach and one via a transaxillary approach. One subclavian arteriotomy with endarterectomy and one resection of a subclavian artery aneurysm were performed at the time of decompression. Repeat venography after decompression demonstrated persistent venous stenosis in one patient that was treated with balloon angioplasty and stenting. After a mean of 22 months' follow-up, 12 patients had no residual symptoms, and 5 had experienced significant improvement of symptoms. In conclusion, a combined approach of thrombolysis and surgical decompression of the thoracic outlet provides a salutary outcome in a majority of patients.

9379505|t|Association between p53 mutation and clinicopathological features of non-small cell lung cancer.
9379505|a|Genetic alterations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene, determined by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analyses, and the clinicopathological characteristics of 108 patients with non-small cell lung cancer were compared. Mutations in this gene were found in 37 of the 108 patients (34%): in 30% (23/76) of those with adenocarcinomas, 46% (12/26) of those with squamous cell, 33% (1/3) of those with large cell and 33% (1/3) of those with adenosquamous carcinomas. No associations between the incidence of p53 mutations and the histological or cytological subtypes of adenocarcinomas were found. The analysis of types of mutations, however, showed that GC transversion was relatively common in papillary and clara subtypes, whereas it accounted for only 17% at most of p53 mutations in tubular and bronchial surface epithelial cell subtypes of adenocarcinomas. Univariate analyses revealed that large tumor size, high nodal stage and positive vascular invasion of non-small cell lung cancers, and high nodal stage and high-grade nuclear atypia of adenocarcinomas were associated significantly with p53 mutations. Multivariate analyses showed that the tumor sizes of non-small cell lung cancer correlated with p53 mutations with marginal significance (P = 0.099) whereas nuclear atypia of adenocarcinomas correlated significantly (P = 0.028). No differences between the overall or relapse-free survival rates of patients with and without p53 mutations in non-small cell lung cancers or adenocarcinomas were found. These findings indicate that p53 mutations in adenocarcinomas of the lung are associated with the malignant phenotype of tumor cells, but not with patient survival.

9331500|t|Bone marrow mononuclear cell count does not predict neutrophil and platelet recovery following autologous bone marrow transplant: value of the colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) assay.
9331500|a|The common use of the marrow autograft mononuclear cell (MNC) count derives from positive correlative studies following allogeneic transplantation and from earlier conflicting data regarding the value of the bone marrow autograft colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) assay for prediction hematologic recovery after ABMT. We conducted a retrospective analysis at our institution to determine whether autograft CFU-GM levels predict engraftment of neutrophils and platelets after ABMT in heavily pretreated patients with hematologic malignancies. Between 1 January 1993 and 1 March 1995, 58 heavily pretreated patients received only marrow cells as the autograft product. Patients with Hodgkin's disease (n = 25), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 19), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 14) underwent intensive therapy with etoposide and melphalan. Unpurged marrow containing a minimum of 1.5 x 10(8)/kg (range: 1.5-4.8) was infused. Median time to an absolute neutrophil count > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 21 days (range 10-270) and median time to a platelet count > or = 20 x 10(9)/L independent of transfusions was 44 days (range 13-317). There was no correlation between autograft MNC count and neutrophil or platelet engraftment. However, a correlation between autograft CFU-GM and both platelet and neutrophil recovery was demonstrated with a threshold CFU-GM of 3 x 10(4)/kg; delayed neutrophil recovery was observed in 79% of patients below this threshold compared to only 9% in those with an autograft CFU-GM level of more than 3 x 10(4)/kg (p = 0.0001). Similarly, platelet recovery was delayed in 76% of patients below, and 20% of those above this threshold (p = 0.003). We conclude that marrow autograft CFU-GM is predictive of engraftment of both platelets and neutrophils in heavily pretreated patients after ABMT for hematological malignancies.

9382486|t|Effect of different proteases on bitterness of hemoglobin hydrolysates.
9382486|a|Hemoglobin was hydrolyzed by several enzymes (Proctase, Alcalase, Neutrase, papain). Hydrolysates were analyzed (degree of hydrolysis, gel permeation on Superose 12 column, tasting) and fractionated by ultrafiltration and 2-butanol extraction. The bitter peptides were isolated and identified. The results were compared with those already obtained with peptic hemoglobin hydrolysates. All the findings were confirmed. Ultrafiltration concentrated bitter compounds in the fraction corresponding to 500-5000 Da, and these compounds were selectively extracted by 2-butanol. All the bitter peptides belonged to the same fragment of the beta-chain of bovine hemoglobin. Finally, the use of a Superose 12 chromatographic column for easy detection of bitter hydrolysates without sensory analysis could be generalized for hemoglobin hydrolysates.

9335335|t|Components and dynamics of DNA replication complexes in S. cerevisiae: redistribution of MCM proteins and Cdc45p during S phase.
9335335|a|In S. cerevisiae, the chromatin structure of DNA replication origins changes as cells become competent for DNA replication, suggesting that G1 phase-specific association of replication factors with origin DNA regulates entry into S phase. We demonstrate that ORC, Cdc45p, and MCM proteins are components of prereplication complexes (pre-RC). The MCM-origin association is dependent upon ORC and Cdc6p. During S phase, MCM proteins and Cdc45p dissociate from origin DNA and associate with nonorigin DNA with similar kinetics as DNA Polymerase epsilon, which is present at DNA replication forks. Our results identify protein components of the pre-RC and a novel replication complex appearing at the G1/S transition (the RC), and suggest that after initiation MCM proteins and Cdc45p move with eukaryotic replication forks.

9330258|t|Effects of Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis infection on Anopheles stephensi egg development and resorption.
9330258|a|It has been shown previously that infection with Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis reduces the number of eggs produced by female Anopheles stephensi. Here we examine the mechanism underlying fecundity reduction. Ovaries from infected and uninfected (control) female mosquitoes were examined 12, 24 or 36 h after blood-feeding during the first gonotrophic cycle (replicated) or the second gonotrophic cycle (unreplicated). Follicular development was assessed according to Christophers' stages and the proportions of developing and resorbing follicles per ovary were determined. Resorption of some follicles commenced within 12 h of blood-feeding, affecting significantly more follicles in the infected females: 1.1% v. 3.2%. The difference was greatest 36 h after blood-feeding: 25% reduction (10 v. 35%) in the first cycle; 16% reduction (9 v. 25%) in the second gonotrophic cycle. The mean speed of oogenesis was also found to be significantly retarded in infected mosquitoes. During the second gonotrophic cycle, for example, only 92-94% of follicles reached stage III by 24 h and stage IV by 36 h in infected females, whereas all the developing follicles of uninfected females reached these stages more or less synchronously in the time specified.

9346280|t|Basic residues in the 74-83 and 191-198 segments of protein kinase CK2 catalytic subunit are implicated in negative but not in positive regulation by the beta-subunit.
9346280|a|Protein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitous pleiotropic serine/threonine protein kinase whose holoenzyme is comprised of two catalytic (alpha and/or alpha') and two non-catalytic, beta-subunits. The beta-subunit possesses antagonist functions that can be physically dissected by generating synthetic fragments encompassing its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Here we show that by mutating basic residues in the 74-77 and in the 191-198 regions of the alpha-subunit, the negative regulation by the beta-subunit and by its N-terminal synthetic fragment CK2beta-(1-77), which is observable using calmodulin as a substrate for phosphorylation, is drastically reduced. In contrast, the positive regulation by a C-terminal, CK2beta-(155-215)-peptide is unaffected or even increased. Moreover, the basal activity of alpha mutants K74-77A, K79R80K83A, and R191R195K198A toward specific peptide substrates is stimulated by the beta-subunit many fold more than that of alpha wild type, while extrastimulation by beta mutant D55L56E57A, observable with alpha wild type, is abolished with these mutants. These data support the conclusion that down regulation by the acidic residues clustered in the N-terminal moiety of beta is mediated by basic residues in the 74-83 and in the 191-198 sequences of the alpha-subunit. These are also implicated in substrate recognition consistent with the concept that the N-terminal acidic region of the beta subunit operates as a pseudosubstrate. In contrast, another CK2alpha mutant, V66A, is more sensitive to inhibition by either beta-subunit or its N-terminal, CK2beta-(1-77)-peptide, while its stimulation by the C-terminal peptide, CK2beta-(155-215), is comparable to that of alpha wild type. These observations suggest an indirect role of Val66 in conferring to the alpha-subunit a conformation less sensitive to down regulation by beta-subunit.

9378063|t|[Refractory hydrothorax in primary biliary cirrhosis: successful treatment with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt]
9378063|a|HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 55-year-old woman with known primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) was hospitalized because of increasing dyspnoea. A year before she had for the first time experienced a right-sided pleural effusion which had to be drained every 4 weeks. Physical examination revealed dullness on percussion and greatly decreased breath sounds on auscultation over the entire right thorax. In addition there were signs of moderate ascites and leg oedema. INVESTIGATIONS: Chest radiograph showed a homogeneous shadowing of the right thorax without mediastinal shift. Diagnostic thoracocentesis produced a serous effusion, a transudate on chemical analysis, comparable to the composition of the ascitic fluid. Bacteriological and cytological tests on both fluids were unremarkable. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The right pleural effusion was presumed to be due to a hydrothorax from the ascites caused by portal hypertension associated with the PBC. Despite continuous diuretic treatment and thoracocentesis with albumin substitution every 3 days there was no improvement and implantation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) was performed. This effectively lowered portal pressure and markedly improved the patient's condition so that further thoracocentesis were no longer necessary. 3 weeks after TIPSS implantation she was discharged in good condition. Radiography 3 weeks later demonstrated continued reduction in the hydrothorax. CONCLUSION: Hydrothorax is a rare complication of liver cirrhosis. TIPSS implantation can provide lasting resolution and corresponding clinical improvement of a hydrothorax, especially in those conditions which are refractory to diuretic treatment and thoracocentesis.

9345446|t|Cardiovascular regulation in multiple sclerosis.
9345446|a|Traditional assessments of autonomic nervous system function have depended on invasive and complex procedures. Vagal power, which is the respiratory component of heart rate variability (HRV) is an alternative and non-invasive measure for indexing autonomic nervous control of the heart. In the current study, 18 multiple sclerosis (MS) and 20 healthy subjects matched with respect to age, education and intelligence served as subjects. The MS group showed significantly lower vagal power during natural and paced breathing than healthy subjects. Importantly, heart rate did not differ between the two groups. If MS patients exhibit abnormalities in mechanisms mediating cardiac parasympathetic control, the impact on quality of life and vulnerability to adverse cardiac events need to be further evaluated. The results of this study may have implications with respect to the feasibility of using HRV as both a diagnostic and prognostic tool for evaluating parasympathetic nervous system dysfunction and in providing valuable information for developing more effective treatment and rehabilitation strategies.

9316922|t|Limited value of PCR for detection of Toxoplasma gondii in blood from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.
9316922|a|Cerebral toxoplasmosis is a common, opportunistic, and often life-threatening disease in HIV-infected patients. Diagnosis is supported mainly by clinical evidence and computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans, but brain images may share features with other brain diseases occurring in HIV-infected patients. To determine the diagnostic value of PCR for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii in blood from HIV-infected patients, we examined 89 blood samples from 59 HIV-infected patients. PCR and Southern blot hybridization were done with DNA extracted from blood samples from 20 patients with confirmed cerebral toxoplasmosis and from 10 patients with suspected but not confirmed cerebral toxoplasmosis. The samples were taken before and 7 to 10 days after the beginning of antiparasitic therapy. For 9 patients who suffered from cerebral toxoplasmosis more than 6 months prior to the study and for 20 patients without any evidence for toxoplasmosis only one blood sample per patient was examined. PCR gave positive results with 5 of the 20 blood samples from patients who suffered from cerebral toxoplasmosis. After 7 to 10 days of therapy PCR results became negative in all these five cases. No amplification was seen with DNA from blood samples from the other 54 patients as the target. The results presented here show that PCR testing of blood samples from HIV-infected patients is of limited value for the diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis. The sensitivity was only 25%, but the specificity was very high (100%), so this technique may be useful for discriminating between cerebral toxoplasmosis and other brain diseases which may be mistaken for toxoplasmosis.

9296268|t|Molecular cloning and characterization of the bovine tuftelin gene.
9296268|a|The bovine tuftelin gene was cloned and its structure determined by DNA sequence analysis and comparison to that of bovine tuftelin cDNA. The analyses demonstrated that the cDNA contains a 1014-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 338 residues with a calculated mol. wt of 38,630 and an isoelectric point of 5.85. These results differ from those previously published, (1991) which contained a different conceptual amino acid sequence for the carboxy terminal region and identified a different termination codon. The protein does not appear to share homology or domain motifs with any other known protein. The gene consists of 13 exons ranging in size from 66 to 1531 bp, the latter containing the encoded carboxyterminal and 3' untranslated regions. The exons are embedded in more than 28 kbp of genomic DNA. Codons are generally not divided at exon/intron borders. Several alternatively spliced transcripts were identified by DNA sequence analysis of the isolated products produced by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction.

9343165|t|Mutation of Tp53 contributes to the malignant phenotype of Abelson virus-transformed lymphoid cells.
9343165|a|Abelson murine leukemia virus transforms pre-B cells in vitro and induces rapid-onset pre-B-cell lymphoma in vivo. Expression of an active v-Abl protein tyrosine kinase is required for the oncogenic functions of the virus. Despite the strong growth-stimulatory signal provided by v-Abl, the virus-induced tumors are clonal or oligoclonal, and changes in the growth and oncogenic potential of in vitro transformants occur during the derivation of the cell lines. Both of these features suggest that v-Abl expression must be complemented by changes in expression of one or more cellular genes for cells to acquire a fully malignant phenotype. Such genes could include other oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Among the latter is Tp53, a gene mutated in many spontaneous cancers. To determine if mutation of the Tp53 tumor suppressor gene plays a role in Abelson virus transformation, conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to examine p53 expression in a panel of Abelson virus-transformed pre-B cells. Expression of mutant forms of p53 was detected in over 40% of the isolates. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of point mutations affecting the highly conserved central portion of the protein. These mutations interfered with the ability of p53 to activate transcription from a promoter containing p53-responsive elements and to induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In addition, cells expressing mutant forms of p53 induced a higher frequency of tumors with a more rapid course compared to transformants expressing wild-type p53. These data suggest that Tp53 is one important cellular gene involved in malignant transformation by Abelson virus.

9351973|t|Phosphorylation of the Kv2.1 K+ channel alters voltage-dependent activation.
9351973|a|The voltage-gated delayed-rectifier-type K+ channel Kv2.1 is expressed in high-density clusters on the soma and proximal dendrites of mammalian central neurons; thus, dynamic regulation of Kv2.1 would be predicted to have an impact on dendritic excitability. Rat brain Kv2.1 polypeptides are phosphorylated extensively, leading to a dramatically increased molecular mass on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Phosphoamino acid analysis of Kv2.1 expressed in transfected cells and labeled in vivo with 32P shows that phosphorylation was restricted to serine residues and that a truncation mutant, DeltaC318, which lacks the last 318 amino acids in the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus, was phosphorylated to a much lesser degree than was wild-type Kv2.1. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies showed that the voltage-dependence of activation of DeltaC318 was shifted to more negative membrane potentials than Kv2.1 without differences in macroscopic kinetics; however, the differences in the voltage-dependence of activation between Kv2.1 and DeltaC318 were eliminated by in vivo intracellular application of alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that these differences were due to differential phosphorylation. Similar analyses of other truncation and point mutants indicated that the phosphorylation sites responsible for the observed differences in voltage-dependent activation lie between amino acids 667 and 853 near the distal end of the Kv2.1 carboxyl terminus. Together, these parallel biochemical and electrophysiological results provide direct evidence that the voltage-dependent activation of the delayed-rectifier K+ channel Kv2. 1 can be modulated by direct phosphorylation of the channel protein; such modulation of Kv2.1 could dynamically regulate dendritic excitability.

9309626|t|Effects of estradiol on substrate turnover during exercise in amenorrheic females.
9309626|a|The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of transdermal estradiol (E2) replacement on substrate utilization during exercise. Amenorrheic females (N = 6) performed three exercise trials following 72 h of placebo (C 72) and 72 and 144 h of medicated transdermal estradiol (E2) treatment (E2 72 and E2 144). Exercise involved 90 min of treadmill running at 65% VO2max followed by timed exercise to exhaustion at 85% VO2max. Resting blood samples were obtained for glucose, insulin, free fatty acids (FFA), and E2. Exercise blood samples were obtained for E2, lactate, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Rates of appearance and disposal were calculated for glucose and glycerol using a primed, continuous infusion of [6,6-2H] glucose and [2H5] glycerol. Medicated transdermal placement increased E2 significantly at rest, before exercise (35.03 +/- 12.3, 69.5 +/- 20.1, and 73.1 +/- 31.6 pg.mL-1 for the C 72, E2 72, and E2 144 trials, respectively, P < 0.05). Resting FFA increased significantly following E2 treatment (0.28 +/- 0.16, 0.41 +/- 0.27, and 0.40 +/- 0.21 mmol.L-1 for the C 72, E2 72, and E2 144 trials, respectively, P < 0.05). Glucose Ra was significantly decreased during exercise as a result of E2 replacement (21.9 +/- 7.7, 18.9 +/- 6.2, and 18.9 +/- 5.6 mumol.kg-1.min-1 for the C 72, E2 72, and E2 144 trials, respectively, P < 0.05). Average glucose Rd also decreased during exercise as a result of E2 replacement (21.3 +/- 7.8, 18.5 +/- 6.4, and 18.6 +/- 5.8 mumol.kg-1.min-1 for the C 72, E2 72, and E2 144 trials, respectively, P < 0.05). However, the estimated relative contribution of plasma glucose and muscle glycogen to total carbohydrate oxidation was similar among the trials. Epinephrine values were significantly lower late in exercise during the E2 72 and E2 144 trials, compared with the C 72 trial (P < 0.05). These results indicate that elevated E2 levels can alter glucose metabolism at rest and during moderate intensity exercise as a result of decreased gluconeogenesis, epinephrine secretion, and/or glucose transport.

9296327|t|Excretion of citalopram in breast milk.
9296327|a|AIMS: The objective of this study was to measure to secretion of the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor citalopram in breast milk. METHODS: The excretion of citalopram in breast milk was studied at steady-state conditions in two patients with depression and in one healthy volunteer after ingestion of a single dose citalopram. RESULTS: Milk/serum concentration ratios based on single pairs of samples from the two patients ranged from 1.16 to 1.88. Based on milk concentration data from the patients, the absolute dose ingested by a suckling infant would be 4.3-17.6 micrograms kg-1 day-1, and the relative dose 0.7-5.9% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. Based on area-under-the-time-concentration curves from the healthy volunteer, the milk/serum ratio was 1.00, the absolute dose to the infant during steady-state conditions would be 11.2 micrograms kg-1 day-1 and the relative dose 1.8% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. CONCLUSION: The study shows that the relative dose to a suckling infant is close to that reported for fluoxetine, and higher than reported for fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline.

9348196|t|Simultaneous measurement of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the third ventricular cerebrospinal fluid and hypophyseal portal blood of the ewe.
9348196|a|GnRH is present in the hypophyseal portal blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of several species investigated, including sheep, but the precise relationship between these two compartments of GnRH is unknown. In the present study, ovariectomized steroid-treated ewes were surgically prepared for the simultaneous collection of portal blood and third ventricular CSF. Ten-minute samples were collected for pulse analysis after progesterone removal and hourly for comparisons during the estradiol-induced LH surge. The time of onset of the portal (15.3 +/- 0.5 h after estradiol) and CSF (15.9 +/- 0.2 h) GnRH surges was similar and occurred coincidentally with the LH surge (15.6 +/- 0.4 h). The period of the surge during which GnRH concentrations exceeded half-maximal levels (portal, 7.3 +/- 1.5 h; CSF, 7.3 +/- 0.3 h) was the same and outlasted the corresponding LH surge period (3.3 +/- 0.3 h). LH pulses started and peaked later than the corresponding portal GnRH pulses (onset difference, 10 +/- 1 min; peak difference, 16 +/- 1 min; P < 0.01 for both), but the times of pulse onset and peak were not significantly different from those of concomitant CSF GnRH pulses (onset difference, 8 +/- 6 min; peak difference, 8 +/- 4 min). Although the times of pulse onset and peak did not differ between the portal and CSF GnRH compartments (onset difference, 4 +/- 6 min; peak difference, 6 +/- 2 min), CSF GnRH pulses were longer than their portal counterparts (CSF, 38 +/- 3 min; portal, 15 +/- 1 min; P < 0.01). The amplitude of jugular LH pulses was strongly correlated (r2 = 0.85) with portal GnRH pulse amplitude, but not with that of CSF GnRH pulses (r2 = 0.45); there was no correlation between portal and CSF GnRH pulse amplitudes (r2 = 0.25). These data show that third ventricular CSF GnRH reliably relates neurosecretory events occurring within the hypophyseal portal system at the time of the preovulatory LH surge, but is not as precise as portal GnRH in marking a LH pulse.
