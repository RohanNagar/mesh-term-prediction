15109919|t|Hammerhead ribozyme targeting connective tissue growth factor mRNA blocks transforming growth factor-beta mediated cell proliferation.
15109919|a|PURPOSE: Excessive scarring following trauma or surgery of cornea, conjunctiva or retina can greatly impair visual outcome. At present, no agents are clinically available that selectively reduce activity of genes that regulate fibrosis. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has been linked to fibrosis in several tissues, including cornea and conjunctiva. In this study, hammerhead ribozymes targeting CTGF mRNA were synthesized, kinetic parameters were measured, and the effect on TGF-beta-mediated cell proliferation was measured in cultured human fibroblasts. METHODS: The mRNA sequence of human CTGF was scanned for potential hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites, and predicted secondary folding structures around the sites were calculated. Synthetic 12mer ribozymes and 33mer oligonucleotide mRNA targets corresponding to two sites were synthesized, and kinetic constants calculated from Hanes-Wolff plots of in vitro cleavage reactions. The ribozyme with higher percentage cleavage and kinetic rate was cloned into an expression plasmid (pTR-UF21) and stably transfected into cultured human fibroblasts. An inactive ribozyme plasmid served as a negative control. The effects of the ribozyme on expression of TGF-beta-induced CTGF mRNA and protein levels were measured using ELISA and real-time TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR. Finally, the effect of the CTGF ribozyme on TGF-beta-mediated proliferation of fibroblasts was measured using a non-radioactive cell proliferation microtiter assay. RESULTS: Of the eight potential hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites in human CTGF mRNA, two sites (CHR 745, and CHR 859) were identified with optimal secondary folding. CHR 859 cleaved 94% of the target mRNA, compared to 46% cleavage for CHR 745 after 16 hr of reaction. CHR 859 had a K(m) of 1.56 microM and a K(cat) of 2.97 min(-1), while CHR 745 had a K(m) of 7.80 microM and a K(cat) of 5.7 min(-1). The turnover numbers (K(cat)/K(m)) of CHR 859 and CHR 745 were 1.9 x 10(6) M min(-1) and 7.4 x 10(5) M min(-1), respectively, indicating CHR 859 is 2.6 times more efficient than CHR 745 in destroying CTGF mRNA. Stable transfection of CHR 859 into human fibroblasts reduced CTGF mRNA levels 55% and protein levels 72% compared to the inactive ribozyme control. Furthermore, TGF-beta-induced cell proliferation was reduced 90% in fibroblasts stably transfected with CHR 859 compared to control cell groups. CONCLUSIONS: The CHR 859 hammerhead ribozyme cleaved human CTGF mRNA with high kinetic efficiency in vitro, effectively reduced levels of CTGF mRNA and protein in cultured human fibroblasts, and blocked TGF-beta-induced cell proliferation without nonspecific toxicity. These data support the concept that CTGF mediates TGF-beta-induced cell proliferation, and imply that regulating CTGF expression with ribozymes may be effective in reducing ocular scarring.

6874270|t|Experimental anterior uveitis after subcutaneous injection of feline sarcoma virus.
6874270|a|Feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) is a naturally occurring virus that causes spontaneous tumors in cats. The immunologic and morphologic characteristics of these tumors have been studied extensively. It was recently observed in experiments undertaken to induce systemic malignancy with this virus, that severe uveitis and clinical blindness occurred. An investigation of the ophthalmologic changes was undertaken. A fulminent anterior uveitis was produced in cats by a series of subcutaneous injections of live FeLV-FeSV. This intraocular inflammation occurred in five of six animals using high viral titers, and four of seven with lower titers, resulting from the freeze thaw process. On histopathologic examination, most animals demonstrated dysplastic changes of the ciliary body in addition to the iridocyclitis. The remainder of the eye was unaffected. These animals developed systemic tumors unaccompanied by local inflammation, many of which spontaneously regressed. Notable features of this potential model for uveitis are that (1) direct injection into the eye is unnecessary, and (2) intravenous administration inducing immune tolerance with antigenic overload presented to the spleen is avoided. This inflammatory reaction seems to be specific to the iris and ciliary body. Levels of live virus detected in the aqueous humor exceeded those in the serum. These results suggest that the virus may be actively secreted by the ciliary epithelium, or may preferentially proliferate within the eye.

8638391|t|In vitro responsiveness of Babesia bovis to imidocarb dipropionate and the selection of a drug-adapted line.
8638391|a|A South African stock of Babesia bovis was successfully resuscitated from liquid nitrogen, and cultured in microaerophilous stationary phase. The in vitro susceptibility of the B. bovis stock to titrated concentrations of imidocarb dipropionate was observed and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC) was determined (8.7 x 10(7) g ml-1). A drug-adapted line was developed by culture in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of imidocarb dipropionate and it had an IC50 eight times higher than that of its original stock (6.6 x 10(-6) g ml-1). The drug-adapted line was cryopreserved and resuscitated from liquid nitrogen. Continuous culture of the non-drug adapted line through 15 subcultures did not change the IC50 (8.3 x 10(-7) g ml-1).

8407686|t|Improving dietary practices of elderly individuals: the power of prompting feedback, and social reinforcement.
8407686|a|Three intervention packages consisting of (a) enhanced prompts, feedback, and social reinforcement; (b) a lottery; and (c) serving as a confederate were added and removed in sequence as adjacent conditions in an extended withdrawal design to assess their effects on the dietary choices of elderly persons. Participants were 3 elderly residents of an independent living facility who were identified as making consistently poor dietary choices and who had medical conditions that necessitated changes in their eating habits. All 3 participants demonstrated a marked increase in healthy choices of food items in response to the package of enhanced prompts, feedback, and social reinforcement. No additional increase occurred with the introduction of the lottery and serving as a confederate. Food-choice data indicated that most of these improvements could be attributed to healthier entree and dessert choices. Group data for all residents suggested small improvements in dietary practices during the three intervention conditions, with the largest proportion of the group's healthy choices occurring when the lottery was added to enhanced prompts, feedback, and social reinforcement. Food-choice data indicated that most of these improvements could be attributed to healthier dessert choices alone.

3488634|t|The distribution of Ia antigen in the lesions of rat acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.
3488634|a|Ia antigen, encoded within the major histocompatibility complex, plays an important role in the activation of T lymphocytes. Since experimental allergic encephalitis is an essentially T cell-mediated disease, Ia antigen in the central nervous system (CNS) may be pathogenetically relevant. The occurrence of Ia antigen in the CNS of normal rats and of rats with experimental allergic encephalitis was studied by light and electron microscope immunocytochemistry using the monoclonal anti-Ia antibodies Ox 4 and Ox 6. In normal, unsensitized animals a district population of stellate cells in the meninges and some perivascular mononuclear cells in the nervous tissue carried Ia antigen. In rats with experimental allergic encephalitis a dramatic increase of Ia-positive cells was found. In addition to the positive cells found in normal animals, monocytes, macrophages and many lymphocytes in the meningeal perivascular and parenchymal inflammatory infiltrates as well as "activated microglia" stained for Ia antigen. We did not find evidence for Ia expression on endothelial cells, astrocytes or other components of the CNS in either normal or diseased rats.

14715446|t|Cell culture protection and in vivo neuroprotective capacity of flavonoids.
14715446|a|Flavonoids are an important group of recognized antioxidants ubiquitous in fruits, vegetables and herbs. There are epidemiological evidences for the stroke-protecting capacity of flavonoids and while the neuroprotective power of complex extracts rich in flavonoids like those of Ginkgo biloba, green tea or lyophilized red wine have been demonstrated in several studies, neuroprotection by individual flavonoids has been poorly studied in vivo. The neuroprotective capacity of individual flavonoids was studied in PC12 cells in culture and in a model of permanent focal ischemia (permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion - pMCAO). In the in vivo experiments, flavonoids were administered in lecithin preparations to facilitate the crossing of the blood brain barrier. The simultaneous incubation of PC12 cells with 200 micro M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and different flavonoids for 30 min resulted in a conspicuous profile: quercetin, fisetin, luteolin and myricetin significantly increased cell survival while catechin, kaempherol and taxifolin did not. Quercetin was detected in brain tissue 30 min and 1 h after intraperitoneal administration. When one of the protective flavonoids (quercetin) and one of those that failed to increase PC12 cell survival (catechin) were assessed for their protective capacity in the pMCAO model, administered i.p. 30 min after vessel occlusion, quercetin significantly decreased the brain ischemic lesion while catechin did not. It is concluded that when administered in liposomal preparations, flavonoids structurally related to quercetin could become leads for the development of a new generation of molecules to be clinically effective in human brain ischemia.

8163771|t|Prenatal gender preference of mothers of feminine and masculine boys: relation to sibling sex composition and birth order.
8163771|a|A mother's (prenatal) wish for a girl has, at times, been implicated as an etiological factor for boyhood femininity or its DSM-III-R diagnostic equivalent, the Gender Identity Disorder of Childhood. In one sample of 52 feminine and 52 nonclinical control boys from Los Angeles, the proportion of mothers who recalled a wish for a girl during the pregnancy did not differ significantly between groups (26.9% vs. 19.2%, respectively); however, in both groups, the maternal wish for a girl was significantly more common in sibships in which all of the proband's older siblings were male. In a second sample of 103 feminine boys from Toronto, the maternal wish for a girl was significantly higher than that found in the Los Angeles sample (43.7% vs. 26.9%), but a control group was not available; as in the Los Angeles sample, the maternal wish for a girl was significantly more common in sibships in which all of the proband's older siblings were male. Implications of these findings for further study of maternal influences on boyhood femininity are discussed.

16915692|t|Optimization of L-(+)-lactic acid production using pelletized filamentous Rhizopus oryzae NRRL 395.
16915692|a|Lactic acid is used as a food additive for flavor and preservation and a precursor in the development of poly-lactic acid, a product used to make biodegradable plastics and textiles. Rhizopus oryzae NRRL 395 is known to be a strain that produces optically pure L-(+)-lactic acid. The morphology of Rhizopus cultures is complex, forming filamentous, clumps, and pellet mycelia. Different morphology growth has significant effects on lactic acid production. In bioreactors, the filamentous or clump mycelia increase the viscosity of the medium, wrap around impellers, and block the nutrient transportation, leading to a decrease in production efficiency and bioreactor performance. Growing fungi in pellet form can significantly improve these problems. In this study, factors that affect lactic acid production in pelletized flask cultures using R. oryzae NRRL 395 were investigated in detail. Completely randomized designs were used to determine the influence of culture temperature, time, concentration of glucose, and inoculum size. Lactic acid fermentation using clump and pellet morphologies were performed in a 5 L fermentor at the optimal values obtained from flask culture. Finally, fed-batch culture was used to enhance the lactate concentration in broth. The final lactate concentration of fed-batch culture reached 92 g/L. The data presented in the article can provide useful information on optimizing lactic acid production using alternative source materials.

11448954|t|Differential involvement of the hyaluronan (HA) receptors CD44 and receptor for HA-mediated motility in endothelial cell function and angiogenesis.
11448954|a|Hyaluronan (HA), an important glycosaminoglycan constituent of the extracellular matrix, has been implicated in angiogenesis. It appears to exert its biological effects through binding interactions with at least two cell surface receptors: CD44 and receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM). Recent in vitro studies have suggested potential roles for these two molecules in various aspects of endothelial function. However, the relative contribution of each receptor to endothelial functions critical to angiogenesis and their roles in vivo have not been established. We therefore investigated the endothelial expression of these proteins and determined the effects of antibodies against RHAMM and CD44 on endothelial cell (EC) function and in vivo angiogenesis. Both receptors were detected on vascular endothelium in situ, and on the surface of cultured EC. Further studies with active blocking antibodies revealed that anti-CD44 but not anti-RHAMM antibody inhibited EC adhesion to HA and EC proliferation, whereas anti-RHAMM but not CD44 antibody blocked EC migration through the basement membrane substrate, Matrigel. Although antibodies against both receptor inhibited in vitro endothelial tube formation, only the anti-RHAMM antibody blocked basic fibroblast growth factor-induced neovascularization in mice. These data suggest that RHAMM and CD44, through interactions with their ligands, are both important to processes required for the formation of new blood vessels.

11991512|t|Invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast associated with Poland's syndrome: report of a case.
11991512|a|We report herein a rare case of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast associated with Poland's syndrome. The patient was a 59-year-old woman who was referred to our department after a nodule had been found in the upper outer portion of the left breast by a breast cancer screening program. On physical examination, marked hypoplasia of the right breast and upper limb was noted. Preoperative computed tomography also revealed a defect in the right pectoralis muscles. A quadrantectomy of the left breast with lymphadenectomy was subsequently performed and pathological examination of the resected specimen showed invasive ductal carcinoma. Her medical history revealed that her mother had attempted to abort the pregnancy around the fifth week of her gestation. The present case suggests that such an event during gestational development may be associated with congenital anomalies predisposing to malignant disorders.

15895406|t|Left ventricular unloading and concomitant total cardiac output increase by the use of percutaneous Impella Recover LP 2.5 assist device during high-risk coronary intervention.
15895406|a|A number of techniques have been proposed for circulatory support during high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), but no single approach has achieved wide acceptance so far. We report on a patient with severe left ventricular (LV) impairment who underwent a PCI with the use of a new left ventricular assist device, the Impella Recover LP 2.5 system. The effects on global cardiac output were determined by thermodilution (TD) and LV pressure-volume loops obtained by conductance catheter. The activation of the pump resulted in a rapid and sustained unloading effect of the LV. At the same time, the continuous expulsion of blood into ascending aorta throughout the cardiac cycle produced by the pump resulted in an increase of systemic overall CO, measured by the TD technique, of 1.43 L/min. The procedure was uncomplicated and the patient remained uneventful at follow-up. Our single experience gives new input for future trials to assess the effect of the Impella Recover LP 2.5 assist device on outcome in this subset of patients.

7514546|t|Identification of an aprotinin antiviral domain.
7514546|a|Digestion of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin, by clostripain, a cysteine proteinase, yielded five oligopeptide fragments. Two fragments exhibited both antiviral and antibacterial activities, two fragments only antiviral activity, and one fragment showed no antimicrobial activity. One of the former oligopeptides showed antiviral activity against human herpes simplex virus type 1 and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3. It consisted of the hexapeptide Y-F-Y-N-A-K corresponding to amino acids 21-26 of intact aprotinin. An identical synthetic peptide had the same antiviral spectrum as the natural hexapeptide, exhibited no antibacterial activity, and was also devoid of trypsin inhibiting activity. Intact aprotinin, in contrast, is ineffective against human herpes simplex virus 1 and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 but possesses antibacterial properties against several bacterial species [(1992) J. Appl. Bact. 72, 180-187].

11792814|t|Nesprins: a novel family of spectrin-repeat-containing proteins that localize to the nuclear membrane in multiple tissues.
11792814|a|In search of vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation markers, we identified two genes encoding members of a new family of type II integral membrane proteins. Both are ubiquitously expressed, and tissue-specific alternative mRNA initiation and splicing generate at least two major isoforms of each protein, with the smaller isoforms being truncated at the N-terminus. We have named these proteins nesprin-1 and -2 for nuclear envelope spectrin repeat, as they are characterized by the presence of multiple, clustered spectrin repeats, bipartite nuclear localization sequences and a conserved C-terminal, single transmembrane domain. Transient transfection of EGFP-fusion expression constructs demonstrated their localization to the nuclear membrane with a novel C-terminal, TM-domain-containing sequence essential for perinuclear localization. Using antibodies to nesprin-1, we documented its colocalization with LAP1, emerin and lamins at the nuclear envelope, and immunogold labeling confirmed its presence at the nuclear envelope and in the nucleus where it colocalized with heterochromatin. Nesprin-1 is developmentally regulated in both smooth and skeletal muscle and is re-localized from the nuclear envelope to the nucleus and cytoplasm during C2C12 myoblast differentiation. These data and structural analogies with other proteins suggest that nesprins may function as 'dystrophins of the nucleus' to maintain nuclear organization and structural integrity.

7545848|t|[Telemetry during swimming in risk evaluation of heart patients in rehabilitation]
7545848|a|Swimming differs from other forms of exercise due to its additional hydrostatic and thermal burden. It was investigated whether additional pathologic findings in comparison to history and standard exercise tests can be obtained by holter monitoring during swimming. Symptoms and exercise electrocardiogram were compared with the holter ECG during swimming in 125 patients divided into 3 groups with different diagnoses and severity of cardiac diseases. In a considerable percentage of patients ischemic changes and severe rhythm disturbances were found only during swimming with further diagnostic and therapeutic consequences, though patients with moderate and severe angina and with significant ischemic signs in the exercise test were excluded and mainly patients with slight or absent symptoms were evaluated predominantly. Thus, since swimming is a favorite leisure-time occupation also in patients with diseases of heart and circulation, holter monitoring during swimming is of diagnostic importance in the rehabilitation of these patients.

6158454|t|Differential reactivity of isolated mast cells from the rat and guinea pig.
6158454|a|The effects of various chemical histamine liberators on isolated rat peritoneal, rat mesenteric and guinea-pig mesenteric mast cells were examined. All three cell types responded, but to different degrees, to calcium ionophores and surface active agents. The rat mesenteric cells also reponded, but less effectively than the peritoneal cells, to compound 48/80, peptide 401 from bee venom and ATP. Rat mesenteric cells were essentially refractory to the action of dextran and guinea-pig cells were almost totally unresponsive to the named secretagogues. These results show that there are marked functional differences between the mast cells examined and suggest that isolated tissue cells may usefuly complement rat peritoneal cells in the study of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions.

9361872|a|Among 85 substance abusing or dependent inpatients, it was found that those with histories of distressing traumatic events reported more self-mutilative acts, higher levels of dissociation, and a greater degree of impulsivity than did patients without such histories. Implications of the findings for research and clinical practice are discussed.

19240813|t|Rich pickings near large communal roosts favor 'gang' foraging by juvenile common ravens, Corvus corax.
19240813|a|Ravens (Corvus corax) feed primarily on rich but ephemeral carcasses of large animals, which are usually defended by territorial pairs of adults. Non-breeding juveniles forage socially and aggregate in communal winter roosts, and these appear to function as 'information centers' regarding the location of the rare food bonanzas: individuals search independently of one another and pool their effort by recruiting each other at roosts. However, at a large raven roost in Newborough on Anglesey, North Wales, some juveniles have been observed recently to forage in 'gangs' and to roost separately from other birds. Here we adapt a general model of juvenile common raven foraging behavior where, in addition to the typical co-operative foraging strategy, such gang foraging behavior could be evolutionarily stable near winter raven roosts. We refocus the model on the conditions under which this newly documented, yet theoretically anticipated, gang-based foraging has been observed. In the process, we show formally how the trade off between search efficiency and social opportunity can account for the existence of the alternative social foraging tactics that have been observed in this species. This work serves to highlight a number of fruitful avenues for future research, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

11411767|t|Vasoregulatory function of the heme-heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide system.
11411767|a|Arterial vessels express one or more heme oxygenase (HO) isoenzymes that catalyze the metabolism of heme to carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin. Carbon monoxide promotes vasorelaxation through mechanisms that, depending on the vessels, involve activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, stimulation of calcium-activated potassium channels, or diminished synthesis of constrictor mediators, such as, endothelin and 20-HETE. Inhibitors of HO elicit vasoconstriction in vivo and in isolated pressurized arterioles. Inhibitors of HO also enhance myogenic vasoconstriction, as well as the constriction induced by phenylephrine in several vessels. The blood pressure of awake rats is increased by acute treatment with HO inhibitors, a response that is accompanied by attenuation of baroreflex activity. All in all, it would appear that a product of HO activity manufactured by arterial vessels, presumably CO, promotes vasodilation and decreases the reactivity of vascular smooth muscle to myogenic stimuli and constrictor agonists. In doing so, CO of vascular origin may contribute to the implementation of antihypertensive mechanisms. Carbon monoxide produced in central nervous system structures, for example, the nucleus tractus solitarii, also appears to support a blood pressure-lowering mechanism linked to inhibitory modulation of baroreceptor reflex activity.

11382842|t|Kinetics of permeation and metabolism of alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopheryl acetate in micro-Yucatan pig sin.
11382842|a|The objective of this research was to investigate the permeation and metabolism of alpha-tocopheryl acetate (alpha-TAc) and alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) from solution and emulsion formulations and to delineate the kinetics of such metabolism. Simple formulations containing alpha-TAc and alpha-T were applied to fresh, viable micro-Yucatan skin dermatomed to a thickness of 250-300 microns, as a finite dose in a flow-through diffusion system. The experiments were stopped at time intervals of 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours. At the end of each time interval, the amounts removed by washing, retained in the stratum corneum (SC), and penetrated into the viable skin and receptor were determined by a validated HPLC method. Receptor concentrations were below the limit of detection. alpha-TAc underwent metabolism in pig skin to the active antioxidant alpha-T. The metabolite appeared as early as two hours after application. The extent of metabolism was highest at 6-12 hours after application. No metabolism was detected in the stratum corneum. Delivery of alpha-T from isopropyl myristate (IPM) solution was more efficient than utilization of alpha-TAc from the same solution. Approximately 1.5% of alpha-T yielded the same viable skin concentration as 5% alpha-TAc. Topical application of alpha-tocopherol or its prodrug acetate was capable of enhancing the overall antioxidant capacity of pig skin. The hydrolytic pathway of alpha-TAc leading to the active antioxidant alpha-T could possibly be saturable.

17101075|t|Unusual clinical cases that mimic MS.
17101075|a|Diseases which are associated with relapses and disability accumulation that mimic MS may be effectively treated if they are appropriately diagnosed. Unfortunately, however, it can be easy to assume that a patient is presenting with unusual symptoms of MS rather than establish unequivocally that there is no other cause. This article illustrates five short cases from a selection presented at the MS Forum Interactive Symposium at the LACTRIMS Congress, Brazil, 2004. These cases feature the differential diagnosis of MS and illustrate the importance of early and accurate diagnosis. Each case has clinical features suggestive of MS, together with diagnostic findings that are discordant with this disease. Clinical features that can easily be interpreted as unusual MS presentations, but which indicate the need to undertake additional investigation, are included.

9114015|t|Transcriptional coactivator cAMP response element binding protein mediates induction of the human proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter by the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein.
9114015|a|The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a crucial component of eukaryotic cell cycle and DNA replication complexes, is induced by the adenovirus E1A 243R oncoprotein through a cis-acting element termed the PERE (PCNA-E1A responsive element). The PERE contains a sequence homologous to an activating transcription factor (ATF) motif, and ATF-1 is a major component of PERE-protein complexes. We have identified a second PERE-binding protein, the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor, which forms heterodimers with ATF-1 at this site. CREB, but not ATF-1, is able to mediate transactivation of a minimal PCNA-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter by E1A 243R. Further analysis revealed that the transcriptional coactivator, the CREB-binding protein (CBP), associates with PERE-related complexes, and that CBP is able to mediate a strong transactivation response to E1A 243R at the PCNA promoter. Experiments conducted with mutants in the E1A or CREB components support a model whereby E1A 243R transactivates the PCNA promoter via a CBP-CREB-PERE pathway. These findings delineate a paradigm by which E1A 243R can target and transactivate specific DNA promoter sequences.

3543358|t|Pepstatin analogues as novel renin inhibitors.
3543358|a|Pepstatin analogues corresponding to the general formula A-X-Y-Sta-Ala-Sta-R were synthesized in solution phase. Various changes in the nature of the A, X, and Y groups were made to improve the inhibitory potency against human plasma renin activity. The results were interpreted by use of the active-site model based on the sequence of human angiotensinogen. The tert-butyloxycarbonyl group and the isovaleryl group were found to be the most effective acyl groups (A). The analogues having a Phe residue in place of Val1 (X) and His or amino acid with an aliphatic side chain such as norleucine or norvaline in the Y position showed the highest inhibition of human plasma renin activity with IC50 values of about 10(-8)M. Esterification or amidification of the carboxyl group of the C-terminal statine did not change the inhibitory potency. The selectivity for rat, dog, pig, and monkey plasma renin of the most interesting compounds was studied.

10234987|t|Surgical treatment for ruptured vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms.
10234987|a|We analyze 20 cases of ruptured vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms and discuss the best choices for the surgical procedure. The preoperative Hunt and Kosnik grade was I in nine cases, Ia in four cases, II in three cases, III in three cases, and IV in one case. Rebleeding occurred in six cases, in four cases within 24 hours after the initial bleeding, and in every case within 6 days. In two cases surgery was performed within 3 days after the initial bleeding, in two cases within 4 to 7 days, in 16 cases after more than 7 days. A total of 22 operations were performed in the 20 patients (coating in 12, trapping in 6, proximal clipping of the vertebral artery in 2, clipping of the bleeding point in 2). A case of proximal clipping rebled 32 days after the operation and subsequently died. Both cases of clipping of the bleeding point were reoperated because of rebleeding and a slipped clip, respectively. All cases in which trapping or coating was performed resulted in a good outcome. Trapping is the most reliable method of preventing rebleeding. Coating or proximal clipping is an optional procedure, but cannot always prevent rebleeding because of the continuing circulation.

10214964|t|Identification of the sequence responsible for the nuclear localization of human Cdc6.
10214964|a|The Cdc6 is the essential protein for the initiation of DNA replication. Cdc6 is localized in the G1 nucleus, and abnormal nuclear localization of this protein induces irregular initiation of DNA replication. We identified here that amino acids K57 and R58 in the human Cdc6 protein play an important role in the nuclear localization of the protein. The fundamental features of the mechanism regulating the localization of Cdc6 seem to be maintained in yeast, Xenopus, and human, since the amino acid sequence surrounding K57 and R58, (S/T)PXKR(L/I), is conserved in these species. Substitution of amino acid residue S54 with E and not Q blocked partially the nuclear localization of the protein, implying that the phosphorylation at S54 is involved in the regulating mechanism of the cell cycle-dependent localization of Cdc6.

3939136|t|Doxorubicin-dependent lipid peroxidation at low partial pressures of O2.
3939136|a|Doxorubicin semiquinone, produced by reduction of doxorubicin with xanthine oxidase or ferredoxin reductase, reacted with H2O2 to cause deoxyribose oxidation that was catalysed by sub-micromolar concentrations of complexed iron. Both the mechanism of deoxyribose oxidation and the yield of oxidation products depended on the chelator. With EDTA or diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA), the reactive species behaved like free . OH. However, when ADP or no chelator was present, oxidation of deoxyribose was inhibited by mannitol but not benzoate or formate and was apparently not due to free . OH. Doxorubicin semiquinone and H2O2 caused peroxidation of phospholipid liposomes when ADP or no chelator was present, but not in the presence of EDTA or DTPA. Lipid peroxidation was iron dependent over a 0.1 to 1 microM range and was maximal with a pO2 of approximately 1.5 mm Hg, when the inhibitory effect of O2 on initiation is balanced by its stimulatory effects on propagation. The results imply that H2O2 and the doxorubicin semiquinone at low iron and O2 concentrations are very effective at initiating lipid peroxidation.

11471074|t|Presence of HLA-DR immunopositive cells in human fetal thymus.
11471074|a|Several kinds of thymic cells express MHC class II antigens, including human-leukocyte-associated antigen-DR (HLA-DR) during postnatal development. The present study was focused on the detection and analysis of HLA-DR immunoreactivity in human fetal thymuses (6-7th month of gestation). Using monoclonal antibodies, indirect immunoperoxidase staining (IIP), immunogold electron microscopy (IGEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry, HLA-DR immunopositive (IP) thymic cells were found in samples studied. IIP and IGEM demonstrated the presence of HLA-DR IP stromal cells (SCs): epithelial cells (ECs), dendritic-like cells (DCs) and macrophages (MCs) as well as HLA-DR IP lymphocytes (Lys) in all thymic regions. HLA-DR immunoreactivity was more prominent in the medullary ECs (mECs) than in the cortical ECs (cECs). Strong staining of Hassall's corpuscles and the adjacent mECs was seen. The differences in the intracellular distribution of HLA-DR molecules were detailed by IGEM as a first attempt to analyse HLA-DR IP cells at ultrastructural level. ELISA data and two-colour flow cytometric analysis revealed the presence of HLA-DR IP and HLA-DR/CD3 double IP Lys in accordance with the immunocytochemical assays. The results presented enrich the information about HLA-DR IP components of the thymic microenvironment in developing human thymus and raise the question of their role during prenatal T cell differentiation and selection processes.

9492638|t|[Compartment syndrome. Exclusively the result of increased pressure in the muscular compartment?]
9492638|a|The compartment syndrome (cs) is characterized by an increased tissue pressure in a limited space. Pathophysiologically, it is a multifactorial disease that is potentially induced by an initial trauma and develops according to the existence of cofactors. Cofactors are, for instance, the circulation of the patient and the initial treatment of the impending cs. In particular, the microcirculation is altered with endothelial destruction, development of a capillary leak, protein loss from intravasal space and the development of an interstitial and intracellular third space. An impaired drainage of the lymphatic and venous system causes a venous infarction. An arterial infarction results if the tissue pressure exceeds the arteriolar pressure. An accompanying ischemia reperfusion mechanism increases the trauma load. In disadvantageous cases, the patients are in danger of developing a multi-organ deficiency syndrome (MODS) by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction, by intravasal volume loss and by a myonephropathic systemic reaction. Clinically, the patients suffer a disproportionate amount of pain, followed by neurological signs. Especially in noncompliant patients, tissue pressure measurement is useful. Resuscitation of the circulation as well as splitting of casts is important. In case of a manifest cs, dermatofasciotomy has to be performed as an emergency operation. Even if cs is diagnosed early and fasciotomy is carried out early, the development of sequellae cannot be avoided in every single case.

16251317|t|Maraviroc (UK-427,857), a potent, orally bioavailable, and selective small-molecule inhibitor of chemokine receptor CCR5 with broad-spectrum anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 activity.
16251317|a|Maraviroc (UK-427,857) is a selective CCR5 antagonist with potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity and favorable pharmacological properties. Maraviroc is the product of a medicinal chemistry effort initiated following identification of an imidazopyridine CCR5 ligand from a high-throughput screen of the Pfizer compound file. Maraviroc demonstrated potent antiviral activity against all CCR5-tropic HIV-1 viruses tested, including 43 primary isolates from various clades and diverse geographic origin (geometric mean 90% inhibitory concentration of 2.0 nM). Maraviroc was active against 200 clinically derived HIV-1 envelope-recombinant pseudoviruses, 100 of which were derived from viruses resistant to existing drug classes. There was little difference in the sensitivity of the 200 viruses to maraviroc, as illustrated by the biological cutoff in this assay (= geometric mean plus two standard deviations [SD] of 1.7-fold). The mechanism of action of maraviroc was established using cell-based assays, where it blocked binding of viral envelope, gp120, to CCR5 to prevent the membrane fusion events necessary for viral entry. Maraviroc did not affect CCR5 cell surface levels or associated intracellular signaling, confirming it as a functional antagonist of CCR5. Maraviroc has no detectable in vitro cytotoxicity and is highly selective for CCR5, as confirmed against a wide range of receptors and enzymes, including the hERG ion channel (50% inhibitory concentration, >10 microM), indicating potential for an excellent clinical safety profile. Studies in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models predicted maraviroc to have human pharmacokinetics consistent with once- or twice-daily dosing following oral administration. Clinical trials are ongoing to further investigate the potential of using maraviroc for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and AIDS.

2454650|t|Genetic amniocentesis in twin pregnancies.
2454650|a|Eighty-three patients with twin pregnancies were seen at the University Hospital of Rotterdam between 1 January 1980 and 31 August 1985 for prenatal genetic studies. No abnormal karyotypes were found. Amniotic fluid was successfully obtained from both amniotic sacs in 77 patients. In two pregnancies elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were found in both sacs. One of these pregnancies was terminated and the other continued until term. One pregnancy miscarried 4 weeks after amniocentesis at 19 weeks gestation; three women were delivered between 23 and 28 weeks, 36 at between 28 and 37 weeks and 42 women after 37 weeks. The perinatal mortality rate was 55/1000 (9 of 164). These results show that genetic amniocentesis is a safe and reliable technique in twin pregnancy but the interpretation of elevated AFP levels is complicated by the fact that AFP diffuses across the amniotic membranes between the two sacs.

11874023|t|Geography and geographic information systems in family medicine research.
11874023|a|Understanding spatial relationships between determinants and outcomes of health care is important as the concept of population-based health care gains acceptance. A wide range of tools for understanding these spatial relationships is available to the family medicine researcher through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The power of GIS lies in its ability to display the spatial distribution of a health-related predictor or outcome. These maps can then be used to either generate or test hypotheses that would not have otherwise occurred to the investigator without visualizing the spatial relationships. The type of GIS application used is dependent on the type of data the researcher has and the research question. The three most common types of data are point or event data, lattice data, and geostatistical data. Point or event data can be displayed using a technique known as geocoding. Lattice data is most commonly displayed as shaded or colored areas where the shading represents rates or counts. Geostatistical data provides counts or numbers at a given location. The analytic techniques used for analyzing spatial data depend on the type of data. Maps tell powerful stories and display relationships that may not be obvious using other techniques.

7275938|t|Mechanism of thiamine-induced respiratory deficiency in Saccharomyces carlsbergensis.
7275938|a|Cells of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 grown aerobically with added thiamine (1 microgram . ml-1) in a vitamin B6-free medium contained no detectable heme precursors, such as delta-aminolevulinate, coproporphyrin III, or protoporphyrin IX. The deficiency in heme precursors in the thiamine-grown cells was accompanied by previously reported phenomena, i.e., growth depression, vitamin B6 deficiency, and respiratory deficiency due to a marked decrease in the activities of heme-containing enzymes and cytochrome level (I. Nakamura et al., FEBS Lett. 62: 354-358, 1976). It has been reported that all of the effects of thiamine are abolished by adding pyridoxine to the medium. delta-Aminolevulinate was found to have quite similar effects to those of pyridoxine, except that growth was partially improved by delta-aminolevulinate, whereas it was fully restored by pyridoxine. Incubation of the thiamine-grown cells with delta-aminolevulinate resulted in the appearance of the heme precursors and the heme-containing enzymes. Consistent with the lowered amount of vitamin B6, the thiamine-grown cells had a lowered activity of delta-aminolevulinate synthase, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme. Not only the holoenzyme activity but also the apoenzyme activity was very low in these cells. These results indicate that the thiamine-induced vitamin B6 deficiency brings about the decrease in delta-aminolevulinate synthase activity, which leads to heme deficiency and therefore to respiratory deficiency.

19137514|a|Doped up: The incorporation of Zn(2+) dopants in tetrahedral sites leads to the successful magnetism tuning of spinel metal ferrite nanoparticles (see picture). (Zn(0.4)Mn(0.6))Fe(2)O(4) nanoparticles exhibit the highest magnetization value among the metal ferrite nanoparticles. Such high magnetism results in the largest MRI contrast effects (r2=860 mm(-1) s(-1)) reported to date and also huge hyperthermic effects.

9849479|t|Clinical evaluation of autoantibodies to p53 protein in patients with chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.
9849479|a|In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of patients from the Western hemisphere, mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene are present in up to 37% of cases. Conformational change and cellular accumulation can initiate an immune response with generation of circulating autoantibodies to p53 protein. In the present study, we investigated 711 consecutive patients with chronic liver disease to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of autoantibodies to p53 protein as a serological marker for HCC. Detection of p53 autoantibodies was performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with immobilised recombinant p53 protein. Liver cirrhosis was present in 259 patients (36.4%) and a HCC was diagnosed in 75 patients (10.6%). Autoantibodies to p53 protein were detectable in 15 of 377 patients with chronic liver disease (4.0%) and in 10 of 259 patients presenting with liver cirrhosis (3.9%). All 25 p53 autoantibody-positive/HCC-negative patients were carefully investigated and no underlying malignancy was clinically detected, suggesting that elevated p53 antibody levels may not exclusively be detectable in patients with malignant disease. In patients with clinically manifest HCC, p53 autoantibodies were detected in 17 of 75 cases, thus resulting in a sensitivity of 22.7% and a specificity of 96.1%. In contrast, assessment of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 69.3 and 91.8% (AFP > 20 ng/ml) and 53.3 and 99.1% (AFP > 100 ng/ml) for the detection of HCC, respectively. The data of the present study reveal that the presence of p53 autoantibodies in patients with chronic liver disease is not completely specific for HCC. Moreover, we obtained no direct evidence that p53 autoantibody formation precedes the clinical diagnosis of HCC. However, serological screening for HCC might be improved by combining AFP and p53 autoantibody assays.

16335935|t|Proteomic analysis of pancreatic ductal carcinoma cells after combined treatment with gemcitabine and trichostatin A.
16335935|a|The human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line T3M4 has been treated with two agents, gemcitabine (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine, a drug interfering with DNA synthesis) and trichostatin A (a drug interfering with histone acetylation), both separately and in association. The association of the two drugs showed a marked cooperative effect in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of the cells. In an effort to identify differentially expressed proteins in the different drug treatments, the proteomic expression has been studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis comparing untreated cells with cells treated with trichostatin A and/or gemcitabine. A total of 81 differentially expressed polypeptide chains have been visualized by setting a 2.5-fold threshold value. Of these, 56 were identified via MALDI-TOF and Q-TOF MS analyses. Most of the regulated proteins are involved in two major biological processes, namely apoptotic cell death and proliferation. Our results demonstrate that the level of activation/repression of the proteins involved in these processes correlates with the growth inhibition and the apoptotic response of the cells subjected to single or combined drug treatment.

16048495|t|Efficacy and response to intravenous anti-D immunoglobulin in chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
16048495|a|This review explored the effectiveness of anti-D in the management of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Of 16 patients, 14 non-splenectomized and two splenectomized, with chronic ITP received anti-D immunoglobulin at a dose of 50-75 mcg/kg. A total number of 100 doses anti-D were given. Fourteen patients had previous treatment with steroids, which was discontinued either because of unresponsiveness or unacceptably high maintenance doses. Two patients had no previous treatments with any modality. Anti-D was given as a short i.v. infusion whenever platelet count dropped below 30 x 10(9)/l or patient was haemorrhagic or preoperatively. Response was defined as an absolute platelet count >30 x 10(9)/l or an increment by > or =20 x 10(9)/l. Response was obtained in 14 patients with a response rate of 87%. Fifteen patients were not on any other form of treatment at the time of anti-D therapy and one patient had a concurrent steroid therapy. The improvement in platelet count lasted for more than 8 weeks post-57% of anti-D infusions. We report two patients with previous splenectomy for ITP who responded to anti-D therapy. The side-effects profile was very mild with no patients required red cell transfusion.

7151171|t|The nuclear matrix: three-dimensional architecture and protein composition.
7151171|a|The structural filament network of the nucleus is prepared while still connected to the cytoskeleton. The relatively gentle procedure removes about 98% of the DNA and at least 86% of the histones. The matrix is bounded by an outer nuclear lamina connected to the cytoskeletal framework, as well as the inner filaments. The filaments range in diameter from 3 to 22 nm, and are organized in a three-dimensional anastomosing network in which nucleoli are enmeshed. The nuclear matrix is separated from the cytoskeletal framework by a double detergent and then partitioned into a chromatin fraction and a matrix fraction by nuclease and high salt. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis shows that the proteins of the cytoskeleton, chromatin and nuclear matrix are very different. A major protein found in all fractions cofocuses with actin. Vimentin is largely associated with the nuclear matrix, probably as a corona external of filaments.

2632564|a|We describe clinical, radiological and pathological findings in a case of herpes zoster ophthalmicus who developed contralateral hemiplegia. The CT scan showed discrete infarction of the right internal capsule and the right carotid angiogram showed concentric narrowing of the supraclinoid portion of right internal carotid artery. Superficial temporal artery biopsy showed infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells without any granuloma formation or giant cells. The importance of trigemino-vascular connections in the pathogenesis of this complication of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and the role of temporal artery biopsy in the diagnosis of arteritis following herpes zoster are discussed.

11836848|t|Electrophysiological testing of dyslexia.
11836848|a|We enlarged our previous study (Kubova Z. et al. Physiol Res 1995;44:87-89) giving an evidence about magnocellular pathway involvement (delayed motion-onset visual evoked potentials (M-VEPs)) in 70% of dyslexic children. In the new group presented here, only 48% of 25 dyslexics displayed prolonged latencies of cortical responses to motion stimuli. However, there was no correlation of this defect with the used quantification of the reading skills (reading quotients). No significant EEG frequency spectrum changes were found. 10 subjects from the former group, who were re-examined 4 years after the previous study at the mean age of 14 years, exhibited significant shortening of the M-VEP latencies compared to the original values. Also in control subjects a distinct improvement in magnocellular pathway function was proved (in M-VEP re-examination after 4 years). These results document rather late maturation of the magnocellular pathway, which is evident mainly in dyslexic children. In both groups of dyslexics an effect of colour in moving stimuli was also tested to verify the reported effect of light wavelengths onto the magnocellular pathway function. However, no latency differences among grey, green, pink, yellow and blue stimuli were observed.

12760904|t|Copper deficiency increases iron absorption in the rat.
12760904|a|Release of iron from enterocytes and hepatocytes is thought to require the copper-dependent ferroxidase activity of hephaestin (Hp) and ceruloplasmin (Cp), respectively. In swine, copper deficiency (CD) impairs iron absorption, but whether this occurs in rats is unclear. By feeding a diet deficient in copper, CD was produced, as evidenced by the loss of copper-dependent plasma ferroxidase I activity, and in enterocytes, CD reduced copper levels and copper-dependent oxidase activity. Hematocrit was reduced, and liver iron was doubled. CD reduced duodenal mucosal iron and ferritin, whereas CD increased iron absorption. Duodenal mucosal DMT1-IRE and ferroportin1 expression remained constant with CD. When absorption in CD rats was compared with that seen normally and in iron-deficient anemic animals, strong correlations were found among mucosal iron, ferritin, and iron absorption, suggesting that the level of iron absorption was appropriate given that the erythroid and stores stimulators of iron absorption are opposed in CD. Because CD reduced the activity of Cp, as evidenced by copper-dependent plasma ferroxidase I activity and hepatocyte iron accumulation, but iron absorption increased, it is unlikely that the ferroxidase activity of Hp is important and suggests another function for this protein in the export of iron from the enterocyte during iron absorption. Also, the copper-dependent ferroxidase activity of Cp does not appear important for iron efflux from macrophages, because Kupffer cells of the liver and nonheme iron levels of the spleen were normal during copper deficiency, suggesting another role for Cp in these cells.

17679708|t|Counseling about proper use of motor vehicle occupant restraints and avoidance of alcohol use while driving: a systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
17679708|a|BACKGROUND: Motor vehicle-related injuries are the leading cause of death among children, adolescents, and young adults. PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence of the effectiveness of counseling people of any age in primary care settings about occupant restraints or alcohol-related driving to prevent injuries. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Traffic Research Information Service; published systematic evidence reviews; experts; and bibliographies of selected trials. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); controlled clinical trials (CCTs); or comparative observational research studies that evaluated behavioral counseling interventions feasible to conduct in primary care or referral from primary care. DATA EXTRACTION: Investigators abstracted data on study design, setting, patients, interventions, outcomes, and quality-related study details. DATA SYNTHESIS: Trials report that counseling to increase the use of child safety seats leads to increased short-term restraint use (7 CCTs, 6 RCTs). Interventions that included a demonstration of correct use or distribution of a free or reduced-cost child safety seat reported larger effects. Few trials described the effect of counseling children 4 to 8 years of age to use booster seats (1 RCT); counseling older children, adolescents, or adults to use seat belts (1 CCT, 2 RCTs); or counseling unselected primary care patients to reduce alcohol-related driving behaviors (no trials). LIMITATIONS: Most of the relevant trials were published before the widespread enactment of child safety seat legislation and had methodological flaws. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental effect of primary care counseling to increase the correct use of child safety seats in the current regulatory environment is not established. The effectiveness of primary care counseling to reduce alcohol-related driving has not been tested. Studies are needed.

15699663|t|Surgical correction of orbital and periorbital deformities using lamella and complex osteotomies in both orbital rim and wall.
15699663|a|PURPOSE: For dealing with the problems in orbital and periorbital deformities. METHODS: In orbital deformities such as hypertelorism, orbital dystopia, radiated orbit, and secondary deformities of traumatic orbit, the authors used lamella osteotomies of either orbital rim and wall or complex osteotomies in both adjacent orbital rims and walls with bicoronal incision and galea aponeurotica dissection. In most of the cases, the fragments of complex osteotomies were repositioned with rigid fixation. RESULTS: Best results with nearly normal orbital volumes, better contour of orbit and midface, and improved eyelids and vision were achieved in 44 cases. There were 5 cases of supraorbital osteotomy (intracranial routine), 8 cases of medial orbital osteotomy, 3 cases of inferior orbital osteotomy, and 28 cases of both lateral and inferior orbital osteotomy in the series. No complications occurred. Clinical measurement was achieved in both pre- and postoperative osteotomies. According to comparative recordings, such as cephalometric measurement of the interorbital distance, exophthalmic measurement with Hertel exophthalmometer, the angle between orbital horizontal level and bilateral tragus linkage, and the linear distance between lateral canthus and tragus, the gap difference between pre- and postoperative data were achieved. The orbital and midface appearance has improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Lamella and complex osteotomies of orbital rim and wall were proved to be save and effective for correction of most deformities of the orbital and periorbital region.

14723619|t|The four mouse IgG isotypes differ extensively in bactericidal and opsonophagocytic activity when reacting with the P1.16 epitope on the outer membrane PorA protein of Neisseria meningitidis.
14723619|a|Mouse monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) of the four IgG isotypes, all specific for the P1.16 epitope on the meningcoccal PorA protein, were tested for functional activities. The avidities of the antibodies, measured by NH4SCN elution in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, showed similar values for all the MoAbs. The serum bactericidal activity (SBA) defined as the lowest concentration of antibodies giving 50% reduction in the number of meningococcal colony-forming units using human serum as complement, showed a hierarchy of IgG3 >> IgG2b > IgG2a >> IgG1. For the opsonophagocytosis (OP), the hierarchy was IgG3 > IgG2b = IgG2a >> IgG1. OP was measured in flow cytometry using log-phase live meningococci as target cells, normal human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) as effector cells and human serum as a complement source. The mouse MoAbs were negative in OP when using human PMNs in the absence of complement. The results demonstrate the importance of choosing the right isotype of mouse MoAbs when using them to judge the potential vaccine importance of their corresponding antigen. If such MoAbs should be used for passive vaccination against infectious diseases, the isotype would presumably play an important role for their anticipated clinical effects.

2790232|t|Psychological and immunological associations in men with AIDS pursuing a macrobiotic regimen as an alternative therapy: a pilot study.
2790232|a|A group of men with AIDS who chose to follow a macrobiotic regimen as an alternative form of therapy was studied for the possible influence of psychological factors on their clinical progression. In this group, men with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) had an estimated survival time of 60% at 3 years. Moreover, there was a tendency for lymphocyte number to increase during the first 3 years following diagnosis with KS. A subset of eight of these men with KS and one man with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) agreed to fill out a battery of psychological questionnaires. The results suggest low levels of fatigue, negative affect, and confusion, but high levels of vigor in this subgroup. Additionally, there was significant positive associations of CD4 positive lymphocyte numbers with trait curiosity and hardiness scores and significant negative associations with anxiety and depression. Mitogen responsiveness followed a similar pattern, but only a positive association with curiosity reached significance. Caution has to be used in interpreting such data, especially in view of the size of the sample and the complexity of the cohort. Nonetheless, these findings clearly suggest the need for prospective studies on the influence of psychological factors on the progression of AIDS.

8583512|t|Localization of mRNAs for adrenoleukodystrophy and the 70 kDa peroxisomal (PMP70) proteins in the rat brain during post-natal development.
8583512|a|Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a genetic demyelinating disorder caused by the mutation of a gene encoding a 75-kDa peroxisomal protein (ALDP) that belongs to the superfamily of ATP binding casette (ABC) transporters. The PMP 70 gene codes for another peroxisomal ABC transporter that shows 38.5% amino acid identity with ALDP. ALDP and PMP70 have the structure of half transporter and could possibly heterodimerize to form a full transporter within the peroxisomal membrane. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry in rat brain, we demonstrate that ALD and PMP70 mRNAs have different spatial and temporal expression during postnatal development. Whereas expression of PMP 70 mRNA was low at birth and culminates between the 2nd and 3rd week in hippocampus and cerebellum, maximum expression of ALDP was found at birth in all brain areas and decreased thereafter. The absence of coordinated expression of ALD and PMP70 genes suggests therefore that ALD and PMP70 proteins are unlikely to function as exclusive and obligatory partners in the brain.

2034455|t|Effect of preservatives in artificial tear solutions on tear film evaporation.
2034455|a|It has been suggested that certain preservatives in artificial tears may affect the stability of the tear film lipid layer. In the present study, tear film evaporation rate (TER) was measured with a modified Servomed Evaporimeter to determine whether preservatives affected tear stability. Two solution combinations were compared in a cross-over study of eight non-contact lens wearers. These combinations consisted of identical solutions, one preserved with either benzalkonium chloride (0.004%) or chlorobutanol (0.5%), the other non-preserved. Grouped data analysis showed no significant difference in TER with either solution combination. Individuals showed differences, but these were not related to the preservative. It is suggested that these concentrations of chlorbutanol and benzalkonium chloride did not affect the stability of the tear film lipid layer as indicated by an altered TER.

7297242|t|Modulation of 75S RNA synthesis in the Balbiani rings of Chironomus tentans with galactose treatment.
7297242|a|Galactose has been used as a tool to modify gene activity in the giant puffs Balbiani ring 2 (BR2) and Balbiani ring 1 (BR1) on chromosome IV in the salivary glands of Chironomus tentans. BR2 decreased gradually and was absent or almost absent after a four day galactose treatment. Concomitant with this morphological change, the labelling of the population of growing 75S RNA molecules in BR2 decreased, and was essentially abolished after four days in galactose. Since the elongation rate at the 75S RNA genes proved to be the same in the galactose treated glands as in the control glands, the decreased labelling in BR2 was likely to correspond to a decreased production of 75S RNA. No changes in the size distribution of the growing 75S RNA molecules were noted during the galactose treatment, suggesting that the modulation of the activity was most likely accomplished at the initiation level, but regulation of a very early premature termination could not be excluded. When galactose was removed from the medium, BR2 attained its normal size and its ordinary RNA labelling. BR1 was studied in parallel with BR2 and it behaved strikingly different: BR1 expanded during the galactose treatment and the amount of growing 75S RNA increased, indicating an enhanced production of this 75S RNA species. Also the modulation of BR1 RNA synthesis was reversible. During the galactose treatment no changes in the labelling of chromosome I-III and of nucleolar RNA were observed suggesting that during the four day treatment, galactose exerted its effect mainly on the synthesis of BR2 and BR1 transcription products. The significance of these observations are considered in relation to the information available on the synthesis of the corresponding secretory polypeptides and the formation of the tube-like burrows. We also discuss the implications of the results for models of the regulation of gene activity and of the puffing process.

7037952|t|Characterization of the human cellular immune response to purified group A streptococcal blastogen A1.
7037952|a|The human mononuclear cell response to purified extracellular streptococcal protein, blastogen A, was compared to the response of these cells to PHA and tetanus antigen. Blastogen A induced peak uptake of thymidine during day 6 of tissue culture whereas PHA induced peak uptake during day 5 and tetanus during day 8. Like PHA, blastogen A transformed human umbilical cord lymphocytes and those of nonimmune animals. Also like PHA, blastogen A transformed primarily T lymphocytes. However, unlike PHA, the ability of T lymphocytes to respond to blastogen A was almost completely dependent on the presence of viable non-T lymphocytes. Monocytes were not as effective in facilitating the response to blastogen A as they were for PHA. Thus, blastogen A behaves most like a polyclonal T lymphocyte mitogen, although the degree of dependence of the transformation response on the presence of non-T lymphocytes is much greater than that of PHA.

8179086|t|Treatment of sepsis by extracorporeal elimination of endotoxin using polymyxin B-immobilized fiber.
8179086|a|Despite the use of potent antibiotics and intensive supportive care, mortality remains high among septic shock patients, especially those with endotoxemia. To remove endotoxin directly from the blood, a material consisting of polymyxin B that is immobilized on fibers (PMX-F) and that can selectively detoxify endotoxin was developed. In a preliminary clinical study, 16 patients with septic multiple organ failure were treated with direct hemoperfusion using a PMX-F column. This therapy significantly decreased the endotoxin level from 76 pg/mL to 21 pg/mL after 2 hours of direct hemoperfusion. The hyperdynamic state of the cardiac index, which is a characteristic of endotoxic shock, returned to normal levels after treatment. In septic shock patients with a systolic pressure of less than 100 mm Hg, the systolic arterial pressure increased significantly from the pretreatment level. The alleviation of fever caused by this therapy continued until the day after treatment. Of the 16 patients who underwent this therapy, 9 were alive 2 weeks after this therapy and 7 patients were discharged from the hospital alive. Hemoperfusion with PMX may be an effective treatment for sepsis and septic shock.

15616700|t|Picosecond kinetics of excited-state charge separation in 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine.
15616700|a|4-(Dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) shows solvent-dependent dual fluorescence from the initially excited state B* and a highly polar TICT state A*. Room-temperature time-resolved picosecond fluorescence investigations prove the bimodal kinetics of the excited-state electron transfer reaction B*-->A* in polar aprotic media. In medium polarity solvents (such as ethyl acetate) two emitting states of DMAP are shown to reach equilibrium within 50 ps. Both emitting states originate from the same ground state. The rate of excited-state charge separation depends on polarity and proton donating ability of the surrounding medium. The effects of temperature on the quantum yields of both fluorescences of DMAP in polar aprotic media indicate the transition from the kinetic regime (at low temperatures) to the equilibrium regime (at high temperatures). The kinetic behaviour of the dual luminescence of DMAP in protic solvents is more complex than in aprotic ones. In alcohols an efficient nonradiative channel competes with excited-state charge separation.

10531492|a|Flavocetin-A (FL-A) is a platelet glycoprotein Ib-binding protein, a high molecular mass oligomer (149 kDa) of C-type lectin-like subunits alpha and beta isolated from the habu snake venom. Purified FL-A crystallized in the tetragonal space group I4 with unit-cell dimensions a = b = 121.0, c = 63.2 A. The crystals diffract to at least 2.4 A resolution. The structure has been solved by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of factors IX/X-binding protein (PDB code 1ixx) as a search model. The asymmetric unit contains one heterodimer, showing that FL-A is a novel tetradimer (alphabeta)(4) composed of four heterodimers related by a crystallographic fourfold axis.

18768144|t|The novel NTPDase inhibitor sodium polyoxotungstate (POM-1) inhibits ATP breakdown but also blocks central synaptic transmission, an action independent of NTPDase inhibition.
18768144|a|Understanding the mechanisms and properties of purinergic signalling would be greatly assisted by the discovery of subtype selective and potent inhibitors of the NTPDase enzymes, which metabolise nucleotides such as ATP and ADP in the extracellular space. Currently ARL 67156 is the best available NTPDase inhibitor, but its relatively poor efficacy means that negative results are difficult to interpret. POM-1 (sodium polyoxotungstate) is a novel NTPDase inhibitor, which has shown promising results with the inhibition of recombinant NTPDases 1, 2 and 3. We have tested the effectiveness and physiological effects of POM-1 with cerebellar and hippocampal slices. Using the malachite green phosphate assay, HPLC and biosensor measurements we have found that POM-1 is more effective at blocking ATP breakdown in cerebellar slices than ARL 67156. The site of inhibition is at the first step of the breakdown cascade (conversion of ATP to ADP) and the effects of POM-1 appear readily reversible. However, POM-1 has multiple effects on synaptic transmission. At the cerebellar parallel fibre-Purkinje cell (PF) synapse POM-1 produced a long lasting inhibition of transmission, which was preceded in a minority of synapses by a transient increase in PF excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude (approximately 20%). This increase in PF EPSP amplitude appears to result from a reduction in the tonic activation of presynaptic A1 receptors, consistent with POM-1 preventing the breakdown of ATP to adenosine. The reduction in PF EPSP amplitude does not however appear to result from NTPDase inhibition as it persists when both adenosine and ATP (P2Y and P2X) receptors are blocked. An increase in paired pulse ratio and a reduction in presynaptic volley amplitude suggest that there is a presynaptic component of POM-1 action which reduces glutamate release. POM-1 produced similar inhibition at climbing fibre synapses and at hippocampal CA1 pyramidal synapses. Thus although POM-1 is more effective than ARL 67156 at blocking ATP breakdown its usefulness is limited by off-target actions on synaptic transmission.

6350828|t|Trp repressor protein is capable of intruding into other amino acid biosynthetic systems.
6350828|a|Escherichia coli strains with elevated intracellular levels of Trp repressor protein displayed complete growth inhibition on minimal media which contained high levels of tryptophan. The inhibition was attributable to the acquisition of a compound nutritional requirement, which could be satisfied by a combination of isoleucine, leucine, valine, threonine, serine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. It is proposed that Trp repressor protein, at elevated levels, represses the transcription of those genes which encode enzymes for the biosynthesis of these particular amino acids. Data which support this model are presented, together with a discussion of its regulatory implications.

3130211|t|The development and testing of intravenous dosing regimens: application to flecainide for the suppression of ventricular arrhythmias.
3130211|a|A two-part pharmacokinetic approach was used to prospectively develop and test intravenous flecainide infusion regimens for the acute therapy for ventricular arrhythmias. Initially, each of nine known responders to oral flecainide was given a rapid flecainide infusion to characterize pharmacokinetic parameters and determine the minimum effective concentration for each patient. These data were used to calculate individually appropriate three-stage flecainide infusions of predetermined durations in eight patients. The three-stage infusions (0.15 +/- 0.02 mg flecainide acetate/kg/min for 5 minutes, 0.046 +/- 0.004 mg/kg/min for 60 minutes, and 0.31 +/- 0.05 mg/kg/hr for 5 to 47 hours; mean +/- SE) resulted in 95% +/- 0.1% suppression of ventricular ectopic depolarizations. Based on these results, six additional patients received a uniform infusion regimen (0.1 mg/kg/min for 5 minutes, 0.025 mg/kg/min for 2 hours, and 0.25 mg/kg/hr for 46 hours). Supplemental doses of 0.25 mg/kg were given (four doses per patient). With this protocol, ventricular ectopic depolarizations were 82.6% +/- 8.5% suppressed. Measured plasma flecainide concentrations were not significantly different from those predicted by pharmacokinetic models. A prompt and sustained antiarrhythmic effect was obtained with an intravenous regimen of flecainide determined by a prospective pharmacokinetic approach. However, the dosages developed in this study may have to be modified for patients with impaired cardiac or renal function.

19219750|t|Mechanisms of action of two different natural mixtures of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in ovarian follicles.
19219750|a|The present work investigated the effects of two different natural mixtures on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and oestrogen receptor (ER)beta protein levels, as well as on the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and CYP2B. Consequently, the authors observed the effects of these mixtures on gonadotropine-stimulated steroid secretion by ovarian follicles. The natural mixtures that were studied were 'Mjosa' extracted from burbot liver, which contains a high level of PBDEs, and 'Marine mix', extracted from Atlantic cod liver, which contains a high level of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Follicular cells were exposed in vitro to 'Marine mix' and 'Mjosa mix' at doses of 3.6 and 1.4 microg ml(-1), respectively. Media were collected and used for steroid analysis and cell viability assays. Cells were used to estimate aromatase activity (CYP19), AhR and ER protein levels, and CYP1A1 and CYP2B1 activity. Western blot analysis indicated down-regulation of AhR by 'Marine mix' and down-regulation of ERbeta by Mjosa mix. Up-regulation of CYP1A1 expression and activity were seen following treatment with Marine mix, but not Mjosa mix. Increased CYP2B1 activity was noted after treatment with both 'Marine mix' and Mjosa mix. Both mixtures increased luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated progesterone and testosterone secretion, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-stimulated oestradiol secretion, and CYP19 activity. These results suggest that: (1) 'Marine mix' is a mixed-type CYP inducer; (2) 'Mjosa mix' is an inducer of ERbeta and CYP2B; and (3) both 'Marine mix' and 'Mjosa mix' stimulate aromatase activity as a consequence of oestradiol secretion through activation of CYP19.

2617831|t|Trace element concentrations in perinatal beef calves from west central Nebraska.
2617831|a|Trace element analyses were performed on 144 livers from perinatal calves submitted to the Veterinary Science Laboratory, North Platte, NE. All calves originated from herds in west-central Nebraska and ranged in age from 8 months of gestation up to 6-week-old neonates. Calves were divided into 5 categories based on objectives gross examination and ocular fluid evaluation: abomasal ulcers, abomasal tympany, diarrhea, stillborn and excessive nitrate exposure. Excessive zinc concentrations were found in 4 of the 5 categories. Only in the abomasal ulcer category could a correlation be found; this category routinely was found to have deficient to low normal liver copper concentrations and highest liver molybdenum concentrations. Both excesses and deficiencies of selenium and iron occurred in all categories.

17245580|t|Potent activity of the lichen antibiotic (+)-usnic acid against clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
17245580|a|Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant staphylococci, most notably methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are serious clinical problems. The antibiotic arsenal available against them is limited, and new mutants worsen the situation. We studied the activity of (+)-usnic acid, an old lichen-derived drug, and its sodium salt against clinical isolates of VRE and MRSA using the agar diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. The acid and, especially, the sodium salt had potent antimicrobial activity against all clinical isolates of VRE and MRSA studied. The MIC values of the sodium salt against VRE strains ranged between 4 and 16 microg/ml (1-day test) and between 4 and 31 microg/ml (2-day test), being below 8 microg/ml for most strains. The salt had potent activity even against those strains that were not inhibited by ampicillin (125 microg/ml), and it never lost its activity after 24 h, in contrast to ampicillin. Thus, in spite of the fact that usnic acid can in some cases cause serious toxicity, it and its salts may be worth considering in clinical practice in cases where other therapies have failed or the microbe is resistant toward other agents.

7527533|t|Lendrum (-MSB) staining for fibrin identification in sealed skin grafts.
7527533|a|The significance and effect of fibrin sealant systems for woundhealing are still unknown, because of the use of insufficient, conventional staining methods for the demonstration of the fibrin components used by sealant systems. From 21 patients with extensive burns of 2nd and 3rd degree biopsies of the skin were obtained during consecutive operations to cover the defect of the skin with split-thickness skin grafting. In the present paper morphological results concerning the demonstration of fibrin components and morphological differences in woundhealing of sealed and unsealed skin grafts are presented using Lendrum (-MSB) staining. With this staining method it is possible to identify exogenous fibrin components of the sealant system and to differentiate between fresh and older fibrin components, due to colour changes depending on time.

9405059|t|Redox thermodynamics of the native and alkaline forms of eukaryotic and bacterial class I cytochromes c.
9405059|a|The reduction potentials of beef heart cytochrome c and cytochromes c2 from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and Rhodobacter capsulatus were measured through direct electrochemistry at a surface-modified gold electrode as a function of temperature in nonisothermal experiments carried out at neutral and alkaline pH values. The thermodynamic parameters for protein reduction (DeltaS degrees rc and DeltaH degrees rc) were determined for the native and alkaline conformers. Enthalpy and entropy terms underlying species-dependent differences in E degrees and pH- and temperature-induced E degrees changes for a given cytochrome were analyzed. The difference of about +0.1 V in E degrees between cytochromes c2 and the eukaryotic species can be separated into an enthalpic term (-DeltaDeltaH degrees rc/F) of +0.130 V and an entropic term (TDeltaDeltaS degrees rc/F) of -0.040 V. Hence, the higher potential of the bacterial species appears to be determined entirely by a greater enthalpic stabilization of the reduced state. Analogously, the much lower potential of the alkaline conformer(s) as compared to the native species is by far enthalpic in origin for both protein families, and is largely determined by the substitution of Met for Lys in axial heme ligation. Instead, the biphasic E degrees /temperature profile for the native cytochromes is due to a difference in reduction entropy between the conformers at low and high temperatures. Temperature-dependent 1H NMR experiments suggest that the temperature-induced transition also involves a change in orientation of the axial methionine ligand with respect to the heme plane.

10407461|t|Developmental components of resting ventilation among high- and low-altitude Andean children and adults.
10407461|a|This paper evaluates the age-associated changes of resting ventilation of 115 high- and low-altitude Aymara subjects, of whom 61 were from the rural Aymara village of Ventilla situated at an average altitude of 4,200 m and 54 from the rural village of Caranavi situated at an average altitude of 900 m. Comparison of the age patterns of resting ventilation suggests the following conclusions: 1) the resting ventilation (ml/kg/min) of high-altitude natives is markedly higher than that of low-altitude natives; 2) the age decline of ventilation is similar in both lowlanders and highlanders, but the starting point and therefore the age decline are much higher at high altitude; 3) the resting ventilation that characterizes high-altitude Andean natives is developmentally expressed in the same manner as it is at low altitude; and 4) the resting ventilation (ml/kg/min) of Aymara high-altitude natives is between 40-80% lower than that of Tibetans.

9778295|t|Th-2 type cytokine receptors in allergic rhinitis and in response to topical steroids.
9778295|a|OBJECTIVES: Th-2 type cytokine production (interleukin-4 [IL-4] and interleukin-5 [IL-5]) has been demonstrated to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis (AR), and the treatment of AR with topical corticosteroids has been shown to reduce the expression of Th-2 type cytokines in vivo. However, the contribution and expression of Th-2 type cytokine receptors in AR and their response to corticosteroid treatment remain to be clarified. Objectives of the current study are 1. To examine the expression of the cytokine IL-4 and IL-5 receptors (IL-4R and IL-5R) in a nasal allergen challenge model and to contrast this with the expression of the receptor for the Th-1 type cytokine, interferon-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR), and 2. to examine the effects of pretreatment with topical corticosteroid before allergen challenge on the expression of these same receptors. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized prospective study involving 14 ragweed-allergic subjects evenly divided between placebo and corticosteroid pretreatment. METHODS: Immunocytochemistry (alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase labeling [APAAP] technique) was used to stain nasal biopsy specimens before and after allergen challenge. Antibodies used included anti-CD3, CD4, CD8, MBP, IL-4R, IL-5R, and IFN-gammaR. RESULTS: Following allergen challenge, we observed a significant increase in the Th-2 type cytokine receptors (IL-4R and IL-5R; P < .05), as well as a significant decrease in the expression of the Th-1 type cytokine receptor (IFN-gammaR; P < .05). Pretreatment with topical corticosteroids before nasal allergen challenge resulted in decreased expression of IL-4R (P < .05) and IL-5R (P < .05) and increased expression of IFN-gammaR (P <.05). Further, IL-4R and IL-5R expression correlated with eosinophil infiltration in the tissues. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that in AR, cytokine receptors for IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-gamma follow a similar pattern to their ligands. In addition, pretreatment with topical corticosteroids was shown to alter the cytokine receptor expression pattern from a Th-2 profile more toward a Th-1 profile.

139276|t|Allergic contact response to vitamin A acid.
139276|a|Three patients treated daily with vitamin A acid cream experienced after one week, seven weeks and 14 weeks respectively sudden redness and itching at the treated sites. Patch testing with the cream (containing 0.05% vitamin A acid) and with vitamin A acid 0.05% in absolute alcohol produced strongly positive reactions in the patients but only slight erythema in some of the controls. Since patch testing with vitamin A acid 0.005% in absolute alcohol elicited no response in controls but positive reactions in the three patients, it is probable that these latter reactions were due to contact allergy. Histologically the test reaction showed intact epidermis and dense dermal infiltration by mononuclear cells, and thus resembled a response of the tuberculin type.

7308525|t|Fertility and ovum transport after microsurgical removal of the uterotubal junction in rabbits.
7308525|a|The role of the uterotubal junction (UTJ) in fertility and ovum transport was investigated following unilateral microsurgical resection of the UTJ in 15 rabbits. Fourteen animals became pregnant on the UTJ resected side and 14 on the control side following artificial insemination and induction of ovulation. Fifty-two of 61 ova (85.2%) became implanted on the control side, and 56 of 68 ova (82.3%) became implanted on the resected side. Ten days after delivery, artificial insemination and induction of ovulation were repeated. Ovum transport was examined at 60, 66, and 72 hours. There was no significant difference in ovum transport between UTJ resected and control sides. The distribution of ova within the oviduct and the time of their entrance into the uterus was comparable in both sides. These results indicate that the UTJ is not necessary for normal fertility and ovum transport in the rabbit.

27346|t|[Diethylpentenamide, a substitute for carbromal? (author's transl)]
27346|a|Bromcarbamide-containing sleeping pills are frequently used in suicide attempts and cause severe, often fatal, intoxication. Since 1975, the chemically related drug diethylpentenamide had been available (in the German Federal Republic) without prescription. The authors report four cases of attempted suicide with the drug. The signs were similar to those after carbromal intoxication. There was severe respiratory depression, successfully treated by extracorporeal detoxication with combined haemoperfusion and haemodialysis. One patient developed acute pancreatitis as a complication.

7143060|t|Prognosis of severe head injuries.
7143060|a|The authors have analyzed retrospectively a series of 288 consecutive patients with severe head injury observed between January, 1977, and May, 1980. Seventy-three patients were excluded as not being compatible with those of the International Data Bank. The remaining 215 patients complied with the definition of coma given by Jennett. All patients, after appropriate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, diagnostic measures, and, when required, surgical treatment, were managed in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit with endotracheal intubation, controlled hyperventilation, mild dehydration, dexamethasone in standard doses, and sedation. The mortality rate was 39.5%. Of the survivors, 59.2% made a good recovery, 18.4% remained moderately disabled, 6.1% were severely disabled, and 1.5% were in a persistent vegetative state. The most reliable predictive criteria were: absence of brain-stem reflexes, neurological status, abnormal motor patterns, arterial hypotension, and presence of mass lesions. It is concluded that no sign has an absolute prognostic value when considered independently of its time course.

The system is able to discriminate between different patterns presented as input, and also detect motion and measure its velocity.

7789947|a|Human chromosome 6 has been subdivided by chromosome microdissection into 14 unique regions. Following microdissection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of dissected DNA was performed using a universal primer to generate subregion-specific probes that provided complete coverage of chromosome 6. All 16 microdissections have been regionally assigned along chromosome 6 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using biotin-labeled dissected DNA hybridized to G-banded normal metaphase chromosomes. These probes can be used as region-specific paints to generate unique "bar codes" and for analysis of chromosome alterations involving chromosome 6 that are unidentifiable by conventional banding analysis.

6841214|t|Distribution of histamine receptors in isolated canine airways.
6841214|a|The distribution of histamine receptors was examined in isolated trachealis smooth muscle strips and helical strips of large (5 mm) and small (1.5 mm) intrapulmonary airways. All airways contracted in response to histamine, but the sensitivity to this agent was significantly greater in intrapulmonary airways than in trachealis strips. A dose-dependent tachyphylaxis to histamine occurred when airways were exposed repeatedly to 10(-4) M histamine but not to 5 X 10(-6) M histamine. The H1-agonist, 2-methylhistamine, also caused airway contractions, although they were less forceful than those caused by histamine. Both histamine- and 2-methylhistamine-induced contractions were blocked by the H1-antagonist, pyrilamine. The H2-agonists, 4-methylhistamine and dimaprit, as well as histamine in the presence of pyrilamine failed to relax both acetylcholine- and 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced contractions. Moreover, the H2-antagonist, metiamide, had no effect on histamine-induced contractions. We conclude that histamine H1-receptors are present in both extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary airways of the dog and cause contraction when stimulated. In contrast, histamine H2-receptor activity could not be demonstrated in the airways of this species.

19085966|t|Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Cdc42 results in delayed liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in mice.
19085966|a|Cdc42, a member of the Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) family, plays important roles in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, cell proliferation, cell polarity, and cellular transport, but little is known about its specific function in mammalian liver. We investigated the function of Cdc42 in regulating liver regeneration. Using a mouse model with liver-specific knockout of Cdc42 (Cdc42LK), we studied liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Histological analysis, immunostaining, and western blot analysis were performed to characterize Cdc42LK livers and to explore the role of Cdc42 in liver regeneration. In control mouse livers, Cdc42 became activated between 3 and 24 hours after partial hepatectomy. Loss of Cdc42 led to a significant delay of liver recovery after partial hepatectomy, which was associated with reduced and delayed DNA synthesis indicated by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine staining. Consistent with this, expression of cyclins D1, A, and E was markedly delayed or reduced in Cdc42LK livers during regeneration. As a potential effector of Cdc42, Rac1 activation was dramatically attenuated in Cdc42LK livers after partial hepatectomy, suggesting it is regulated in a Cdc42-dependent manner. Activation of certain proliferative signaling pathways, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p70S6 kinase pathways, was delayed in Cdc42LK livers. In addition, dilated bile canaliculi and excessive lipid accumulation were observed in mutant livers during liver regeneration, which may result from impaired cytoskeletal organization and intracellular trafficking in hepatocytes. Conclusion: Our results revealed important roles of Cdc42 in the regulation of proliferative signaling during liver regeneration.

12652556|t|An EM-based semi-parametric mixture model approach to the regression analysis of competing-risks data.
12652556|a|We consider a mixture model approach to the regression analysis of competing-risks data. Attention is focused on inference concerning the effects of factors on both the probability of occurrence and the hazard rate conditional on each of the failure types. These two quantities are specified in the mixture model using the logistic model and the proportional hazards model, respectively. We propose a semi-parametric mixture method to estimate the logistic and regression coefficients jointly, whereby the component-baseline hazard functions are completely unspecified. Estimation is based on maximum likelihood on the basis of the full likelihood, implemented via an expectation-conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm. Simulation studies are performed to compare the performance of the proposed semi-parametric method with a fully parametric mixture approach. The results show that when the component-baseline hazard is monotonic increasing, the semi-parametric and fully parametric mixture approaches are comparable for mildly and moderately censored samples. When the component-baseline hazard is not monotonic increasing, the semi-parametric method consistently provides less biased estimates than a fully parametric approach and is comparable in efficiency in the estimation of the parameters for all levels of censoring. The methods are illustrated using a real data set of prostate cancer patients treated with different dosages of the drug diethylstilbestrol.

12925179|t|A comparison of preoperative tramadol and morphine for the control of early postoperative pain in canine ovariohysterectomy.
12925179|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare morphine with tramadol for the management of early postoperative pain following ovariohysterectomy after pyometra in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized blinded clinical trial. ANIMALS: Thirty female dogs, 2-14 years old. METHODS: Animals were randomly divided into two equal groups. Group 1 received 0.2 mg kg-1 of morphine IV and group 2 received 2 mg kg-1 of tramadol IV after the induction of anesthesia. The dogs were premedicated with acepromazine, and anesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam and ketamine. Isoflurane was used for the maintenance of anesthesia. The variables measured were: analgesia; sedation; cardiac and respiratory rates; arterial blood pressure; end-tidal isoflurane and carbon dioxide (Pe'CO2); oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2); plasma catecholamines; serum cortisol and glucose concentrations; pH and blood gases. The animals were monitored for 6 hours after the administration of the analgesic agent. RESULTS: There were no differences between the two groups with regard to analgesia, sedation, SpO2, pH and blood gases, cardiovascular variables, glucose, catecholamine and cortisol concentrations. Forty minutes postopioid administration, the end-tidal isoflurane concentration was significantly lower in the morphine-treated group as compared to the tramadol group. At 30 minutes following opioid injection, Pe'CO2 was significantly higher in the morphine group than in the tramadol group. Two dogs in the tramadol group and one in the morphine group were given morphine postoperatively because of increasing pain scores. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Morphine and tramadol, administered preemptively can be used safely in dogs to control early pain after ovariohysterectomy without significant adverse effects.

8458324|t|Stably maintained microdomain of localized unrestrained supercoiling at a Drosophila heat shock gene locus.
8458324|a|A psoralen crosslinking assay was utilized to detect localized, unrestrained DNA supercoiling (torsional tension) in vivo in Drosophila chromosomal regions subject to differential transcriptional activity. By comparing rates of crosslinking in intact cells with those in cells where potential tension in chromosomal domains was relaxed by DNA strand nicking, the contribution to psoralen accessibility caused by altered DNA-protein interactions (e.g. nucleosomal perturbations) was distinguished from that due to the presence of unrestrained supercoiling in a region of interest. The heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) genes were wound with a significant level of superhelical tension that remained virtually unaltered whether or not the genes were transcriptionally activated by thermal elevation. Constitutively expressed 18S ribosomal RNA genes also exhibited unrestrained superhelical tension at a level comparable with that across hsp70. In contrast, flanking regions downstream of each of the divergent hsp70 genes at locus 87A7 exhibited substantially less tension. Thus the results point to the existence of stable, torsionally stressed topological domains within eukaryotic chromosomal DNA, suggesting that the relaxing action of topoisomerases is not ubiquitous throughout the nucleus but, in fact, is likely to be tightly regulated.

2159424|t|Secretion and intracellular degradation of collagen in cultures of normal and SV-40-transformed human fibroblasts.
2159424|a|With a pulse-chase technique, secretion and intracellular degradation of collagen were investigated in human cultured normal and SV-40-transformed fibroblasts. Normal cells at a proliferative phase of growth secreted collagen more actively than the stationary phase (resting) cells. Transformed fibroblasts secreted protein at a lower rate than both normal cell types. Resting and dividing normal cells displayed no differences in the rates of intracellular collagen degradation at the various stages of the chase period. Transformed cells did not differ from the normal ones in collagen degradation rates at the first hour of the chase period while at later times in the chase period, the total amount of degraded collagen was reduced by 20-30% in the transformed vs normal cultures. The data are discussed in the view of possible relations between the various mechanisms of intracellular transport and degradation of collagen.

11484064|t|Pharmacology of the thromboxane receptor antagonist and thromboxane synthase inhibitor BM-531.
11484064|a|BM-531 (N-tert-butyl-N'-[(2-cyclohexylamino-5-nitrobenzene)sulfonyl]urea), a torasemide derivative, is a novel noncarboxylic thromboxane receptor antagonist and thromboxane synthase inhibitor. Indeed, its affinity for human washed platelet TXA2 receptors labeled with [3H]SQ-29548 (IC50 = 0.0078 microM) is higher than sulotroban (IC50 = 0.93 microM) and SQ-29548 (IC50 = 0.021 microM). Moreover, BM-531 is characterized by a potent antiaggregatory property. Indeed, on one hand, in human citrated platelet-rich plasma BM-531 prevents platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (600 microM) (ED100 = 0.125 microM), U-46619, a stable TXA2 agonist (1 microM) (ED50 = 0.482 microM) or collagen (1 microgram/mL) (percentage of inhibition: 42.9% at 10 microM) and inhibits the second wave of ADP (2 microM)-induced aggregation. On the other hand, when BM-531 is incubated in whole blood from healthy donors, the closure time measured by the recently developed platelet function analyser (PFA-100) is significantly prolonged. In addition, at the concentrations of 10 and 1 microM, BM-531 totally prevents the production of TXB2 by human platelets activated by arachidonic acid. Finally, at 10 microM, BM-531 significantly prevents rat fundus contractions induced by U-46619 but not by prostacyclin. These results suggest that BM-531, which is devoid of the diuretic property of torasemide, can be regarded as a promising antiplatelet agent.

8280521|t|Balloon dilatation (valvoplasty) as first line treatment for severe stenosis of the aortic valve in early infancy: medium term results and determinants of survival.
8280521|a|OBJECTIVE--To assess the results of balloon dilatation of the aortic valve as first line treatment for infants presenting in the first two months of life with cardiac failure caused by severe aortic stenosis. DESIGN--A prospective study of all such infants presenting to a single centre over a three year period. PATIENTS--Of 14 consecutive infants aged < 2 months presenting with heart failure due to severe stenosis of the aortic valve, 12 underwent balloon dilatation of the valve. Two infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome were excluded. Six patients had other significant cardiac malformations, nine had endocardial fibroelastosis. Four infants were moribund at presentation. INTERVENTIONS--Balloon dilatation was performed through the femoral artery under general anaesthetic, with heparin and antibiotic prophylaxis. Maximum inflated balloon size was selected as equal to or slightly less than the diameter of the aortic valve measured echocardiographically. In two infants balloon dilatation of coexistent severe coarctation was performed at the same time. RESULTS--Dilatation was achieved in all cases. Early survival rate (up to one month) was 75%; 50% survive up to three years. The two deaths occurring < 24 hours after dilatation probably related to the infants' poor condition at presentation and the presence of significant left ventricular hypoplasia. The other early death was due to severe mitral regurgitation from papillary muscle dysfunction. All later deaths were related to associated malformations. The difference in left ventricular size (diameter and length) measured echocardiographically at presentation between survivors and those that died is significant (p < or = 0.002). 83% of deaths occurred in infants with associated malformations. Cusp perforation occurred in one infant, which may have contributed to this patient's death. Left ventricular perforation and cardiac tamponade were treated successfully by prompt pericardiocentesis in another. CONCLUSIONS--Balloon dilatation of the aortic valve is an acceptable first line treatment for neonates with severe symptomatic stenosis of the aortic valve. Outcome depends principally on left ventricular size and on the presence, severity, and timing of treatment of associated malformations. Severe endocardial fibroelastosis was not a risk factor for early death but may have implications for long term survival. The survival rate for this high risk group might be improved by a stratified approach where patients with adequate left ventricular size have balloon dilatation whereas those with severe ventricular hypoplasia are managed like patients with the hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

It was shown that a slow fusion process occurs between two types of liposomes. Also, the transfer of oleic acid from pH-sensitive liposomes to plain liposomes takes place. This transfer results in the increased permeability of both pH-sensitive and plain liposomes, facilitating the release of liposome-entrapped fluorescent dye. The data obtained were used for a possible explanation of the mechanism of intracytoplasmic drug delivery by pH-sensitive oleic acid-containing liposomes.

We reviewed 181 consecutive patients referred with visual complaints following closed head trauma. A motor vehicle accident was the most common etiology of trauma in 57% of cases, direct trauma to the head in 15%, and injuries sustained from a fall in 13%. Sixty-three percent of patients lost consciousness and 26% suffered a skull fracture. Thirty-five percent of all patients had visual field defects with functional (tunnel) fields the most common. Over 88% of eyes had 20/20 or better visual acuity. Thirty-three percent of patients suffered a cranial nerve palsy, with 75% resolving without intervention. The severity of head injury was directly related to the lack of proper seat belt and helmet use. Most visual complaints were improved with a simple refraction. Most binocular diplopia cleared with time, with only 15 cases requiring surgical correction.

12503947|t|Management of botulism.
12503947|a|OBJECTIVE: To provide a concise review of the presentation and treatment of botulism. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE (1966-November 2001), tertiary references, and public and government Internet sites were conducted. STUDY SELECTION: All articles and additional references from those articles were thoroughly evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Clostridium botulinum toxin blocks acetylcholine release in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in acute symmetric diplopia, dysarthria, dysphonia, dysphagia, and possible neurologic sequelae despite the route of exposure (i.e., food-borne, wound, intestinal, inhalation). Disease secondary to genetically engineered C. botulinum may differ from that of inadvertent exposure. Present treatment is primarily supportive care, respiratory support, rapid decontamination, and antitoxin administration (i.e., trivalent, pentavalent, heptavalent antitoxin). Early initiation of antitoxin limits the extent of paralysis, but does not reverse it. CONCLUSIONS: Supportive care and the use of antitoxin have been effective in the treatment of botulism from food-borne, intestinal, and wound exposure. However, the effectiveness of antitoxin in the treatment of inhaled C. botulinum has not been proven.

11693331|t|CD40 and CD86 upregulation with divergent CMRF44 expression on blood dendritic cells in inflammatory bowel diseases.
11693331|a|OBJECTIVE: Dendritic cells (DC) are the only antigen-presenting cells that can activate naive T lymphocytes and initiate a primary immune response. They are also thought to have a role in immune tolerance. DC traffic from the blood to peripheral tissue where they become activated. They then present antigen and the costimulating signals necessary to initiate an immune response. In this study, we investigated the number, subsets, and activation pattern of circulating and intestinal DC from patients with clinically mild ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease. METHODS: Patients were recruited, if they were not taking immunosuppressive therapy, and were assessed for clinical severity of their disease using for UC, the Clinical Activity Index, and for Crohn's disease, the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Blood CD11c+ and CD11c- DC subsets, expression of costimulatory antigens, CD86 and CD40, and the early differentiation/activation antigen, CMRF44, were enumerated by multicolor flow cytometry of lineage negative (lin- = CD3-, CD19-, CD14-, CD16-) HLA-DR+ DC. These data were compared with age-matched healthy and the disease control groups of chronic noninflammatory GI diseases (cGI), acute noninflammatory GI diseases (aGI), and chronic non-GI inflammation (non-GI). In addition, cryostat sections of colonoscopic biopsies from healthy control patients and inflamed versus noninflamed gut mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients were examined for CD86+ and CD40+ lin- cells. RESULTS: Twenty-one Crohn's disease and 25 UC patients, with mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index of 98 and Clinical Activity Index of 3.1, and 56 healthy controls, five cGI, five aGI, and six non-GI were studied. CD11c+ and CD11c- DC subsets did not differ significantly between Crohn's, UC, and healthy control groups. Expression of CD86 and CD40 on freshly isolated blood DC from Crohn's patients appeared higher (16.6%, 31%) and was significantly higher in UC (26.6%, 46.3%) versus healthy controls (5.5%, 25%) (p = 0.004, p = 0.012) and non-GI controls (10.2%, 22.8%) (p = 0.012, p = 0.008), but not versus cGI or aGI controls. CD86+ and CD40+ DC were also present in inflamed colonic and ileal mucosa from UC and Crohn's patients but not in noninflamed IBD mucosa or normal mucosa. Expression of the CMRF44 antigen was low on freshly isolated DC, but it was upregulated after 24-h culture on DC from all groups, although significantly less so on DC from UC versus Crohn's or healthy controls (p = 0.024). The CMRF44+ antigen was mainly associated with CD11c+ DC, and in UC was inversely related to the Clinical Activity Index (r = -0.69, p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: There is upregulation of costimulatory molecules on blood DC even in very mild IBD but surprisingly, there is divergent expression of the differentiation/activation CMRF44 antigen. Upregulation of costimulatory molecules and divergent expression of CMRF44 in blood DC was also apparent in cGI and aGI but not in non-GI or healthy controls, whereas intestinal CD86+ and CD40+ DC were found only in inflamed mucosa from IBD patients. Persistent or distorted activation of blood DC or divergent regulation of costimulatory and activation antigens may have important implications for gut mucosal immunity and inflammation.

6806222|t|The value of "routine tests" in the staging evaluation of gynecologic malignancies: a cost effectiveness analysis.
6806222|a|The value of tests employed in the clinical staging of patients with carcinomas of the cervix and endometrium has been examined in a retrospective review of 739 consecutive patients seen at Tufts-New England Medical Center. The yield of positive results of the barium enema (0%) and proctosigmoidoscopy (0.8%) in carcinoma of the cervix suggests that some of these studies may be omitted in asymptomatic patients with early disease on pelvic examinations. Similarly, for carcinoma of the endometrium, the yields from barium enema (0.9%) cytoscopy (0.9%) and proctosigmoidoscopy (0.6) are low. It is concluded that optimal patient care (with respect to morbidity and costs) may be provided without routinely performing these studies in staging asymptomatic patients with cervical and endometrial carcinomas.

17414972|t|Effects of synaptic depression and recovery on synchronous network activity.
17414972|a|SUMMARY: The output of an artificial neural network of spiking neurons linked by glutamatergic synapses subject to use-dependent depression was compared with physiologic data obtained from rat hippocampal area CA3 in vitro. The authors evaluated how network burst initiation and termination was affected by activity-dependent depression and recovery under a variety of experimental conditions including neuronal membrane depolarization, altered glutamate release probability, the strength of synaptic inhibition, and long-term potentiation and long-term depression of recurrent glutamatergic synapses. The results of computational experiments agreed with the in vitro data and support the idea that synaptic properties, including activity-dependent depression and recovery, play important roles in the timing and duration of spontaneous bursts of network activity. This validated network model is useful for experiments that are not feasible in vitro, and makes possible the investigation of two-dimensional aspects of burst propagation and termination.

648521|t|Photochemical modifications of the tryptophan residues of wheat-germ agglutinin in the presence of trichloroethanol.
648521|a|Trichloroethanol is an efficient quencher of indole fluorescence of model compounds and proteins [Eftink, M. R. and Ghiron, C. A. (1976) J. Phys. Chem. 80, 486--493]. At low quencher concentrations, the quenching follows the classical Stern-Volmer law. Bimolecular rate constants calculated from measured quenching constants and lifetimes are equal to 6 X 10(9) M-1s-1 and 1.2 X 10(9) M-1s-1 for N-acetyltrypotophanamide and wheat germ agglutinin, respectively. Upon ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of trichloroethanol, transformation of fluorescent tryptophan occurs, leading to a fluorescent photoproduct. This can be easily used as a method for the quantitative determination of fluorescent tryptophan residues in proteins. In good agreement with previous results, two fluorescent tryptophan residues per polypeptide chain are found in wheat germ agglutinin. Concomitantly with the photochemical reactions, the hemagglutinating protein activity and its affinity constant towards chitin oligomers are reduced. A probable location of tryptophan residues in the binding sites of wheat germ agglutinin is proposed.

8287030|t|Cytotoxicity of platinum(IV) and platinum(II) complexes containing 1R,2R-cyclohexanediamine as a ligand.
8287030|a|Several Pt(IV) and Pt(II) complexes containing 1R,2R-cyclohexanediamine (1R,2R-dach) as a carrier ligand were synthesized. The cytotoxicities and the uptake of the platinum complexes by leukemia L1210 cells were compared in order to study the correlation between their structures and cytotoxicities. [Pt(II)Cl2(1R,2R-dach)], [(Pt(II)(oxalato)(1R,2R-dach)], and [Pt(II)(malonato)(1R,2R-dach)], which have excellent anticancer properties, exhibited very high cytotoxicities and were easily taken up by leukemia L1210 cells. [Pt(IV)Cl4(1R,2R-dach)], trans(Cl)-[Pt(IV)Cl2(oxalato)(1R,2R-dach)], and trans(Cl)-[Pt(IV)Cl2(malonato)(1R,2R-dach)] also had high cytotoxicities. After a short incubation time, the uptake of [Pt(II)Cl2(1R,2R-dach)], [Pt(II)(oxalato)(1R,2R-dach)], and [Pt(II)(malonato)(1R,2R-dach)] by leukemia L1210 cells were respectively very similar to those of [Pt(IV)Cl4(1R,2R-dach)], trans(Cl)-[Pt(IV)Cl2(oxalato)(1R,2R-dach)], and trans(Cl)-[Pt(IV)Cl2(malonato)(1R,2R-dach)]. In addition, trans(OH)-[Pt(IV)(OH)2Y2(1R,2R-dach)] (Y2: oxalato or malonato) did not exhibit cytotoxicity towards leukemia L1210 cells, whereas trans(Cl)-[Pt(IV)Cl2Y2(1R,2R-dach)] (Y2: oxalato or malonato) were highly cytotoxic. The accumulation of trans(OH)-[Pt(IV)(OH)2Y2(1R,2R-dach)] in leukemia L1210 cells was much lower than that of trans(Cl)-[Pt(IV)Cl2Y2(1R,2R-dach)]. Platinum(IV) complexes, in which leaving groups are replaced by hydroxide groups, have decreased cytotoxic activity, because the hydroxide groups of the platinum(IV) complex reduce the uptake of platinum by the cells. trans(OH),cis(Cl)-[Pt(IV)(OH)2Cl2(1R,2R-dach)], which has hydroxide and chloride groups, was easily incorporated into the cells and exhibited the high cytotoxic activity. This behavior indicates that the chloride group apparently overcomes the ameliorating effect of the hydroxide group.

18843409|t|Biosynthesis of a novel cyclic C35-terpene via the cyclisation of a Z-type C35-polyprenyl diphosphate obtained from a nonpathogenic Mycobacterium species.
18843409|a|Lipid components from 12 nonpathogenic Mycobacterium species were analysed. A novel cyclic C(35)-terpene, named heptaprenylcycline , was obtained from 3 species, while octahydroheptaprenol , which has 3 Z-double bonds, was obtained from 6 species. The amounts of and in the cultured cells increased after the 4- to 6-d stationary phase. The yield of was considerably greater at a higher temperature of 37 degrees C than at an optimal temperature of 28 degrees C, while that of remained unchanged at all temperatures. A feeding experiment with d-[1-(13)C]glucose revealed that was produced via isopentenyl diphosphate, which is a metabolite of glycolysis and the methylerythritol phosphate pathway. The conversion of octahydroheptaprenyl diphosphate to was successful by using the cell-free extracts of M. chlorophenolicum, demonstrating that is the biosynthetic intermediate of . This is the first example of the biosynthesis of a natural terpene via the cyclisation of a linear C(35)-isoprenoid. The substrate for C(35)-terpene cyclase has Z-type prenyl moieties; however, terpene cyclases usually employ E-type isoprenoids. The gene encoding the terpene cyclase that cyclises prenyl diphosphate containing Z-double bonds as the natural substrate has not yet been detected. Despite a careful search using the FASTA3 program, we could not detect any gene that is homologous to the known diphosphate-triggered type of mono-, sesqui- and diterpene cyclases in the genome of M. vanbaalenii, the DNA sequence of which has recently been elucidated. This suggests that a novel type of terpene cyclase might exist in the nonpathogenic Mycobacterium species.

17163238|t|Healthcare use, social burden and costs of children with and without ADHD in Flanders, Belgium.
17163238|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to provide quantitative information on the economic, social and emotional burden borne by families of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and on the public healthcare costs of a child with ADHD in Flanders, Belgium, and to compare costs of ADHD children with those of siblings without the disorder. METHODS: A pilot-tested questionnaire was sent to all members of the Flemish ADHD society in February 2003. Parents were asked to record utilisation of healthcare, social care and other non-medical resources for their ADHD child and his/her sibling. In addition, data were collected on ADHD severity (IOWA-Conners Rating Scale) and on the sociodemographic and economic characteristics of the parents. Parents' out-of-pocket and public annual costs were calculated using tariffs. These costs were corrected for several confounding variables using general linear model (GLM) estimates. RESULTS: ADHD affects school results and parents' productivity and places a psychological and emotional burden on the family. Childhood ADHD also results in a significantly higher use of healthcare: ADHD children have a significantly higher probability of visiting a general practitioner (60.3% vs 37.4%) and a specialist (50.9% vs 12.9%); they also visit the emergency department significantly more often (26% vs 12.1%), and they are hospitalised significantly more often (14% vs 8.4%). Consequently, Flemish children with ADHD incur significantly higher medical costs than their siblings without the disorder. Even after correction for several covariates, these cost differences are still striking. In fact, compared with their sibling, the annual cost for an ADHD child is more than six times higher for the parent (Euro 588.3 vs Euro 91.5), and public costs are twice as high (Euro 779 vs Euro 371.3) [year of costing 2002]. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood ADHD results in significantly higher use of healthcare and adversely affects academic achievements and parents' productivity.

3192519|t|Mutagenesis of the glycosylation site of human ApoCIII. O-linked glycosylation is not required for ApoCIII secretion and lipid binding.
3192519|a|We have used site-directed in vitro mutagenesis to alter the codon ACT of human apoCIII gene, specifying Thr-74, to GCT (Ala-74). The normal and mutant apoCIII genes were then placed under the control of the mouse metallothionein 1 promoter in a bovine papilloma virus vector and were used for cell transfection and selection of stable cell lines. Blotting analysis of RNA isolated from several independent cell clones showed that both the normal and mutant genes produced apoCIII mRNA in amounts larger than that found in human fetal liver. Pulse-chase analysis of cell clones expressing the normal and mutant apoCIII genes showed that only the normal apoCIII is modified intracellularly to produce a disialated form (apoCIIIs2). Cell clones expressing the normal apoCIII gene secrete exclusively the disialated form, whereas those expressing the mutant gene secrete the unmodified form. The amount of mutant apoCIII protein produced by C127 cell clones expressing the mutant gene was reduced as compared to that produced by the control cells. Density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of the secreted apoCIII showed that the flotation properties of the secreted normal and mutant proteins were similar. These findings suggest that the intracellular glycosylation of apoCIII is not required for its intracellular transport and secretion. Furthermore, lack of glycosylation has no effect on the relative affinities of apoCIII for plasma very low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins.

18331466|t|Mycobacterial infection induces the secretion of high-mobility group box 1 protein.
18331466|a|High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is a non-histone nuclear protein that acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and is released by monocytes and macrophages. Necrotic cells also release HMGB1 at the site of tissue damage which induces a variety of cellular responses, including the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. This study investigated the secretion of HMGB1 in mycobacterial infection by macrophages in vitro and in the lungs of infected guinea pigs. We observed that infection by mycobacterium effectively induced HMGB1 release in both macrophage and monocytic cell cultures. Culture filtrate proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis induced maximum release of HMGB1 compared with different subcellular fractions of mycobacterium. We demonstrated that HMGB1 is released in lungs during infection of M. tuberculosis in guinea pigs and increased HMGB1 secretion in lungs of guinea pigs was delayed by prior vaccination with Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The secretion of cytokines like tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin-1beta was significantly increased when M. bovis BCG-infected cultures of J774A.1 cells were incubated with HMGB1. Among different mycobacterial toll-like receptor ligands, heat-shock protein 65 (HSP65) was found to be more potent in inducing HMGB1 secretion in RAW 264.7 cells. Pharmacological suppression of p38 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases with specific inhibitors failed to inhibit HSP65-induced HMGB1 release, but inhibition of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation attenuated HMGB1 release. Inhibition of the inducible NO synthase and neutralizing antibodies against TNF-alpha also reduced HMGB1 release stimulated by HSP65. We conclude that HMGB1 is secreted by macrophages during tuberculosis and it may act as a signal of tissue or cellular injury and enhances immune response.

18654448|t|Nanomagnetic actuation of receptor-mediated signal transduction.
18654448|a|Complex cell behaviours are triggered by chemical ligands that bind to membrane receptors and alter intracellular signal transduction. However, future biosensors, medical devices and other microtechnologies that incorporate living cells as system components will require actuation mechanisms that are much more rapid, robust, non-invasive and easily integrated with solid-state interfaces. Here we describe a magnetic nanotechnology that activates a biochemical signalling mechanism normally switched on by binding of multivalent chemical ligands. Superparamagnetic 30-nm beads, coated with monovalent ligands and bound to transmembrane receptors, magnetize when exposed to magnetic fields, and aggregate owing to bead-bead attraction in the plane of the membrane. Associated clustering of the bound receptors acts as a nanomagnetic cellular switch that directly transduces magnetic inputs into physiological cellular outputs, with rapid system responsiveness and non-invasive dynamic control. This technique may represent a new actuator mechanism for cell-based microtechnologies and man-machine interfaces.

1691587|t|DNA polymerase alpha. An immunohistochemical marker for proliferating cells in normal and neoplastic human tissues.
1691587|a|DNA polymerase alpha is a DNA replicating enzyme expressed in all proliferating cells. This nuclear antigen in paraformaldehyde-postfixed frozen sections of normal, benign, and malignant tissues was identified by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique with the use of a mouse monoclonal antibody against bovine/human DNA polymerase alpha. The nuclei of normal proliferating cells were positive. Malignant tumors (n = 95) showed a higher proportion of positive nuclei than did low-grade malignant tumors (n = 7) or benign lesions (n = 67). The number of positive nuclei in squamous cell carcinomas (n = 19) was higher than in adenocarcinomas (n = 45). Eight (18%) adenocarcinomas and all five renal cell carcinomas had less than 10% positive cells, whereas in benign tissues, such as pituitary adenomas, a thymoma, reactive lymphoid lesions, and some benign mammary nodules, more than 10% of nuclei were labeled. In addition, foci of proliferating cells were clearly recognized. DNA polymerase alpha is, therefore, an excellent marker of proliferative activity that provides an approach to analyzing tumor cell heterogeneity not only in fully developed neoplasms, but also in their precursor lesions.

11239792|t|Tissue factor, the blood, and the arterial wall.
11239792|a|Thrombogenic tissue factor (TF) on cell-derived microparticles is present in the circulating blood of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Recently, we reported that leukocytes transfer TF-positive particles to platelet thrombi, making them capable of triggering and propagating thrombus growth. This observation changes the original dogma that vessel-wall injury and exposure of tissue factor within the vasculature to blood is sufficient for the occurrence of arterial thrombosis. The transfer of TF-positive leukocyte particles is dependent on the interaction of CD15 and TF with platelet thrombi. The inhibition of TF transfer and TF activity suggests a novel therapeutic approach to the prevention of thrombosis that may prove to be effective in disorders associated with increased blood TF.

16359048|t|Mitral valve surgery using the classical 'heartport' technique.
16359048|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Mitral surgery in selected patients using femoral cannulation, percutaneous retrograde cardioplegia and endoballoon aortic occlusion with a 4-5 cm thoracotomy is felt to carry a higher operative risk than sternotomy with conventional cannulation. Herein, the authors compared their experience of the first 117 'Heartport' (HP) patients with a computer-matched group of sternotomy approach surgical patients (SP) to assess operative risk and 30-day outcome. METHODS: Data were extracted from the authors' STS certified, audited database on 117 patients based on an intention to treat. Between December 1997 and December 2004, a total of 92 isolated mitral valve (MV) repair (HP-MVRpr) and 25 isolated MV replacement (HP-MVR) procedures was conducted using Heartport. The patients were matched 1:1 (by age +/-7 years, cerebrovascular disease, inotrope use, and ejection fraction +/- 5%) to a control SP group. Operative and 30-day outcomes were measured. RESULTS: No parameter showed any significant difference in 30-day outcome between the HP and SP groups, except for an increase in cross-clamp and perfusion times. Two patients in the HP-MVRpr group required conversion to sternotomy for repair of coronary sinus perforation, and one patient was repaired without conversion. Surgery in one HP-MVRpr patient was aborted due to limited aortic dissection, but successful repair was carried out later with a conventional approach. No patient required conversion to sternotomy for improved exposure of the operative site. CONCLUSION: Despite a longer cross-clamp time, 'classical' HP MV surgery can be performed with no increased risk compared to conventional MV surgery. Catheter and endoballoon complications were rare even in the early experience, and conversion to sternotomy was unusual and safely performed with this approach.

18718783|t|A comparative study of histologic response to different pulp capping materials and a novel endodontic cement.
18718783|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare dogs' pulp response to capping with calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), and a novel endodontic cement (NEC). STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four canine teeth in 6 beagle dogs were buccocervically exposed and capped with MTA, Dycal, or NEC. Eight weeks later, retrieved samples were observed by optical microscope to grade inflammation, formation of dentinal bridge, calcification, necrosis, and presence of odontoblast cells. RESULTS: No inflammation was observed in MTA and NEC groups, and in 75% of each, dentinal bridge was completely formed. In the Dycal group, inflammation and incomplete dentinal bridge were detected in all cases. Although MTA and NEC groups had no significant difference between them in each measure, the difference between all 3 groups was significant (P < .001). CONCLUSION: MTA and NEC showed similar favorable biologic response in pulp cap treatment, better than Dycal, especially in inducing the formation of dentinal bridge.

9713666|t|Comparison of simulated patient and didactic methods of teaching HIV risk assessment to medical residents.
9713666|a|INTRODUCTION: Physicians need to be well trained in HIV risk assessment interview skills. Little has been written in the literature concerning training methods for this specialized interview. METHODS: One model to teach the HIV risk assessment interview has been developed and has been used to teach third-year medical students. We compared this interactive model, which uses simulated patients to teach HIV Risk Assessment, to a didactic one. Twelve medical residents were taken through either the interactive session or the didactic session. Pre-post changes from questionnaires were calculated to determine any differences in sessions. Also, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) were used to grade all residents 2 weeks after their sessions. RESULTS: All pre-post changes were calculated and no statistically significant differences were seen (P > 0.50). OSCE interpersonal skills scores and content scores were calculated. The interactive group had statistically significantly higher scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The data supports the conclusion that an interactive method is more effective to use to train HIV risk assessment interview skills to medical residents when compared to the didactic method.

7349483|t|[Puromycin action on intestinal lipid absorption in male and female rats]
7349483|a|The effect of puromycin on absorption balance and mucosal lipid distribution was studied during intestinal absorption of 14C oleic acid and 3H palmitic acid, using the isolated intestinal loop of male and female rats in situ. In puromycin-treated animals, mucosal lipid uptake was reduced and mucosal lipid content increased, particularly with oleic acid and in male rats. The phospholipids were significantly reduced. As revealed by mucosal accumulation of free fatty acids, esterification was particularly inhibited with oleic acid and in female rats. These results might explain why portal blood radioactivity was higher in treated rats than in the controls. Puromycin effect occurred at different stages of lipid absorption and varied with sex.

3941439|t|Outpatient surgery in pediatric urology.
3941439|a|Indications for ambulatory pediatric urological surgery have been broadened to include most inguinal and scrotal surgery, many endoscopic procedures and distal hypospadias repairs with or without chordee or urethroplasty. We have reviewed a 1-year experience with the 440 outpatient urological procedures performed at Children's Hospital of Michigan in 1984, and found a low (3.4 per cent) incidence of postoperative hospitalization and only a single complication. We conclude that outpatient surgery in well selected patients and procedures is safe, timely and economical.

7141937|t|Advantages and limitations of computed tomography scans for treatment planning of lung cancer.
7141937|a|Forty-five Chest computed tomography (CT) scans performed on patients with lung carcinoma (LC) were evaluated in an attempt to understand the pattern of intrathoracic tumor spread and the advantages and limitations this technique offers for treatment planning when compared to planning done by conventional X rays. The following findings can help treatment planning. (1) When regular X rays do not show tumor location (i.e., hemithorax opacification), CT scan will show it in 68% of patients. If regular X rays show a well localized mass, unsuspected tumor extensions were disclosed in 78% of these patients. Hence, CT scans should be done in all LC patients prior to treatment planning; (2) Mediastinal masses frequently spread anteriorly toward the sternum and posteriorly around the vertebral bodies toward the cord and costal pleura. This should be considered for radiotherapy boost techniques; (3) Lung masses spread in one third of cases toward the lateral costal pleura. Thus, the usual 1-2cm of safety margin around the LC are not sufficient in some cases; (4) Tumor size can appear much smaller in regular X rays than in CT scans. Hence, CT scans are necessary for accurate staging and evaluation of tumor response. Some CT scan limitations are: (1) Atelectasis blends with tumor in approximately half of the patients, thus obscuring tumor boundaries; (2) CT numbers and contrast enhancement did not help to differentiate between these two structures; and (3) Limited definition of CT scan prevents investigation of suspected microscopic spread around tumor masses.

16904579|t|Comparison of suture welding and hand-tied knots in mini-open rotator cuff repair.
16904579|a|PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to compare the results of mini-open rotator cuff repair with outcomes attained with hand-tied knots and suture welds. METHODS: A total of 50 consecutive patients treated by a single surgeon with mini-open cuff repair and suture welding were retrospectively evaluated and compared with 55 consecutive patients treated with mini-open cuff repair and hand-tied knots. The groups were similar in terms of age, sex, hand dominance, and preoperative duration of symptoms. All procedures were performed in a hospital outpatient surgery center with patients in a lateral decubitus position under general anesthetic. Glenohumeral arthroscopy and arthroscopic acromioplasty were performed in all cases. Rotator cuff tears were repaired through enlargement of the lateral portal. All patients were evaluated before and after surgery with the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Scale. RESULTS: In all, 47 of 50 patients treated with suture weld were available for evaluation, with an average follow-up of 26 months. Preoperative UCLA scores averaged 12.5, and postoperative scores averaged 29.6. Of 55 patients treated with hand-tied knots, 40 were available, with an average follow-up of 28 months. Preoperative UCLA scores averaged 13.2, and postoperative scores averaged 31.5. CONCLUSIONS: No statistical difference in postoperative UCLA scores was noted between the 2 groups (P = .297). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative study.

7700531|t|Thalamocortical and corticocortical excitatory postsynaptic potentials mediated by excitatory amino acid receptors in the cat motor cortex in vivo.
7700531|a|Intracellular recordings were made from neurons in the motor cortex of an anaesthetized cat, together with iontophoretic application of excitatory amino acid receptor agonists and antagonists, in order to evaluate the role of such receptors in excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked from stimulation of afferent and recurrent pathways in vivo. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials which were evoked by stimulation of the ventrolateral thalamus were found to be largely insensitive to antagonism by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, although they were susceptible to blockade by the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. Increasing the ventrolateral thalamus stimulation frequency from 0.5 or 1 to 5 Hz caused an increase of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes and number of action potentials. These augmented excitatory postsynaptic potentials remained insensitive to application of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists. In contrast, recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of the pyramidal tract were found to be sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists and/or non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists in some neurons. These results demonstrate the involvement of both N-methyl-D-aspartate- and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in synaptic responses of cat motor cortex neurons in vivo, and that the synaptic pharmacology of the thalamic input may differ from that of the local recurrent pathways.

11555348|t|An open pilot trial of olanzapine for delirium in the Korean population.
11555348|a|This study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine for the treatment of delirium in a Korean population. An open trial of olanzapine was conducted in Korean patients with delirium caused by multiple medicosurgical conditions. All subjects were evaluated by Delirium Rating Scale (DRS), which is known to be one of the most sensitive scales for delirium. In addition, other data for profiles of side-effects were collected and analyzed. Twenty patients were treated by olanzapine with doses of 5.9 +/- 1.5 mg/day. The initial dose was 4.6 +/- 0.9 mg/day and maximal dose of olanzapine was 8.8 +/- 2.2 mg/day. The average duration of treatment was 6.6 +/- 1.7 days and the day of maximal response was 3.8 +/- 1.7 treated days. The scores of DRS were significantly improved from 20.0 +/- 3.6 at the time of pretreatment to 9.3 +/- 4.6 at the post-treatment. All subjects showed no definite serious side-effects including anticholinergic and extrapyramidal symptoms. Olanzapine treatment for patients with delirium was effective and safe. This newer drug may be a useful alternative agent to classical antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium.

1739566|t|Fresh gas requirements of an enclosed afferent reservoir breathing system during controlled ventilation in children.
1739566|a|An enclosed afferent reservoir breathing system (EAR) designed by Ohmeda was evaluated during anaesthesia with controlled ventilation in 104 healthy children. Carbon dioxide production and arterial carbon dioxide tension were measured in 12 children in order to determine the proportion of fresh gas (VF) involved in gas exchange. When the ratio of minute volume ventilation to fresh gas flow (VE:VF) exceeded 1.5, fractional utilization of fresh gas with the EAR was 0.92. This value and values of carbon dioxide production obtained from 43 children were used to derive a simple formula relating fresh gas flow requirements to body weight. The formula, VF = 0.6 x weight 0.5, was assessed in 49 children weighing 10-70 kg. The mean end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide in these patients was 4.5 kPa (range 3.8-5.2 kPa). We conclude that the EAR has an efficiency of 92% in the use of fresh gas during controlled ventilation in healthy children, provided the VE:VF ratio is greater than 1.5. Under these conditions, normocapnia to mild hypocapnia was produced accurately using the formula VF = 0.6 x weight 0.5.

17469033|t|Quali-quantitative analysis of urinary glycosaminoglycans for monitoring glomerular inflammatory activity.
17469033|a|OBJECTIVE: A 2-year follow-up study was carried out in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in order to verify the possible use of quali-quantitative analysis of urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) as a prognostic index of disease and for drug treatment monitoring. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten patients with IgAN were evaluated at four time points: baseline, and 6, 9 and 24 months later. GAGs were isolated from 24-h urine using ion-exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel, and concentrations were expressed as milligrams of hexuronate per gram of creatinine. GAG composition was determined by cellulose acetate electrophoresis and expressed as relative percentages by means of densitometric scanning of Alcian Blue-stained strips. RESULTS: The relative content of total low-sulphated chondroitin sulphate species decreased significantly during the study period compared to baseline, whereas the relative percentages of heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate increased significantly. Moreover, a significant correlation was noted between the relative contents of urinary GAGs, renal function and inflammation indexes. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the excretion of various types of GAGs may be related to different glomerular pathophysiological conditions. Therefore, the determination of urinary GAG composition may represent a reliable indicator of disease activity.

8873104|t|The role of magnetic resonance angiography in the assessment of intracranial vascular disease.

It is extremely important for the interpreting physician to be aware of the potential limitations of the techniques being used. With this knowledge, magnetic resonance techniques can eliminate the need for more invasive procedures. An overview of the current methods and their applications and limitations is provided.

15613244|t|MAB21L2, a vertebrate member of the Male-abnormal 21 family, modulates BMP signaling and interacts with SMAD1.
15613244|a|BACKGROUND: Through in vivo loss-of-function studies, vertebrate members of the Male abnormal 21 (mab-21) gene family have been implicated in gastrulation, neural tube formation and eye morphogenesis. Despite mounting evidence of their considerable importance in development, the biochemical properties and nature of MAB-21 proteins have remained strikingly elusive. In addition, genetic studies conducted in C. elegans have established that in double mutants mab-21 is epistatic to genes encoding various members of a Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway involved in the formation of male-specific sensory organs. RESULTS: Through a gain-of-function approach, we analyze the interaction of Mab21l2 with a TGF-beta signaling pathway in early vertebrate development. We show that the vertebrate mab-21 homolog Mab21l2 antagonizes the effects of Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) overexpression in vivo, rescuing the dorsal axis and restoring wild-type distribution of Chordin and Xvent2 transcripts in Xenopus gastrulae. We show that MAB21L2 immunoprecipitates in vivo with the BMP4 effector SMAD1, whilst in vitro it binds SMAD1 and the SMAD1-SMAD4 complex. Finally, when targeted to an heterologous promoter, MAB21L2 acts as a transcriptional repressor. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first biochemical and cellular foundation for future functional studies of mab-21 genes in normal neural development and its pathological disturbances.

3961836|t|Quantification of cerebral infarct size by creatine kinase BB isoenzyme.
3961836|a|Creatine Kinase BB isoenzyme (CKBB) has been shown to rise in the serum and CSF following acute cerebral injury. To test the hypothesis that brain infarct size could be estimated from the appearance and disappearance of CKBB in the serum and CSF, strokes of varying size were produced in twelve mongrel dogs by silastic emboli. The rate of disappearance, Kd of CKBB (-.00732 +/- 0.001 min-1 mean +/- SE, N = 8) was determined by injecting purified CKBB (25 IU) intravenously then measuring its disappearance. Following the embolic stroke, serum samples were taken hourly for 24 hours and then at intervals for up to 160 hours for measurement of CKBB by radioimmunoassay until the animals were sacrificed. The brains were then removed, fixed in formalin, cut in 2 mm sections and photographed. The area of the infarct was measured using high pad digitizer interfaced with an Apple computer. The infarct size was then calculated from the area and thickness. Using a one-compartment mathematical model, the infarct size was estimated from the amount of CKBB appearing in the serum, the Kd of CKBB, and the amount of CKBB depleted from tissue. The computed infarct size correlated well (r = 0.94) with the measured infarct size. This model may have value in testing therapeutic modalities in the intact animal.

463799|t|Nitrogen balance in obese patients receiving a very low calorie liquid formula diet.
463799|a|Eleven obese patients were placed on a liquid formula diet containing 320 kcal (1.34 MJ), 31 g protein, 44 g oligosaccharides, 1.5 g fat, vitamins, and essential minerals for a period of 4 weeks under metabolic ward conditions. The diet was well tolerated, and mean weight loss was 2.49 kg/week during the 4-week period. Nitrogen excretion diminished in all patients during the period of treatment, but nitrogen balance remained slightly negative in most patients, mean daily deficit being 1.3 g N/day at the end of the study. The rate at which nitrogen was loss declined in a biphasic fashion, a slower second phase after an initial rapid period of adjustment to the diet. During the study a mean of 4.1 +/- 1.4% SD of calculated total body nitrogen was lost. Potassium excretion studies did not reveal significant potassium losses. The amount of nitrogen loss was correlated with the urinary creatinine excretion, suggesting that nitrogen loss during reduced dietary intake of protein is largely dependent on the size of the lean body mass.

7767898|t|Effect of virus-transformation and growth factor stimulation on isoprene biosynthesis in human fibroblasts: a correlation to cell growth.
7767898|a|Serum depletion of exponentially growing normal human fibroblasts resulted in a moderate depression of the activity of HMG-CoA reductase which occurred simultaneously to the onset of growth arrest of the cells. Specific inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase using mevinolin also resulted in growth arrest. PDGF counteracted the suppressive effect of serum depletion on HMG-CoA reductase activity and cell growth. The growth inhibitory effect of serum depletion and mevinolin was correlated to a decreased biosynthesis of dolichols, in particular of dolichol-20. If PDGF was present in the serum-free medium a high rate of dolichol synthesis was maintained. This effect was mediated not only through an increased HMG-CoA reductase activity. PDGF also increased the incorporation of mevalonate into dolichols, once again into dolichol-20 in particular. In contrast to HDF, the growth of virus-transformed human fibroblasts was not decreased following serum depletion. This was correlated to a sustained activity of HMG-CoA reductase and a sustained dolichol-20 synthesis. In order to block growth and dolichol synthesis of the transformed fibroblasts a stronger inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity was required than in the normal cells. Conditioned medium isolated from the transformed cells was found to maintain a high growth rate and a high HMG-CoA reductase activity in serum-depleted HDF. In addition, the incorporation of mevalonate into dolichols was increased. The present data raise the possibility that PDGF or related factors, through autocrine loops, may contribute to the maintenance of a high dolichol synthesis in tumor cells.

8185149|t|Comprehensive discharge planning for the hospitalized elderly. A randomized clinical trial.
8185149|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of a comprehensive discharge planning protocol, designed specifically for the elderly and implemented by nurse specialists, on patient and caregiver outcomes and cost of care. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. PATIENTS: 276 patients and 125 caregivers. Patients were 70 years and older and were placed in selected medical and surgical cardiac diagnostic-related groups. MEASUREMENTS: Group differences in patient outcomes (length of initial hospital stay, length of time between initial hospital discharge and readmission, and rehospitalization rates) and charges for care (charges for initial hospitalization, rehospitalizations, health services after discharge, and nurse specialist services) were measured 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: From the initial hospital discharge to 6 weeks after discharge, patients in the medical intervention group had fewer readmissions, fewer total days rehospitalized, lower readmission charges, and lower charges for health care services after discharge. No differences in these outcomes were found between the surgical intervention and control groups during this period. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings support the need for comprehensive discharge planning designed for the elderly and implemented by nurse specialists to improve their outcomes after hospital discharge and to achieve cost savings. The findings also suggest that this intervention had its greatest effect in delaying or preventing rehospitalization of patients in the medical intervention group during the first 6 weeks after discharge.

8547855|t|Glycine blocks the pressor response to L-glutamate microinjected into the nucleus tractus solitarii of conscious rats.
8547855|a|Microinjection of L-glutamate into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) of conscious freely moving Wistar rats (240-260 g) produces pressor (+48 +/- 4 mmHg) and bradycardic (-153 +/- 20 bpm) responses. In the present study L-glutamate (2.5 nmol/100 nl) was microinjected before and after microinjection of increasing doses of glycine (10, 25 and 50 nmol/100 nl, N = 6) or saline (vehicle/100 nl, N = 6) into the NTS. Microinjections of increasing doses of glycine into the NTS produced a dose-dependent reduction in the pressor but not in the bradycardic responses to L-glutamate. [10 nmol (+29 +/- 5 mmHg and -110 +/- 18 bpm), 25 nmol (+12 +/- 7 mmHg and -88 +/- 21 bpm) and 50 nmol (+4 +/- 2 mmHg and -100 +/- 31 bpm)] The dose-dependent blockade of the pressor response to L-glutamate by glycine suggests an inhibitory neuromodulatory role for this amino acid in the sympatho-excitatory activity produced by L-glutamate microinjection into the NTS.

9486195|t|Muscarinic modulation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in insulin-secreting HIT-T15 cells.
9486195|a|Potentiation of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by acetylcholine requires ongoing cyclic electrical activity initiated by other depolarizing secretagogues. Patch-clamp recordings in glucose-free solutions were made from the clonal beta-cell line HIT-T15 to determine whether the muscarinic agonist bethanechol (BCh) modulated voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels independent of effects on membrane potential. Only high-threshold, dihydropyridine-sensitive (L-type) Ca2+ channels with a mean conductance of 26 pS were observed in cell-attached patches. BCh (100 microM) caused a two- to threefold increase in both fractional open time and mean current of single Ca2+ channels. These changes resulted from a 44% decrease in the longer of two apparent mean closed times and a 25% increase in the mean open time. Similar BCh-stimulated increases in macroscopic Ca2+ currents were recorded in whole cell, perforated-patch recordings. The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the muscarinic activation of Ca2+ channels was tested using a variety of PKC activators and inhibitors. Acute application of either the active phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or the membrane-permeable diacylglycerol analog 1,2-didecanoyl-rac-glycerol mimicked the effects of BCh, whereas an inactive phorbol (4 alpha) had no effect. Depletion of PKC activity by chronic exposure to PMA or acute application of the PKC inhibitor staurosporine greatly reduced or abolished muscarinic activation of Ca2+ channels. These results are consistent with muscarinic activation of L-type, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels mediated in large part by PKC.

Alterations in miRNA expression can contribute to tumor growth by modulating the functional expression of critical genes involved in tumor cell proliferation or survival. Our aims were to identify specific miRNA involved in the regulation of cholangiocarcinoma growth and response to chemotherapy. METHODS: miRNA expression in malignant and nonmalignant human cholangiocytes was assessed using a microarray. Expression of selected miRNA and their precursors was evaluated by Northern blots and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The effect of selected miRNA on cell growth and response to chemotherapy was assessed using miRNA-specific antisense oligonucleotides to decrease miRNA expression or with precursor miRNA to increase cellular expression. RESULTS: miRNA expression was markedly different in malignant cholangiocytes, with decreased expression of many miRNA compared with nonmalignant cells. A cluster of miRNA, including miR-320, miR-200b, miR-21, miR-23a, miR-141, miR-27a, and miR-34a, were expressed in all cell lines. MiR-21, miR-141, and miR-200b were highly over-expressed in malignant cholangiocytes. Inhibition of miR-21 and miR-200b increased sensitivity to gemcitabine, whereas inhibition of miR-141 decreased cell growth. Treatment of tumor cell xenografts with systemic gemcitabine altered the expression of a significant number of miRNA. miR-21 modulates gemcitabine-induced apoptosis by phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase signaling. Potential target genes that were modulated by selected miRNA were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in miRNA expression contribute to tumor growth and response to chemotherapy. Aberrantly expressed miRNA or their targets will provide mechanistic insight and therapeutic targets for cholangiocarcinoma.

1697278|t|[Physico-chemical characterization of human seminal plasma specific antigen p30]
1697278|a|Human seminal plasma specific antigen p30, which has been characterized by other authors under the name of prostate-specific antigen or gamma-seminoprotein, has been purified. This communication describes the physico-chemical characterization of p30 demonstrated by various SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectrofocusing as well as amino acid analysis. The results showed that the molecular weight of p30 was 33 kd and its isoelectric point was around pH 6.9. Its amino acid composition was similar to that of prostate-specific antigen. It is concluded that p30 purified by our laboratory and prostate-specific antigen named by Wang are the identical one of isomers.

14729430|t|Thymoquinone and Nigella sativa oil protection against methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinemia in rats.
14729430|a|Although the state of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) appears to be associated with higher risks of coronary, cerebral and peripheral vascular disease as well as with a number of other clinical conditions, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. There is strong evidence, however, that HHcy could induce a pathogenic state of oxidative stress. The interest in modulating the elevated levels of total homocysteine in HHcy and/or their negative impacts through preventive strategies, particularly through the supplementation with vitamins that may be linked to the homeostasis of homocysteine (folate, vitamin B(12), and vitamin B(6)), has increased in recent years. Here we show that active antioxidant components of the traditionally used black seeds of Nigella sativa plant protect against the development of methionine-induced HHcy and its associated state of oxidative stress. Pretreatment of rats with an oral dose of 100 mg/kg of thymoquinone, the main active constituent of the black seed, for 30 min and for 1 week almost completely protected against induced HHcy measured 5 h after methionine load (100 mg/kg). Under similar conditions pretreatment with commercial black seed oil (100 microl/kg) for 30 min and for 1 week produced significant and strong protection levels of 74.2 and 94.5%, respectively. Under the state of induced HHcy there were significant increases in the plasma levels of triglycerides, lipid peroxidation, cholesterol and in the activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Catalase activity was not affected. The total antioxidant status, however, was significantly depressed. All of these effects were almost totally blocked by prior treatment with thymoquinone or black seed oil. These findings may contribute towards a protective measure utilizing the black seed against the negative impacts of HHcy.

15769617|t|Structure-activity relationships OF N-methylthiolated beta-lactam antibiotics with C3 substitutions and their selective induction of apoptosis in human cancer cells.
15769617|a|The development of novel anti-cancer drugs that induce apoptosis has long been a focus of drug discovery. Beta-lactam antibiotics have been used for over 60 years to fight bacterial infectious diseases with little or no side effects observed. Recently a new class of N-methylthiolated beta-lactams has been discovered that have potent activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureas. Most recently, we determined the potential effects of these N-thiolated beta-lactams on tumorigenic cell growth and found that they are apoptosis-inducers in human cancer cell lines. In the current study, we further determined the effects of the substitution of the O-methyl moiety on C3 and stereochemistry of the beta-lactams on the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing abilities. We have found that lactam 18, in which C3 is substituted with an acrylate ester group, is a very effective proliferation inhibitor against human premalignant and malignant breast, leukemic, and simian virus 40-transformed fibroblast cells. Generally speaking, increasing the size of the moiety on C3 decreases its anti-proliferation potency, possibly indicating steric hindrance with the cellular target or decreased permeability through the cell membrane. We also found that the stereochemistry of the beta-lactams plays an important role in their potency. The 3S,4R isomers are more effective than their enantiomers (3R,4S), suggesting that 3S,4R configuration is more favorable for target interaction.

6265878|t|Solvent extraction method used in separating the protected product of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides.
6265878|a|A solvent extraction method for separating synthetic protected oligodeoxyribonucleotides was used in our laboratory based on the lipophilic property of the protecting group of 5'-OH of the oligomers. The extraction of synthetic products protected with MMTr is complete by ether or ether-chloroform (6:1 V/V) for mononucleosides, by chloroform for dinucleoside monophosphates, by dichloromethane:n-butanol (4:1 V/V) for trimer or tetramer, and is nearly complete by dichloromethane:n-butanol (2:1 V/V) for hexamer. The 5'-end phosphorylated nucleotides, oligonucleotides and their symmetrical pyrophosphates remain in water phase. The following synthetic products of protected oligodeoxyribonucleotides have been isolated with this method, all above 85% in purity: (Formula: see text).

18071266|t|Effects of excess biotin administration on the growth and urinary excretion of water-soluble vitamins in young rats.
18071266|a|To determine the effects of excess biotin administration on growth and water-soluble vitamin metabolism, weaning rats were fed on a 20% casein diet containing 0.00002% biotin, or same diet with 0.04, 0.08, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50, 0.80 or 1.0% added biotin for 28 days. More than 0.08% biotin administration decreased the food intake and body weight gain compared with the levels in control rats. An accumulation of biotin in such tissues as the liver, brain and kidney increased in a dose-dependent manner, and the both bound and free biotin contents in the liver also increased in a dose-dependent manner. An excess administration of biotin did not affect the urinary excretion of other water-soluble vitamins, suggesting no effect on the metabolism of other water-soluble vitamins. The results of the food intake and body weight gain indicated that the lowest observed adverse effect level for young rats was 79.2 mg/kg body weight/day, while the no observed adverse effect level was 38.4 mg/kg/day. These results suggested immediately setting a tolerable upper intake level for biotin.

8537265|t|Equivalent efficacies of meropenem and ceftazidime as empirical monotherapy of febrile neutropenic patients. The Meropenem Study Group of Leuven, London and Nijmegen.
8537265|a|The efficacies of meropenem, a novel carbapenem, and ceftazidime, as empirical therapy of febrile neutropenic patients, were compared in a prospective, randomized clinical trial. One hundred and twelve adult patients were given meropenem 1 g tds iv for 153 episodes of fever, while 109 patients received ceftazidime 2 g tds iv for 151 episodes. All patients survived the first 3 days of therapy and, by the end of the treatment courses, 67 (44%) episodes had responded to meropenem, compared with 62 (41%) to ceftazidime. Eighty (53%) episodes initially treated with ceftazidime and 63 (41%) episodes treated with meropenem were considered to have failed treatment because it was thought necessary to administer additional antibacterial agents; however, modifications were made twice as often because of fever that persisted beyond 2-3 days than because of obvious causes of failure such as persistent infection. Three patients in the ceftazidime group and five in the meropenem group died. Meropenem was well tolerated, with no reports of nausea or toxicity to the central nervous system. Although ceftazidime was shown in the present study to be as effective as meropenem, the broader spectrum of activity of meropenem against Gram-positive cocci suggests that it might be more appropriate as empirical therapy of febrile neutropenic patients who are at high risk of acquiring infections caused by these bacteria.

207536|t|The plasma cyclic AMP response to catecholamines as potentiated by phentolamine in rats.
207536|a|Norepinephrine failed to increase plasma cyclic AMP when injected alone into fasted rats, in contrast with sharp increases elicited by isoproterenol, epinephrine or tyramine. In rats pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine or cocain, however, there was significant increase in plasma cyclic AMP after norepinephrine injection, suggesting that the rapid neuronal catecholamine uptake was at least partly responsible for the lack of norepinephrine action. Phentolamine was very effective in enhancing the epinephrine-, norepinephrine- or tyramine-induced increase in plasma cyclic AMP but without effect on the isoproterenol-induced increase. Blockade of postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors, rather than of presynaptic receptors, is likely to be involved in the phentolamine potentiation, since it was even observed in rats treated with 6-hydroxydopamine or cocaine. A discussion is presented regarding the mechanism by which cyclic AMP generation is influenced by the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor interaction on effector cell membranes.

15346326|t|A case of severe low back pain associated with Richard disease (lumbosacral transitional vertebra).
15346326|a|The imaging findings in some cases of low back pain are difficult to describe and the pathophysiology is not clear because subjective findings are usually difficult to document. This report concerns a rare case about the lumbosacral joint causing persistent severe back pain which in itself does not usually have any pathological meaning. We describe the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of a patient suffering from low back pain with lumbosacral transitional vertebra. The radiological examination showed the congenitally malformed transverse processes of the 5th lumbar vertebra to create a facet joint-like shape at the sacral ala region on both sides. Surgery resulted in immediate disappearance of the low back pain. When the lumbosacral junction shows some instability without fusion, the joint-like region could be the cause of low back pain. The lumbosacral transitional vertebra may be associated with low back pain. Electric denervation of the space between the transverse process of 5th lumbar vertebra and sacral ala is minimally invasive and effective for pain eradication.

6977640|t|A comparative study of the effects of phenytoin and phenobarbital on electrically induced maximal seizures in frogs and mice.
6977640|a|This study was undertaken to compare seizure patterns and anticonvulsant effects of phenytoin in frogs (Rana pipiens) and the CF-1 strain of mice. Maximal seizures were induced with electroshock via corneal electrodes, and phenytoin anticonvulsant effects were determined by measuring the duration of tonic hindlimb extension (THE) and prevention of the THE. To control for any possible species difference that might be unique to phenytoin, the anticonvulsant effects of phenobarbital also were compared in frogs and mice. It was found that the dose-effect relationships for shortening THE duration and for prevention of THE by phenobarbital in frogs and mice were not significantly different in terms of slopes and potencies. With phenytoin, however, the dose-effect relationship for prevention of THE in mice was significantly steeper than that in frogs, whereas the slopes of the dose-effect relationships for shortening THE duration were not significantly different in these two species. Frogs decapitated 1.5 sec after electroshock exhibited THE durations equal to those in intact frogs, and phenytoin and phenobarbital efficacies in shortening THE duration were unchanged by decapitation. These results show that shortening of THE duration by both phenytoin and phenobarbital may reflect drug action in spinal or peripheral neural pathways. Also, it is suggested that phenytoin, but not phenobarbital, prevents THE by a selective action on cortical structures which are well developed in mice but are poorly developed or absent in frogs.

15760351|t|Plant growth forms: an ecological and evolutionary perspective.
15760351|a|Trees, shrubs, lianas and herbs have widely different mechanical architectures, which can also vary phenotypically with the environment. This review investigates how environmental effects, particularly mechanical perturbation, can influence biomechanical development in self-supporting and climbing growth forms. The bifacial vascular cambium is discussed in terms of its significance to growth form variation, ecology and evolution among extant plants, and during its appearance and early evolution. A key aspect of this developmental innovation concerned its potential for architectural and mechanical variation in response to environmental effects as well as optimizing hydraulic supply before the appearance of laminate leaves. Growth form diversity and its importance to past and present ecosystems are discussed in relation to both evolutionary constraints and ecological factors such as climatic change and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We discuss how widely ranging growth forms such as climbers show a large range of developmental and phenotypic variation that has much to offer in understanding how the environment can modify plant development, particularly in terms of the bifacial vascular cambium. The broad approach we propose would benefit a wide range of studies from research into wood development to long-term ecological censuses of today's potentially changing ecosystems.

7619973|t|Behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to metaCPP in anorexia nervosa.
7619973|a|In response to the partial serotonin agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (metaCPP), patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder have been reported to exhibit an increase in obsessive symptoms and a diminished release of prolactin and/or cortisol compared to controls. We examined the response to metaCPP of 10 patients with anorexia nervosa, before and after weight gain, and of eight healthy controls. Prior to weight gain, the patients exhibited a greater behavioral response to metaCPP than the controls and diminished prolactin and cortisol responses. Only the prolactin abnormality persisted after weight gain. These observations suggest that, in patients with anorexia nervosa, weight loss is associated with the development of neurobiological disturbances which are in some ways similar to those of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

15931513|t|Chronic changes in cerebrospinal fluid pathways produced by subarachnoid kaolin injection and experimental spinal cord trauma in the rabbit: their relationship with the development of spinal deformity. An electron microscopic study and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation.
15931513|a|Post-traumatic cystic changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways such as ventriculomegaly and/or hydrosyringomyelia are not uncommon, but their characteristics have not yet been fully clarified. This study was designed to investigate the alterations affecting the CSF pathways in rabbits at a late stage, and to clarify the relationship between these changes and the development of spinal deformity. In this study, a total of 60 New Zealand white rabbits were used and they were segregated into four different groups of 15 animals each: sham-operation group, kaolin group, and kaolin plus mild trauma group and kaolin plus severe trauma group. The animals were subjected to radiological investigation using direct X-ray study and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 4 months. The thoracic spinal cords of the animals were dissected after intracardiac perfusion-fixation with 10% formalin for light microscopy and 2.5% glutaraldehyde for transmission electron microscopic study. Following the sectioning and staining procedures, the histological characteristics of the spinal cords were evaluated with light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. A spinal deformity developed in 90% in rabbits in both kaolin injection group and spinal trauma groups. MRI revealed generalized dilatation of the ventricular system and the central canal of the spinal cord after the kaolin injection with/without trauma in this study. Gross morphologic examination showed some enlargement of entire CSF pathways in these groups. All animals with central canal dilatation had mild or severe scoliotic and kyphotic deformities. In a light microscopic study, a denuded ependymal line and multicyst formations in periependymal areas were found in both kaolin injection and spinal trauma groups. Ultrastructurally, an apical flattening of the ependyma, microcysts in the ependymal cells, axonal degeneration, demyelination, and loss of ependymal cells adjacent mild spongy were found in the spinal cords of animals in these groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the chronic effects of spinal cord injury (SCI) on the CSF pathways and their relationship with the development of spinal deformity in an experimental model of kaolin injection and trauma, using MRI as well as light and transmission electron microscopy. In the light of this study, the severity of spinal cord injury on the development of some degenerative findings in the spinal cord was clear, but further clinical and experimental studies using dynamic imaging techniques will be valuable.

2281858|t|A spectrophotometric method for the estimation of polymer-supported sulfhydryl groups.
2281858|a|A sensitive and simple method is described for the quantitative determination of free sulfhydryl (-SH) groups on polymer supports. The method includes the reaction of 4,4'-dimethoxytrityloxy-S-(2-thio-5-nitropyridyl)-2-mercapto ethane (DTNPME) with polymer-supported sulfhydryl groups. After removal of excess reagent through washing, a weighed quantity of the polymer support is treated with perchloric acid to release the 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl cation from the polymer support into the solution. The dimethoxytrityl cation (lambda max = 498 nm, epsilon 498 = 70,000/M) is then quantified spectrophotometrically. A comparative study of the reagent DTNPME with 2,2'-dithiobis(5-nitropyridine) is also described.

2182939|t|Association between sympathetic activity and the atherogenic serum cholesterol fraction.
2182939|a|A possible modulating influence of noradrenergic activity on serum lipoproteins was assessed under placebo conditions and following 4 weeks of sympathetic neurone blockade with debrisoquine in 9 normal subjects, 11 patients with mild essential hypertension, 9 normotensive, and 9 hypertensive hemodialysis patients. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) did not differ significantly among groups on placebo and was consistently reduced (P less than 0.05-0.001) by sympathetic blockade. The latter also decreased (P less than 0.05-0.001) plasma total cholesterol (C) as well as low and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL + VLDL-C) in the three patient groups. In the two dialysis groups, basal levels of plasma triglycerides (Tg) were increased and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was diminished (P less than 0.01-0.001); sympathetic blockade lowered Tg and raised HDL-C (P less than 0.01-0.001). In normal subjects, sympathetic blockade did not significantly modify plasma lipoproteins. In the three patient groups, significant correlations (r = 0.62 - 0.88; P less than 0.05 - less than 0.001) existed between (a) basal plasma NE and total C or LDL + VLDL-C and (b) debrisoquine-induced changes in NE and changes in total LDL + VLDL-C. These findings suggest that in essential hypertension as well as in hemodialysis patients, the atherogenic C fraction, represented by LDL + VLDL-C, may be modulated by the noradrenergic activity.

12451241|t|Risk for tumor and other disease transmission by transplantation: a population-based study of unrecognized malignancies and other diseases in organ donors.
12451241|a|BACKGROUND: Organ donation may involve the risk of transmittal of unwanted host factors such as infections and malignancy. These may be concealed in the emergent donation process. It may be unavoidable if first observed in a donor postmortem. A number of reports on transferred cancers have been published, but quantification of the risk has never been reliably performed. We report here the first population-based analysis of unrecognized malignancies and other diseases in cadaveric or living-related donors and the possible consequences for the recipients. METHODS: We compiled a cohort of all organ donors through 27 years (1969-1996) in one single kidney transplant center covering a population on one million people. This cohort was linked to the Danish Cancer Registry, the Danish National Hospital Register, and the Danish Register of Causes of Death by means of the unique personal identification number, and all cancers, diagnosis from hospital admissions, and causes of death were identified. Follow-up was to the end of 1996. RESULTS: A total of 626 donors (491 cadaveric and 135 living-related donors) was included in the study. Ten carcinoma in situ or dysplasia cervix uteri (by definition nonmalignant), and 13 malignant tumors (5 of these were detected in living-related donors after donation) were detected by linkage to the cancer registry. All together, 17 recipients received organs from donors with carcinoma in situ or dysplasia cervix uteri and 20 from donors with malignancies. Two recipients from organ donors with carcinoma in situ or dysplasia of the cervix uteri and two recipients from donors with malignancies had a cancer detected; however, these were likely unrelated. One died 1 year after transplantation from a melanoma transmitted from the donor. Two cadaveric donors had previous admissions for glomerulonephritis, five for pyelonephritis, five for nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis, four for cystitis, and one for hydronephrosis. CONCLUSION: Despite all efforts to secure a safe organ for transplantation, transmission of donor malignancy and other diseases nevertheless can happen, as is recorded many times in the literature. We have quantified the risk using the population-based cancer registry and found a risk of 8 in 626 (1.3%) for having a donor with undetected malignancy and a risk of 1 in 626 (0.2%) for transmitting a cancer. The risk for getting some transmitted glomerulonephritis is 2 in 626 (0.3%). None of the donors with cerebral malignancies transmitted any tumors to the recipients. Compared with the benefits of organ transplantation, these risks are small; however, if time allows, a search for additional medical information from registries could further minimize the risk of transmission of malignancies or other diseases. However, this requires updated, accurate, and accessible registries and legislation that allows access to personal data and transmission of such data across administrative borders.

1997028|a|A 1989 cross-sectional substance abuse survey of 260 former anesthesiology residents of the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) during the previous 30 years yielded 183 responses (70.3%). Over three-fourths (77.2%) of those who responded reported that they had used alcohol when they were residents; 20.0% had used marijuana; and 15.7% had used cocaine. Forty-three of the 178 respondents had used unprescribed psychoactive drugs. Twenty-nine (15.8%) had been self-admitted problematic substance abusers during their residencies: 23, alcohol dependent and six, drug dependent; among the latter were four with a dual (alcohol and drug) dependency. More than 85% considered the drug policy information available during their residencies had been inadequate; institutional drug-control policies were rated "fair-to-poor" by more than 70%. Thirty-five of the residents had observed their teachers using alcohol and/or other drugs to the detriment of their teaching; approximately one-third of these infractions had gone unreported.

15100364|t|Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibition protects the kidney from hypertension-induced damage.
15100364|a|Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) have antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory properties and play a role in the maintenance of renal vascular function. A novel approach to increase EET levels is to inhibit epoxide hydrolase enzymes that are responsible for conversion of biologically active EET to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHET). We hypothesized that soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH) inhibition would improve renal vascular function and ameliorate hypertension induced renal damage. Chronic administration of the specific SEH inhibitor 1-cyclohexyl-3-dodecylurea (CDU, 3 mg/d) for 10 d lowered BP in angiotensin hypertensive rats. The contribution of renal vascular SEH to afferent arteriolar function in angiotensin hypertension was also assessed. SEH protein expression was increased in renal microvessels from hypertensive rats. Although CDU did not change afferent arteriolar responsiveness to angiotensin in normotensive animals, CDU treatment significantly attenuated afferent arteriolar diameter responses to angiotensin in hypertensive kidneys from 51% +/- 8% to 28% +/- 7%. Protection of the renal vasculature and glomerulus during chronic CDU administration was demonstrated by histology. Urinary albumin excretion, an index of renal damage, was also lower in CDU-treated hypertensive rats. These data demonstrate that SEH inhibition has antihypertensive and renal vascular protective effects in angiotensin hypertension and suggests that SEH inhibitors may be a useful therapeutic intervention for cardiovascular diseases.

15247262|t|Human BACE forms dimers and colocalizes with APP.
15247262|a|Beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) is a membrane-bound aspartyl protease with no strict primary preference for cleavage. The molecular mechanisms that link the gamma-secretase multicomponent amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing complex to biochemical properties of BACE generating the N terminus of the amyloid beta-peptide have not, as yet, been identified. We found that in human brain tissue, BACE occurred as a dimer. The overall stability of the BACE homodimer was based on intermolecular interactions that were not affected by high salt, nonionic detergents or reducing conditions. BACE homodimers could only partially be separated even under strong denaturing conditions and revealed dramatic differences in the surface charge distribution compared with the monomer. In contrast, the soluble ectodomain of truncated BACE revealed a seemingly lower avidity to the prototypic aspartate protease inhibitor pepstatin and exclusively occurred in the monomeric form. Immunocytochemical studies colocalized APP and BACE in the plasma membrane of cells expressing endogenous levels of BACE and overexpressing APP. In cells that were cotransfected with APP and a putative active site D289A mutant of BACE, colocalization persisted. Remaining enzyme activity was found to be attributable to the mutant protease. Accordingly, inactivation of the carboxyl-terminal active site motif of BACE without an impairment of overall enzyme activity suggests that the enzyme may act as a dimer. Thus, homodimerization of BACE may help the enzyme to acquire specific mechanisms to associate with its substrates to exert catalytic activity.

14756544|t|Prognostic value of p53 and MDM2 expression in bilharziasis-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.
14756544|a|The aim of this study was to elucidate the associations between immunostaining for MDM2 and p53, their respective expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, and the value of these variables for predicting treatment outcome after cystectomy. Inactivation of TP53 might play a role in the development and progression of bladder cancer. Complex formation with the MDM2 product is one mechanism that inactivates the p53 protein. Therefore, the MDM2 and the p53 protein were investigated to study potential interactions in bladder cancer. Fifty archival bladder tissue specimens were immunohistochemically stained using monoclonal antibodies against p53 and MDM2. Staining for p53 was observed in 48% of the specimens and staining for MDM2 in 20%. Univariate analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between p53 accumulation and survival (p = 0.0101), while the correlation between MDM2 and survival was not significant (p = 0.7183). The combined expression of MDM2 and p53 doest not add to the prognostic information provided by p53 alone.

8216706|t|Failure of acyclovir to prevent cytomegalovirus infection in renal allograft recipients.
8216706|a|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common opportunistic pathogen following renal transplantation and remains a major concern in transplantation centers owing to its high morbidity and impact on renal allografts. Pending more effective antiviral drugs, efforts have been directed toward prevention strategies. We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the efficacy of various prophylactic options used at our institution during the period April 1986 to August 1990. All CMV-negative patients with CMV-negative kidneys (D-R-) received screened, CMV-negative blood products (n = 19). CMV-specific immunoglobulins (CMV Ig) were used in 6 patients at increased risk for primary CMV infection and acyclovir was administered to 21 patients at an initial intravenous dose of 5 mg/kg body weight; then oral doses of 800-3200 mg per day were given according to the patients' estimated creatinine clearance. Thirty-two patients did not receive any CMV prophylactic treatment and served as controls. CMV monitoring of the patients during the first 6 months after transplantation showed an overall infection and disease rate of 81% and 38.1%, respectively, in the acyclovir-treated group. Compared with controls, the incidences of infection and disease were higher in the acyclovir-treated patients, with a significant difference for CMV infection (P = 0.002, generalized Wilcoxon test). Only 1 of the 19 D-R- patients presented with CMV infection. CMV Ig-treated patients tended to have less severe disease without any apparent reduction in infection incidence. Given the high rate of infection in patients at risk, we infer that high-dose acyclovir does not prevent CMV infection in our setting of renal transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

8332992|t|Immunization against Echis ocellatus (carpet viper) venom using liposomes incorporating immunostimulants: role of lipopolysaccharide in conferring protection in a mouse model.
8332992|a|Varying doses of whole West African Echis ocellatus venom were incorporated, with or without immunostimulants, into membrane-stabilized reverse phase evaporation (REV) liposomes. Preparations were given either subcutaneously (s.c.) or intravenously (i.v.) to mice and the immune responses compared. Addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased the venom antibody response. Lipid A produced a less pronounced and less sustained effect and the addition of muramyl dipeptide analogues made no significant contribution to the antibody response. The protective ability of circulating venom antibodies was assessed by challenging the immunized mice with a minimum lethal dose of whole venom after 175 days. A dose of 250 micrograms E. ocellatus venom + 300 micrograms LPS in REVs injected s.c. conferred the highest protection against lethal venom effects. Orally administered venom/liposomes incorporated with the mucosal adjuvant avridine primed the antibody response and produced a classic secondary response following a sublethal boost of whole venom. Single injections of venom or venom fraction/liposome preparations which produce a high and sustained immune response have potential in commercial antivenom production and in active immunization of man in areas of high snakebite incidence and mortality.

7627806|t|Type 1 interferon as an antiinflammatory agent: inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta and induction of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.
7627806|a|The effect of two type 1 interferons (r-metIFN-con1 and IFN-alpha 2b) on the induction of specific cytokines and IL-1Ra in whole blood was examined. IFN-gamma was induced at low levels following treatment of diluted whole blood in some but not all subjects. IL-1Ra was induced by both r-metIFN-con1 and IFN-alpha 2b, but with 10- to 100-fold higher induction per ng IFN with r-metIFN-con1 than with IFN-alpha 2b. There was no detectable induction of TNF-alpha, IL-4, or IL-6 by either IFN. The effect of both IFN preparations was measured on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines. Both IFN preparations inhibited the production of IL-1 beta when added to the diluted blood samples before LPS addition. However, neither IFN had any effect on IL-1 beta synthesis when added at the same time or after LPS induction. When added to total blood cells in the absence of LPS at low concentration (up to 100 pg/ml), IFN slightly stimulated IL-1 beta production, but at 1000 pg/ml or greater there was significant inhibition of IL-1 beta production. These results suggest that type I IFNs play a role in regulating the inflammatory response.

8556449|t|[Effects of substituted dextran on reinnervation of a skeletal muscle in adult rats during regeneration]
8556449|a|RGTA11 is a chemically substituted dextran that mimics some of the properties of heparin or heparan sulphates towards heparin binding growth factors as well as inhibits some heparin binding proteases. In vivo RGTA11 has been shown to enhance muscle regeneration after crush. We now present evidence that RGTA11 can alos favour reinnervation of fast (EDL) as well as slow (soleus) crushed muscles. Both types of muscles were injected with RGTA11 after crushing and nerve cutting. In EDL muscles, after 16 days, motor end plates were more rapidly reformed and choline acetyl-transferase activity was 2 fold higher than in controls. In soleus muscles, after 16 days, motor end plates were reformed at normal size while controls were on average 30% smaller, the 16S form of acetyl-cholinesterase and choline acetyl-transferase activity were twice those of non injected regenerating controls. In conclusion, RGTA11 favours axonal growth and synaptic differentiation, allowing a more rapid reinnervation and maturation of the regenerated fibers. RGTA may present a new family of drugs against neuromuscular degenerescence.

3135364|t|13CO2 breath test using naturally 13C-enriched lactose for detection of lactase deficiency in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.
3135364|a|A 13CO2 breath test using naturally enriched 13C-lactose as a substrate was performed in 47 patients with chronic abdominal pain or chronic diarrhea, taken from a population with a low prevalence of primary acquired lactase deficiency. The cumulative 13CO2 excretion 4 hours after 13C-lactose intake was compared with the H2 breath excretion and with jejunal lactase activity. A physiologically significant relation was found between the cumulative 13CO2 excretion (at 4 hours) and lactase activity, 14.5% 13CO2 excretion being the best cutoff point for discrimination between patients with low and normal lactase activity. The 13CO2 breath test was found to be more sensitive (0.84 versus 0.68) and more specific (0.96 versus 0.89) than the H2 breath test in detecting low jejunal lactase activity. Concordant results of both breath tests performed simultaneously give a reliable picture of the lactose absorption status of the patient. Discordance in results of 13CO2 and H2 lactose breath tests, if not explained by history, indicates in which patients a jejunal biopsy should be performed. If lactase activity and morphology of the biopsy are normal, other causes of discordance must be investigated.

1676835|a|Morphological changes in cultured astrocytes exposed to L-glutamate (Glu) were examined light and electron microscopically. The treatment with 0.1 mM Glu for 60 min caused marked swelling of the cells, which was characterized by reduction in staining of cytoplasm with Toluidine blue, disappearance of the cytoplasmic granular ground substances, swollen mitochondrion and nucleus, and dispersed chromatin. The above changes were prevented by the removal of Na+, Ca2+ or Cl- from the incubation medium for Glu treatment. However, the Glu treatment in a Cl(-)-free medium caused conspicuous aggregation of 10 nm filaments.

8642563|t|Discovery of novel, non-peptide HIV-1 protease inhibitors by pharmacophore searching.
8642563|a|Fifteen novel non-peptide HIV-1 protease inhibitors were identified by flexible 3D database pharmacophore searching of the NCI DIS 3D database. The pharmacophore query used in the search was derived directly from the X-ray determined structures of protease/inhibitor complexes. These 15 inhibitors, belonging to nine different chemical classes, are promising leads for further development. The two best inhibitors found, NSC 32180, a "dimer" of 4-hydroxycoumarin, and NSC 117027, a "tetramer" of 2-hydroxy quinone, had ID50 values of 0.32 and 0.75 microM for HIV-1 protease inhibition, respectively, and two other inhibitors had ID50 values close to 1 microM. Among the potent inhibitors, NSC 158393 not only demonstrated activity against HIV-1 protease (ID50 1.7 microM) but also exhibited promising antiviral activity in HIV-1-infected CEM-SS cells (EC50 = 11.5 microM). Validation of the pharmacophore used in the search was accomplished by conformational analysis. The binding modes of the most potent inhibitor found in our studies, NSC 32180, were predicted employing docking and molecular dynamics techniques.

2388522|t|The effect of cellular glucoprivation on skin temperature regulation in the rat.
2388522|a|Studies were undertaken to determine the effects of cellular glucoprivation on temperature responses in morphine-addicted and placebo-treated rats and to compare these responses to those observed during naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. Naloxone caused a tail skin temperature (TST) response of 5.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C in morphine-dependent rats. Intraperitoneal administration 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) caused TST responses in placebo-treated and morphine-dependent rats of 4.8 +/- 0.6 and 6.2 +/- 0.5 degrees C, respectively. These data indicate that the activation of the sympathetic nervous system by cellular glucoprivation causes a TST response which is equivalent in magnitude to that induced by precipitating withdrawal with naloxone. This effect of 2DG appears to be mediated by the brain, since icy administration of 2DG caused a TST response, similar to that induced by naloxone treatment of morphine-dependent rats. Collectively, these data suggest that a TST increase is a component of the response of rats to local brain glucoprivation induced by 2DG.

17114055|t|Modular organization of finger movements by the human central nervous system.
17114055|a|The motor system may generate automated movements, such as walking, by combining modular spinal motor synergies. However, it remains unknown whether a modular neuronal architecture is sufficient to generate the unique flexibility of human finger movements, which rely on cortical structures. Here we show that finger movements evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex reproduced distinctive features of the spatial representation of voluntary movements as identified in previous neuroimaging studies, consistent with naturalistic activation of neuronal elements. Principal component analysis revealed that the dimensionality of TMS-evoked movements was low. Principal components extracted from TMS-induced finger movements resembled those derived from end-postures of voluntary movements performed to grasp imagined objects, and a small subset of them was sufficient to reconstruct these movements with remarkable fidelity. The motor system may coordinate even the most dexterous movements by using a modular architecture involving cortical components.

Keep in mind that, with children, symptoms suggestive of OCD may simply indicate developmentally appropriate rituals. Become familiar with the alternative methods of assessment to facilitate evaluation in your particular office setting. Consider OCD when a patient exhibits or complains of intrusive thoughts, anxiety-based avoidance of places or objects, excessive reassurance-seeking, or repetitive behaviors/rituals (B).

1924859|t|Clonal variation of DNA repair in a human glioma cell line.
1924859|a|Clonal heterogeneity in response to ionizing radiation was found for a human glioma cell line, IN859. We have investigated the most sensitive clone, the most resistant clone and the parent line for differences in DNA repair fidelity using the method of plasmid reconstitution. Significant differences in repair fidelity were found between the two clones, and between the sensitive clone and the parent line. The resistant clone and the parent line showed the greater repair fidelity. A comparison of two different restriction enzymes, which cleave the plasmid with blunt or cohesive-ended double-strand breaks, did not reveal differences in repair fidelity. Equal numbers of plasmids were integrated in each cell line, but the sensitive clone showed a higher frequency of misrepair of cleaved plasmid. Misrepair was characterized by partial or complete loss of sequence at the site of plasmid cleavage. We conclude that the radiosensitive clone exhibits increased misrepair.

2001071|t|Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor in the adult respiratory distress syndrome.
2001071|a|The purpose of the study was to evaluate the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in critically ill patients. An immunoradiometric assay with an upper normal limit of 9 pg/ml was used to measure plasma TNF alpha levels (pl-TNF alpha) in 34 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in 16 patients in whom, despite the presence of risk factors, ARDS did not develop. Pl-TNF alpha was elevated in 76% of the patients with ARDS (71 +/- 104 pg/ml) and in 48% of the at-risk patients (47 +/- 73 pg/ml); the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. In 13 patients studied serially from the onset (Day 0) to the fifth day of ARDS, the peak pl-TNF alpha occurred later than Day 0 in seven subjects. Although the highest pl-TNF alpha levels were found in septic patients, moderately elevated values were also observed in 56% of nonseptic subjects. We conclude that plasma TNF alpha level is not a marker of ARDS but rather of shock and sepsis. These results do not exclude a pathogenic role of TNF alpha in acute lung injury since this cytokine could be produced and exert its effects within the lungs. The large incidence of abnormally high could be produced and exert its effects within the lungs. The large incidence of abnormally high plasma TNF alpha levels raises important questions on the role of this toxic cytokine in other disorders occurring in critically ill patients.

3048372|t|Maternal blood viscosity and uteroplacental blood flow velocity waveforms in normal and complicated pregnancies.
3048372|a|According to the Poiseuille-Hagen law, viscosity influences flow resistance. A possible effect of blood viscosity upon the resistance index of the uteroplacental circulation as measured by continuous wave Doppler ultrasound was investigated in 50 pregnant women. It was found that blood viscosity variables explained only about 10% of the variation in the resistance index in all patients, which was not statistically significant. It is suggested, therefore, that the vascular contribution to flow resistance may be more important.

10576641|t|Development of postural adjustments during reaching in infants with CP.
10576641|a|The development of postural adjustments during reaching movements was longitudinally studied in seven infants with cerebral palsy (CP) between 4 and 18 months of age. Five infants developed spastic hemiplegia, one spastic tetraplegia, and one spastic tetraplegia with athetosis. Each assessment consisted of a simultaneous recording of video data and surface EMGs of arm, neck, trunk, and leg muscles during reaching in various lying and sitting positions. The basic organization of postural adjustments of the children developing spastic CP was intact. Their main problem was a deficient capacity to modulate the postural adjustments to task-specific constraints - a deficit which was attributed to a combination of an impaired motor coordination and deficits in sensory integration. The child with spastic-dyskinetic CP showed distinct abnormalities in the basic organization of postural adjustments.

18564153|t|The anatomy of the distal vagina: towards unity.
18564153|a|INTRODUCTION: Factual presentations of sexual anatomy are required for educational purposes, for clinical and more general communication about sexual matters. To date, unambiguous, accurate and objective images with appropriate labeling to enhance specificity in communication have been lacking. AIM: The aim of this presentation is to provide a comprehensive overview of anatomy of the distal vagina. We aim to simplify the anatomy to reduce the confusion of historical descriptions. In doing so, we aim to avoid sacrificing any of the specific detail. This would aid communication between clinicians, researchers, and the nonclinician regarding this anatomy. OUTCOME MEASURES AND METHODS: This article reviews the historical and current anatomical literature. Systematic dissection and photography, histological study, and magnetic resonance imaging have been used as the basis for this presentation. Digital technology has been used to label, color, and highlight photography to provide clarity and permit diagramatization of photography. No distortion has otherwise been used in presenting images from cadavers or anatomical research. RESULTS: The anatomy of the distal vagina and surrounding structures is shown and described in detailed. The distal vagina, clitoris, and urethra form an integrated entity covered superficially by the vulval skin and its epithelial features. These parts have a shared vasculature and nerve supply and during sexual stimulation respond as a unit though the responses are not uniform. CONCLUSIONS: Significant progress has been made in the field of female sexual anatomy and its pictorial representation. This may facilitate further progress in the related fields of female sexual health and education.

7370284|t|Measurement of the binding of colipase to a triacylglycerol substrate.
7370284|a|The binding between colipase and two triacylglycerol substrates, tributyrin and Intralipid, in the presence of bile salts have been determined quantitatively by a method based on equilibrium partition in an aqueous two-phase system. In the model proposed the triacylglycerol, in the form of spherical droplets covered with bile salt, is assumed to have a certain number of independent binding sites at the surface for colipase. The binding of colipase to tributyrin at pH 7.0 in the presence of 4 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate and 150 mM NaCl had a dissociation constant Kd = 3.3 . 10(-7) M; the concentration of binding sites was 1.2 . 10(-6) M in a 102 mM tributyrin emulsion. When tributyrin was dispersed in 1 mM and 12 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate the dissociation constant was somewhat higher, 6.3 . 10(-7) M and 6.0 . 10(-7) M, respectively. Thus the binding strength was optimal at 4 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate. At the same time the concentration of binding sites decreased from 4.1 . 10(-6) M for 1 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate to 1.4 . 10(-6) M for 12 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate. This indicated that at higher bile salt concentration the bile salt acted as non-competitive inhibitors on the binding of colipase to the substrate, thus binding to other sites than colipase to the substrate. The binding of colipase to Intralipid, an emulsion of a long-chain triacylglycerol stabilized with phosphatidylcholine and glycerol, was more complex with indications of several different binding sites with different affinity. The majority of these had a dissociation constant Kd = 1.2 . 10(-6) M in the presence of 4 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate and 150 mM. With each droplet having a diameter of 10(-4) cm, the number of binding sites on each droplet was determined to 1.96 . 10(5) and the average area available for each colipase molecule to 1600 A at saturation. Colipase on denaturation has a surface of 1320 A.

14698849|t|Opposite effects of IFN beta on cytokine homeostasis in LPS- and T cell contact-activated human monocytes.
14698849|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease improved by interferon-beta (IFNbeta) therapy. IFNbeta may owe its anti-inflammatory property to its ability to induce interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) without triggering IL-1beta synthesis in human monocytes. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that IFNbeta inhibits the production of IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in human monocytes activated by cellular contact with stimulated T cells, a mechanism which we suspected of playing an important part in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases including MS. Here we compare modulatory effects of IFNbeta on the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-1alpha, TNF, and IL-6) and IL-1Ra in human monocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and isolated plasma membranes of stimulated T cells (msHUT), which are likely to reflect monocyte activation in acute and chronic inflammation, respectively. In monocytes activated by either LPS or msHUT, IFNbeta did not modulate the secretion of IL-1alpha and IL-6, but it enhanced the production of IL-1Ra in a dose-dependent manner. However, in monocytes activated by msHUT, the expression of cell-associated and intracellular IL-1alpha was inhibited by IFNbeta, correlating with the inhibition of IL-1alpha transcript. IFNbeta inhibited the expression (mRNA) and production (protein) of IL-1beta and TNF, while enhancing those of IL-1Ra in monocytes activated by msHUT. In contrast, in monocytes activated by LPS, IFNbeta enhanced the expression and production of IL-1beta, TNF, and IL-1Ra, suggesting that it did not display anti-inflammatory properties in these conditions. This study demonstrates that IFNbeta displays opposite effects depending on the type of activation of human monocytes, suggesting that it may affect different pathogenic mechanisms in opposite ways.

10994762|t|Angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy is associated with different mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in normotensive and hypertensive mice.
10994762|a|OBJECTIVE: In addition to its haemodynamic effects, angiotensin II (AngII) is thought to contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy via its growth factor properties. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) is crucial for stimulating cardiac growth. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether the trophic effects of AngII and the AngII-induced haemodynamic load were associated with specific cardiac MAPK pathways during the development of hypertrophy. Methods The activation of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the p38 kinase was followed in the heart of normotensive and hypertensive transgenic mice with AngII-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. Secondly, we used physiological models of AngII-dependent and AngII-independent renovascular hypertension to study the activation of cardiac MAPK pathways during the development of hypertrophy. RESULTS: In normotensive transgenic animals with AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy, p38 activation is associated with the development of hypertrophy while ERK and JNK are modestly stimulated. In hypertensive transgenic mice, further activation of ERK and JNK is observed. Moreover, in the AngII-independent model of renovascular hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy, p38 is not activated while ERK and JNK are strongly stimulated. In contrast, in the AngII-dependent model, all three kinases are stimulated. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that p38 activation is preferentially associated with the direct effects of AngII on cardiac cells, whereas stimulation of ERK and JNK occurs in association with AngII-induced mechanical stress.

8280610|t|Relapse of aplastic anaemia after immunosuppressive treatment: a report from the European Bone Marrow Transplantation Group SAA Working Party.
8280610|a|This study was designed to determine the incidence of relapse and factors predictive for relapse in 719 patients with severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) after immunosuppressive treatment (IS). Patients developing myelodysplasia or acute leukaemia after IS, and patients receiving a transplant, were excluded from this analysis. Response was defined as reaching complete independence from transfusions, relapse was defined as becoming again transfusion dependent. This criteria was validated by similar figures when using other 'relapse criteria' such as drop in neutrophil or platelet counts. Of 358 patients responding to IS. 74 patients relapsed after a mean time of 778 d after treatment. The actuarial incidence of relapse is 35.2% at 14 years after IS. The risk for relapse was higher in patients responding within 120 d from IS (48%) compared to patients responding between 120 and 360 d (40%) and only 20% for slow responders (> 360 d from IS) (P < 0.00001). In multivariate analysis this factor still proved significant (P < 0.0001). The mean time between diagnosis and treatment was significantly longer in patients relapsing compared to patients who did not relapse (260 v 134 d, P = 0.037). Relapse was not predicted by the severity of the disease, age, and sex. In 39 of the 74 relapsing patients a second response could be achieved. Responses after relapse were associated in univariate analysis with early response to previous IS and early occurrence of relapse. The actuarial survival of patients not relapsing is significantly better than survival of patients relapsing (79.8% v 67.1%, P = 0.0024). However, the actuarial survival of 39 relapsing patients who responded again to IS was similar to patients not relapsing (86%) and significantly better than in 35 patients not reaching a second response after relapse (49.3%, P = 0.0015). This study indicates that relapse is a relevant problem in the treatment of aplastic anaemia, and does have an impact on overall survival. Prospective studies of immunosuppressive regimens, looking at responses, should also address this problem in the future.

17923670|t|Altered phase diagram due to a single point mutation in human gammaD-crystallin.
17923670|a|The P23T mutant of human gammaD-crystallin (HGD) is associated with cataract. We have previously investigated the solution properties of this mutant, as well as those of the closely related P23V and P23S mutants, and shown that although mutations at site 23 of HGD do not produce a significant structural change in the protein, they nevertheless profoundly alter the solubility of the protein. Remarkably, the solubility of the mutants decreases with increasing temperature, in sharp contrast to the behavior of the native protein. This inverted solubility corresponds to a strong increase in the binding energy with temperature. Here we have investigated the liquid-liquid coexistence curve and the diffusivity of the P23V mutant and find that these solution properties are unaffected by the mutation. This means that the chemical potentials in the solution phase are essentially unaltered. The apparent discrepancy between the interaction energies in the solution phase, as compared with the solid phase, is explicable in terms of highly anisotropic interprotein interactions, which are averaged out in the solution phase but are fully engaged in the solid phase.

7824813|t|Chromosome analysis in pleural effusions. Efficiency of this method in the differential diagnosis of pleural effusions.
7824813|a|Various laboratory methods are being used to acquire diagnosis in pleural effusions. However, about 20% of the effusions cannot be diagnosed reliably. Cytogenetic analysis in pleural effusion is not used routinely, although many numerical and/or structural chromosome abnormalities have been observed in malignant pleural effusions. In this study, a total of the 61 pleural effusion samples, 34 malignant which included 19 diffuse pleural malignant mesothelioma, 15 metastatic malignant pleural effusions and 27 benign, were analyzed by direct chromosome analysis method. To the findings obtained in the study, 85.3% (29/34) of the 34 patients with malignant pleural effusion had numerical and/or structural abnormalities, and 3 of them had no mitosis. The patients who had benign pleural effusion indicated no numerical and/or structural abnormalities. We have concluded that if a pleural effusion cannot be reliably differentiated by the usual laboratory methods and especially malignancy is strongly suspected, cytogenetic analysis can be used to differentiate malignant effusions from benign effusions with a small rate of error, and also it can indicate that more invasive diagnostic procedures are necessary.

7583551|t|G-->A substitution at position -75 of the apolipoprotein A-I gene promoter. Evidence against a direct effect on HDL cholesterol levels.
7583551|a|The present study sought to resolve the contradictory evidence as to whether the G-->A substitution at position -75 of the apoA-I gene promoter raises HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by examining the effect of this polymorphism in French Canadians, a relatively genetically homogeneous population. Among 308 women, carriers of the A allele displayed 12% and 10% higher mean plasma HDL-C and apoA-I concentrations, respectively, than did noncarriers. Among 345 men, no effect of the A allele was noted. The frequency distribution of HDL-C levels in women carrying the A but not the G allele appeared bimodal, with one peak corresponding to the mean of the noncarriers and a second to higher HDL-C. Thus it appears that only a subset of A alleles confers high HDL-C levels. This hypothesis was supported by data from four kindreds within which some but not all A alleles segregated with hyperalphalipoproteinemia. The data suggest that the A substitution in the apoA-I gene promoter does not directly confer high HDL-C levels but may be in linkage disequilibrium with other sequence polymorphism(s) at this locus in a subset of alleles that raise HDL-C levels.

17727249|t|Predicting melanoma metastatic potential by optical and magnetic resonance imaging.
17727249|a|Accurate prediction of tumor metastatic potential would be helpful in treatment planning and in the design of agents that modify the tumor phenotype. We report that three methods that are potentially transferable to the clinic--dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE MRI), T(1rho)-weighted imaging and low temperature fluorescence imaging (that could be performed on biopsy specimens)--distinguished between relatively indolent (A375P) and aggressive (C8161) metastatic human melanoma xenografts in nude mice, whereas T1 and T2 relaxation time measurements did not. DCE MRI data analyzed by the BOLus Enhanced Relaxation Overview (BOLERO) method in conjunction with concurrent measurements of the arterial input function yielded a blood transfer rate constant (Ktrans) which measures perfusion/permeability, that was significantly higher in the core of the indolent tumor than in the core of the aggressive tumor. Histological staining indicated that aggressive tumors had more blood vascular structure but fewer functional vascular structure than indolent tumors. Indolent tumors exhibited T(1rho), values that were significantly higher than those of aggressive tumors at spin-locking frequencies >500 Hz. The mitochondrial redox ratio, Fp/(Fp+NADH), where Fp and NADH are the fluorescence of oxidized flavoproteins and reduced pyridine nucleotides, respectively, of aggressive tumors was much higher (more oxidized) than that of indolent tumors and often showed a bimodal distribution with an oxidized core and a reduced rim. These differences observed between these two types of tumors, one indolent and one aggressive, if generalizable, would be very valuable in predicting human melanoma metastatic potential.

17397302|t|Breaking strength and elasticity of synthetic absorbable suture materials incubated in phosphate-buffered saline solution, milk, and milk contaminated with Streptococcus agalactiae.
17397302|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine in vitro effects of PBSS, milk, and bacteria-contaminated milk (BCM; contaminated by Streptococcus agalactiae) on properties of 3 synthetic absorbable suture materials. SAMPLE POPULATION: 3 types of synthetic absorbable suture materials (poliglecaprone 25, polyglycolic acid, and polydioxanone). PROCEDURES: Suture materials were tested to determine breaking strength and elasticity before (day 0) and after incubation in 3 media (PBSS, milk, and BCM) for 7, 14, and 21 days. A loop of suture material was elongated at a rate of 60 mm/min until it reached the breaking point. Tensile properties were statistically analyzed among media and incubation times. RESULTS: Incubation in milk and BCM significantly decreased breaking strength and elasticity of poliglecaprone 25, compared with results for incubation in PBSS. Incubation in BCM significantly decreased tensile properties of polyglycolic acid suture, compared with results for incubation in PBSS and milk. After incubation for 21 days, tensile properties of polydioxanone did not differ significantly among the media but were significantly decreased from values on day 0. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: On the basis of this study, poliglecaprone 25 is an inappropriate suture material for use in teat surgery.

8747678|t|Child dental fear: cause-related factors and clinical effects.
8747678|a|The relationship between child dental fear and clinical effects, and the importance of some etiological factors related to the development of dental fear in children, were studied in 3,204 urban Swedish children aged 4 to 6 and 9 to 11 yr. Information concerning child dental fear (as measured by the Dental Subscale of Children's Fear Survey Schedule), general fears, parental dental fear, parents' employment and native language was obtained through questionnaires. Data regarding dental health, behavior management problems (BMP) and modes of dental treatment were compiled from dental records. The results showed that child dental fear was associated with missing appointments and dental caries. A proportion of 27% of the children with BMP were dentally fearful, while 61% of the children with dental fear reacted with BMP. A model for stepwise regression analysis showed that general fears, maternal dental fear, and age were important etiological factors in the development of dental fear in children.

9925152|t|The cost of implementing the Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines.
9925152|a|For a clinical practice guideline to be accepted by the end-user, the system of reimbursement for the targeted service must be favorable. The National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-DOQI) Guideline recommendations were developed without primary concern for the costs of their execution. Arguably, an unfavorable financial environment and excessive mercantile behavior by providers and payers would offer a considerable hindrance to their implementation. Toward addressing these concerns, three leaders in the development of the DOQI Guidelines for the Treatment of Anemia of Chronic Renal Failure, Hemodialysis Adequacy, and Vascular Access, have evaluated the hypothesis that implementing the recommendations of the DOQI Guidelines will increase the treatment costs for dialysis providers but will effect savings in the entire end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program. Their analyses suggest that under the current reimbursement system, this assumption may be true. However, restructured global reimbursement in the ESRD program will permit financial incentives for dialysis providers and the payer to coincide.

876439|t|Renal hemodynamics in HgCl2-induced acute renal failure.
876439|a|Renal blood flow (RBF), outer cortical blood flow (OC-rbf) and inner cortical blood flow were determined by the microsphere method in water-drinking rats and chronic saline-drinking rats at 3, 12 and 24 h after injection of HgCl2, 4.7 mg/kh body weight. RFB and OC-rbf were decreased in both groups at 3 h post HgCl2 injection. Persistent reduction of OC-rbf was noted in water-drinking rats at 12 and 24 h post HgCl2 even though the total RBF returned to normal by 24 h. These parameters were normal in chronic saline-drinking rats. Despite normal RBF in water-drinking and saline-drinking rats, serum creatinines were still signigicantly elevated 24 h post HgCl2. Therefore, alterations in total renal perfusion do not entirely account for the decreased renal function that occurs under these circumstances.

16106753|t|A complete set of Escherichia coli open reading frames in mobile plasmids facilitating genetic studies.
16106753|a|To facilitate genetic studies of Escherichia coli, we constructed a complete set of mobile plasmid clones of intact open reading frames (ORFs). Their expression is strictly controlled by Ptac / lacI(q). The plasmids carrying each ORF were introduced into an F+ recA strain and stored in 96-well microtiter plates. In this way, 96 clones can be transferred simultaneously to F- bacteria using the conjugative system. This provides a convenient procedure for systematic identification of ORFs that suppress or complement mutations. We created two types of clone sets: the original set contained individual clones in 45 microtiter plates, and a second set contained pools of 48 clones stored in a single microtiter plate. Using these clone sets, we have identified 403 genes that can correct in trans the temperature-sensitive defect of cell division mutants, which would suggest multiple global regulators for bacterial cell division.

7906233|t|Lox1, an Antennapedia-class homeobox gene, is expressed during leech gangliogenesis in both transient and stable central neurons.
7906233|a|The leech homeobox gene Lox1 contains a homeodomain homologous to those of Sex combs reduced and Antennapedia of Drosophila, and to homeodomains of the vertebrate Hox groups 5 and 6. Lox1 expression was detected during late gangliogenesis in 15-20 pairs of central neurons repeated in most segments, suggesting that Lox1 may play a role in the differentiation of these cells. The monoclonal antibody Laz1-1 identified two pairs of Lox1-expressing neurons as the Bipolar cells and the L1 neurons. The L1 neurons were detected late in gangliogenesis and became stable neurons. The Bipolar cells appeared very early in gangliogenesis, extended processes in the longitudinal connective nerves, and then degenerated, suggesting that they play a role in establishing the longitudinal tracts of the central nerve cord.

8856118|t|A new type of bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists: bradykinin analogs with N-alkyl amino acids at position 2.
8856118|a|It is commonly assumed that bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists bind to a receptor site partially different from that for agonists. Thus, it is likely that there exists more than one key modification to convert bradykinin receptor agonists into antagonists. In this respect, [L-NMePhe2]-BK represents the basic structure of a new type of bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists without any replacement at position 7. This compound inhibits both in vitro bradykinin-induced contraction of the guinea pig lung strip and in vivo bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction. Furthermore, this analog shows analgesic activity, blocks in a dose-dependent manner the bradykinin-induced Ca2+ release from macrophages and inhibits at a concentration of 10(-13) M the bradykinin-induced cytokine release from mononuclear cells. Combinations with structural modifications previously performed for other B2 receptor antagonists rather reduce than enhance the potency.

16534732|t|Inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B by ursane-type triterpenes isolated from Symplocos paniculata.
16534732|a|Inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been proposed as a therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the MeOH extract of the leaves and stems of Symplocos paniculata (Thunb.) Miq. (Symplocaceae), using an in vitro PTP1B inhibitory assay, resulted in the isolation of three ursane-type triterpenes, ursolic acid (1), corosolic acid (2) and 2alpha,3alpha,19alpha,23-tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (3). Compounds 1-3 inhibited PTP1B with IC (50) values of 3.8 +/- 0.5, 7.2 +/- 0.8 and 42.1 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively. Kinetic studies suggest that 1 is a competitive inhibitor with a K(i) value of 2.0 microM, whereas 2 is a mixed-type inhibitor of PTP1B. Our results indicate that the substitution of hydroxy groups on the ursane-type triterpenes is responsible for the loss of activity, and thus 1 and 2 possessing only one or two hydroxy groups can be potential PTP1B inhibitors.

9434136|t|Phospholipid transfer protein can transform reconstituted discoidal HDL into vesicular structures.
9434136|a|The present study investigated the effect of phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) on transformation of discoidal HDL (d-HDL) to vesicular structures by using primarily KBr density gradient centrifugation, non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and electron microscopy. The incubation of reconstituted d-HDL preparations containing apo-AI with PLTP resulted in the formation of vesicular structures differing in hydrated densities and sizes. The extents of transformation were dependent upon PLTP concentrations and incubation times. Substantial transformations occurred, even with plasma concentrations of PLTP, within 4 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. After 8 h of incubation, almost 80% of d-HDL was converted to vesicular structures with a hydrated density of 1.07 g ml-1. The d-HDL-vesicle transformation appeared to be triggered by the PLTP-mediated displacement of apo-AI. This apo-AI displacement might have led to the fusion of transiently produced apo-AI deficient particles, producing thermodynamically stable vesicular structures. The cross-linking of apo-AI in d-HDL almost completely prevented d-HDL-vesicle transformation. The addition of free apo-AI to the PLTP/d-HDL incubation mixtures also greatly reduced the transformation. The conversion of smaller vesicles of density 1.07 g ml-1 to larger vesicles of density 1.05 g ml-1 also seemed to have been affected by PLTP-mediated apo-AI displacement. We described the possible implications of the transformation of d-HDL into vesicular structures in lipid and lipoprotein transport processes under physiological and pathological conditions.

9315207|t|Doppler spectrum analysis versus direct femoral artery pressure measurement for rapid assessment of aortoiliac obstruction.
9315207|a|Adequate patient selection is required to limit the clinical workload and improve the cost-effectiveness of noninvasive hemodynamic evaluation of the aortoiliac system. In a prospective blinded fashion the traditional invasive technique of direct femoral artery pressure measurements and the computerized Doppler spectrum analysis of blood flow velocities in the common femoral artery were studied. Both tests for rapid assessment of aortoiliac obstruction were compared with duplex ultrasonographic imaging, using a peak systolic velocity ratio of 2.5 to demonstrate stenoses of 50% or more. In a series of 17 consecutive patients (34 aortoiliac segments) with suspected aortoiliac obstructive disease, a good level of agreement (kappa = 0.6) was found for both methods when compared with duplex scanning. Analysis of deviations from the duplex registrations indicated an overestimation of the pathologic cases using femoral artery pressure measurements and an underestimation using Doppler spectrum analysis of blood flow velocities in the common femoral artery. Both methods were well tolerated, but femoral artery pressure measurements had a higher technical failure rate. Because of its noninvasive character and its feasibility the Doppler technique is preferred for the selection of patients for more extensive duplex sonographic investigation.

3707600|a|Metastatic migration of murine L1210 leukemia cells, sensitive and resistant to the antitumor agent L-phenylalanine mustard, from the peritoneal cavity of mice to the liver resulted in a 2-fold elevation in their GSH content. This increase in GSH was accompanied by a corresponding increase in their resistance to the drug. Cell surface binding studies with the non-penetrating disulfide, 6,6'-dithiodinicotinic acid, indicated that both tumors isolated from the liver had a greater than 5-fold elevation in surface sulfhydryls when compared to their ascitic counterparts. These results indicate a role for the hepatic microenvironment in the maintenance of tumor cell GSH, drug responsiveness, and surface sulfhydryls.

6837479|t|The contribution of the inferior endocardial cushion of the atrioventricular canal to cardiac septation and to the development of the atrioventricular valves: study in the chick embryo.
6837479|a|The contribution of the inferior endocardial cushion of the atrioventricular canal to cardiac septation and to the development of the atrioventricular valves was studied in the chick embryo by in vivo labelling techniques. The study was performed in White Leghorn chick embryos in which the dorsal cushion was labelled at stage 20-21 (Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951), when the endocardial cushions were not yet fused. The embryos were sacrificed at stage 35 (mature heart). These experiments allow us to conclude that the inferior atrioventricular cushion gives origin to: a) that part of the cardiac septum between the septal insertion of the antero-septal leaflet of the mitral valve and the fibrous ridge which is the equivalent to the human septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (atrioventricular septum); b) the region of the interatrial and the interventricular septa adjacent to the atrioventricular septum; c) the portion of the antero-septal leaflet of the mitral valve which inserts into the septum; d) the fibrous ridge corresponding to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Microdissection shows that, when they appear at stage 18, the superior and inferior endocardial cushions of the atrioventricular canal are in continuity, without boundaries, with both the interatrial and interventricular septa. Therefore, each atrioventricular orifice opens into its corresponding ventricle, there being no stage in the development of the chick embryo heart in which the atrioventricular orifices are connected to the left ventricle at the same time. The development of the atrioventricular canal is similar in the chick and human.

9927076|t|Prevalence of dental trauma in 6000 patients with facial injuries: implications for prevention.
9927076|a|OBJECTIVE: In contrast to epidemiologic studies on facial injuries reporting on dental trauma, facial bone fractures with dentoalveolar injuries, or soft tissue injuries individually, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the overall place of dental trauma in facial injuries. This was a retrospective investigation of the impact of sport, work, violence, traffic, household, and play accidents in the relationships among dental trauma, facial trauma, and other concomitant trauma. Finally, preventive considerations are discussed. STUDY DESIGN: Six thousand patients registered at the University Hospital of Innsbruck's Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery during a period of 6 years 4 months were admitted for dental trauma, facial trauma, or both. Records were analyzed for cause of injury, age, gender, monthly distribution, frequency, type of injury, and frequency of dental trauma in relation to facial injuries and concomitant injuries. RESULTS: The incidence of dental injuries with respect to the total number of facial injuries was as follows: 57.8% in play and household accidents, 50.1% in sports accidents, 38.6% in accidents at work, 35.8% in acts of violence, 34.2% in traffic accidents, and 31% in unspecified accidents. The overall incidence revealed was 48.25%. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the fact that in the mosaic of traumatic injuries, the frequencies of tooth trauma and its sequelae are underestimated and that such trauma and sequelae occur without a predictable pattern of intensity and extensiveness. Preventive approaches are the sole way to minimize the number of these injuries. Substantial progress made in treating facial and dental trauma in the last 2 decades only improves functional and esthetic outcomes among the population that has suffered dental injury.

9243086|a|The Human Genome Project has vastly facilitated the localization, identification, and characterization of disease-related genes by means of positional cloning. Application of this technique has elucidated the pathophysiology of several inheritable cardiovascular disorders and will ultimately change the clinical evaluation of and approach to these diseases. Over the next several years, efforts aimed at gene identification, DNA sequencing, correlation of genetic and physical maps, and manipulation of large segments of DNA will lead to identification of numerous candidate genes for positional analysis and will provide ample opportunity to identify the genetic abnormalities in other cardiovascular disorders. Because of the importance and clinical implications of these advances, a conceptual understanding of this methodology is essential to the practicing clinician.

7496750|t|Transcranial Doppler measurements.
7496750|a|Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) has served a useful purpose in further defining the pathophysiology of disordered cerebrovascular control after head injury. The evaluation of altered cerebrovascular responses in individual patients may be useful in their clinical management. TCD can be a clinically useful tool in the early diagnosis of a variety of complications that can occur in head-injured patients, such as vasospasm, markedly increased intracranial pressure (ICP), low cerebral perfusion pressure, carotid dissection, and disordered cerebral autoregulation. Although the TCD waveforms alone can alert clinicians to the presence of markedly increased intracranial pressure, these waveforms are not specific for predicting moderate ICP increases. Experienced interpreters can identify TCD waveforms that indicate the arrest of the cerebral circulation. Cerebral circulatory arrest can be a useful confirmatory finding in the diagnosis of brain death in questionable cases, and also can be used to shorten the observation period in those patients in whom organ donation is contemplated or discontinuation of ventilatory support and nursing care may be indicated.

15361180|t|Histopathologic parameters of prognosis in cervical cancer--a review.
15361180|a|Apart from clinical stage and lymph node status, acknowledged to be among the most powerful predictors of outcome in cervical cancer, the determination of prognosis and thereby the need for adjuvant therapy in surgically treated patients currently relies on a variety of histopathologic factors. The role of many of these is controversial. This may be because histopathology is genuinely lacking in sensitivity for predicting tumor behavior in vivo. There is, however, wide variation in histopathologic definitions and criteria. This is probably the major reason for both the lack of reproducibility in the reporting of certain factors and in their diminished value in predicting behavior. Tumor type, grade, vascular invasion, pattern of invasion, and depth are all extremely important prognostic indicators when used individually or as a part of a scoring system.

10648824|t|Stable cation coordination at a single outer pore residue defines permeation properties in Kir channels.
10648824|a|In epithelial Kir7.1 channels a non-conserved methionine in the outer pore region adjacent to the G-Y-G selectivity filter (position +2) was found to determine unique properties for permeant and blocking ions characteristic of a K(+) channel in a single-occupancy state. The monovalent cation permeability sequence of Kir7.1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes was Tl(+)>K(+)>Rb(+)NH(4)(+)>Cs(+)>Na(+)>Li(+), but the macroscopic conductance for Rb(+) was approximately 8-fold larger than for the smaller K(+) ions, and decreased approximately 40-fold with the conserved arginine at the +2 position (Kir7.1M125R). Moreover, in Kir7.1 Rb(+) restored the typical permeation properties of other multi-ion channels indicating that a stable coordination of permeant ions at the +2 position defines the initial step in the conduction pathway of Kir channels.

In the course of the investigation, EMG activity as well as the SCL was measured after a 20 min BFB or, respectively, after a myomonitor session in 20 patients and pre- and post-treatment values were compared. Results showed tendencies of decreased mean-EMG levels for both groups after the treatment sessions, with higher EMG values for the myomonitor group. There was no indication of a significant decrease in mean EMG levels over the sessions. Furthermore, an increase of the SCL during the period of treatment was observed for both groups in session I and II, while session III produced nearly stable values. No existing correlations for changes in SCL and EMG-activity could be established.

3191337|t|Quality of life after cystectomy. Comparison between patients with conduit and those with continent caecal reservoir urinary diversion.
3191337|a|A questionnaire survey was carried out to assess the quality of life of 60 patients who had undergone cystectomy because of bladder carcinoma. Urinary diversion was by a continent caecal reservoir in 20 patients and by a conduit in 40. The patients' replies showed that cystectomy could cause severe problems in all aspects of life. Diversion with a continent caecal reservoir was associated with fewer stoma-related problems and seemed to allow the patients greater freedom to continue activities such as sport, travel and social life. Sexual problems, disturbed relationships with partners and emotional and mental problems were common and did not differ between the two groups of patients. It is recommended that patients judged to be prone to mental and emotional disturbance after cystectomy should be identified pre-operatively and given extra psychological support.

1256324|a|By histochemical and histometrical methods the the effect of l-triiodothyronine on the zona glomerulosa from rat adrenal cortex was investigated. Glucose-6-phosphatedehydrogenase and 3-beta-OH-steroiddehydrogenase activities were determined in slices of adrenal cortex. No increase in activities of these enzymes was observed after treatment with l-triiodothyronine. In contrast, histometrical studies showed a significant enlargement of nuclei in the zona glomerulosa as well as in the zona fasciculata. This observation suggests enhanced secretory activity of both zones of the adrenal cortex of the rat.

7779271|a|The pharmacological effect of aqueous extract of Polygonum capitatum has been studied. The experimental results show that Polygonum capitatum markedly decreases WBC and RBC in urine of pyelonephritis mode in rats, the death rate of Escherichia coli infected mice, and the temperature of feverish rabbits. It has also been found that after oral administration of Polygonum capitatum the animal urine markedly inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, but diuretic action of the herb has not been observed.

9452292|t|High Cryptosporidium prevalences in healthy Aymara children from the northern Bolivian Altiplano.
9452292|a|The prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection was determined in four Aymara communities in the Bolivian Altiplano, between the city of La Paz and Lake Titicaca, at an altitude of 3,800-4,200 meters. Single stool specimens were randomly collected from 377 5-19-year-old students, all apparently asymptomatic. The total prevalence (31.6%) is possibly the highest reported among healthy humans (a maximum of 9.8% and 2.0% in coprologic surveys in underdeveloped and developed countries, respectively) and one of the highest even in symptomatic subjects. No significant age and sex differences were observed. Such an infection prevalence is probably related to the poor sanitation conditions, contaminated water supplies, overcrowding, and close contact with domestic animals. Continuous exposure to the parasite could be associated with protection against parasite-related symptoms in the children examined.

1164788|a|We compared two techniques for separating and evaluating serum creatine kinase isoenzymes--fluorometric agarose electrophoresis and Sephadex chromatography--in 50 patients, 25 of whom had confirmed acute myocardial infarction. In every case isoenzyme MB (heart isoenzyme) was detected with equal sensitivity by either procedure. Evidently, only the presence or absence of MB is clinically significant; none of the 25 patients without infarction had detectable MB activity in their serum. Columns connected to a continuous-flow sample line for analyses of the eluting stream without further modification produced satisfactory results.

9136474|t|The public's role in the evaluation of health care technology. The conflict over ECT.
9136474|a|The use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), controversial since its inception, offers an instructive case study on the challenge of addressing patients' perspectives in the evaluation of health care technology. Despite widespread professional acceptance of ECT, groups of former psychiatric patients have worked through the U.S. legal system to restrict and even ban ECT in the treatment of mental illness. This unusual lay participation in the regulation of health care illustrates how differing conceptions of evidence can affect the evaluation of technology. ECT provides a powerful example of the value of a more complex definition of the significant outcomes of treatment and the growing practice of outcomes assessment, especially as such research is used to shape health policy.

2333287|t|Topography of toxin-acetylcholine receptor complexes by using photoactivatable toxin derivatives.
2333287|a|We have defined the molecular environment of a snake neurotoxin interacting with the high- and low-affinity binding sites of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR). This was done by photocoupling reactions using three toxin derivatives with photoactivatable moieties on Lys-15, Lys-47, and Lys-51. Competition data showed that Lys-47 belongs to the toxin-AcChoR interacting domain whereas the other two residues are excluded from it. We first tentatively determined the threshold of covalent coupling, indicative of the proximity between the photoactivatable probes and subunits, by quantifying the coupling occurring between the same derivatives and a model compound (i.e., a toxin-specific monoclonal antibody). We then (i) quantified the coupling yields occurring when both binding sites of AcChoR were occupied by the toxin derivatives, (ii) discriminately quantified the coupling yields at the high-affinity binding site, and (iii) deduced the coupling yields at the low-affinity binding site. In the high-affinity site, the probes on Lys-15 and Lys-47 predominantly reacted with the high-affinity site of the AcChoR alpha subunit whereas the probe on Lys-51 reacted with the delta subunit. In the low-affinity site, the probe on Lys-47 predominantly reacted with the low-affinity site of the alpha chain and the beta chain whereas those on Lys-15 and Lys-51 reacted with the gamma and delta chains, respectively. A three-dimensional model showing a unique organization of AcChoR bound to two toxin molecules is presented.

11906794|t|The expression of Fos-labeled spinal neurons in response to colorectal distension is enhanced after chronic spinal cord transection in the rat.
11906794|a|The present study used Fos-like immunoreactivity to examine neuronal activation in response to colorectal distension in rats at 1 day or 30 days following spinal cord transection or sham transection. Fifty-five Wistar rats were anesthetized and an incision was made to expose the T(5) spinal segment. The dura was reflected away in all rats and a complete transection at the rostral end of the T(5) segment was given to the lesioned group. At 1 day (acute) or 30 days (chronic) post-surgery, conscious rats were subjected to a 2 h period of intermittent colorectal distension. Rats were perfused and spinal segments L(5)-S(2) were removed and processed for Fos-like immunoreactivity. Spinal cord transection alone had no effect on Fos-labeling in either acute or chronic rats. In acute rats, colorectal distension produced significant increases in Fos-labeling in the superficial and deep dorsal horn regions. In chronic rats, colorectal distension produced a three-fold increase in Fos-labeled neurons that was manifest throughout all laminar regions. These results indicate that the number of neurons expressing Fos in response to colorectal distension is much greater after a chronic spinal cord transection than after an acute transection. Since Fos is an indicator of neuronal activation, the results show that many more neurons become active in response to colorectal distension following a chronic spinal injury. This suggests that a functional reorganization of spinal circuits occurs following chronic spinal cord transection. This may ultimately result in altered visceral and somatic functions associated with spinal cord injury in humans.

8213348|t|Synthesis and release of platelet-activating factor and eicosanoids in human endothelial cells induced by different agonists.
8213348|a|Production of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and eicosanoids by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) after stimulation with different agonists has been studied. Significant amounts of PAF were measured in the cellular fraction after treatment with thrombin (2 NIHu/ml), calcium ionophore A23187 (2 microM) and histamine (100 microM) (110.3 +/- 14.3, 80.7 +/- 19.2 and 119.2 +/- 22.4 pg/10(5) cells, respectively). Only thrombin caused a partial release of PAF into the supernatant. IL-1 alpha (0.1 nM), TNF (1 nM), arachidonic acid (10 microM) and endothelin (0.1 microM) were not able to induce any PAF synthesis. High levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were found after stimulation with thrombin and calcium ionophore A23187 (8641 +/- 2575 and 6715 +/- 3340 pg/10(5) cells, respectively). Cytokines IL-1 alpha and TNF were also able to stimulate PGI2 synthesis, although to a lesser extent. PGE2 production increased after treatment with thrombin and calcium ionophore A23187 three- and two-fold, respectively. Our results confirm that stimulated HUVEC are able to synthesize PAF and eicosanoids simultaneously, the relative amounts depending upon the agonist used. None of the agonists studied showed any significant effect on 15-HETE production.

15746275|t|Partition-distance via the assignment problem.
15746275|a|MOTIVATION: Accuracy testing of various pedigree reconstruction methods requires an efficient algorithm for the calculation of distance between a known partition and its reconstruction. The currently used algorithm of Almudevar and Field takes a prohibitively long time for certain partitions and population sizes. RESULTS: We present an algorithm that very efficiently reduces the partition-distance calculation to the classic assignment problem of weighted bipartite graphs that has known polynomial-time solutions. The performance of the algorithm is tested against the Almudevar and Field partition-distance algorithm to verify the significant improvement in speed.

17253551|t|Endovascular treatment for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
17253551|a|BACKGROUND: An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (the pathological enlargement of the aorta) can develop in both men and women as they grow older. It is most commonly seen in men over the age of 65 years. Progressive aneurysm enlargement can lead to rupture and massive internal bleeding, a fatal event unless timely repair can be achieved. Despite improvements in perioperative care, mortality remains high (approximately 50%) after conventional open surgical repair. A newer minimally invasive technique, endovascular repair, has been shown to reduce early morbidity and mortality, as compared to conventional open surgery, for planned AAA repair. Emergency endovascular repair (eEVAR) has been used successfully to treat ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA), proving that it is feasible in selected patients. However, it is not yet known if eEVAR will lead to significant improvements in outcomes for these patients or indeed if it can replace conventional open repair as the preferred treatment for this lethal condition. OBJECTIVES: To compare the advantages and disadvantages of eEVAR in comparison with conventional open surgical repair for the treatment of RAAA. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their trials register (last searched October 2006) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) database (last searched Issue 4, 2006). We searched a number of electronic databases and handsearched relevant journals until March 2006 to identify studies for inclusion. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials in which patients with a confirmed ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were randomly allocated to eEVAR, or conventional open surgical repair. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies identified for potential inclusion were independently assessed for eligibility by at least two reviewers, with excluded studies further checked by the agreed arbitrators. As no randomised controlled trials were identified at present no tests of heterogeneity or sensitivity analysis were performed. MAIN RESULTS: There were no randomised controlled trials identified at present comparing eEVAR with conventional open surgical repair for the treatment of RAAA. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no high quality evidence to support the use of eEVAR in the treatment of RAAA. However, evidence from prospective controlled studies without randomisation, prospective studies, and retrospective case series suggest that eEVAR is feasible in selected patients, with outcomes comparable to best conventional open surgical repair for the treatment of RAAA . Furthermore, endovascular repair in selected patients may be associated with a trend towards reductions in blood loss, duration of intensive care treatment, and mortality.

17306041|t|Inflammatory changes in preeclampsia: current understanding of the maternal innate and adaptive immune response.
17306041|a|Preeclampsia is characterized by generalized endothelial dysfunction as a result of an inappropriate maternal immune response against the fetus. It has been postulated that the adaptive immune system plays a key role in the etiology of preeclampsia by generating a pro-inflammatory Th1 type immune reaction. In this review, recent studies on Th1 and Th2 type cytokine mapping in preeclampsia are reviewed, as well as on the sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the role of regulatory cytokines and chemokines. In addition, we discuss the possible role of Toll-like receptors of the innate immune system in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to summarize the newer concepts related to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and explain the role of the maternal immune system and the role of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines and chemokines in the pathophysiology of the disease.

8118845|t|The organization of the chemosensory system in Drosophila melanogaster: a review.
8118845|a|This review surveys the organization of the olfactory and gustatory systems in the imago and in the larva of Drosophila melanogaster, both at the sensory and the central level. Olfactory epithelia of the adult are located primarily on the third antennal segment (funiculus) and on the maxillary palps. About 200 basiconic (BS), 150 trichoid (TS) and 60 coeloconic sensilla (CS) cover the surface of the funiculus, and an additional 60 BS are located on the maxillary palps. Males possess about 30% more TS but 20% fewer BS than females. All these sensilla are multineuronal; they may be purely olfactory or multimodal with an olfactory component. Antennal and maxillary afferents converge onto approximately 35 glomeruli within the antennal lobe. These projections obey precise rules: individual fibers are glomerulus-specific, and different types of sensilla are associated with particular subsets of glomeruli. Possible functions of antennal glomeruli are discussed. In contrast to olfactory sensilla, gustatory sensilla of the imago are located at many sites, including the labellum, the pharynx, the legs, the wing margin and the female genitalia. Each of these sensory sites has its own central target. Taste sensilla are usually composed of one mechano- and three chemosensory neurons. Individual chemosensory neurons within a sensillum respond to distinct subsets of molecules and project into different central target regions. The chemosensory system of the larva is much simpler and consists essentially of three major sensillar complexes on the cephalic lobe, the dorsal, terminal and ventral organs, and a series of pharyngeal sensilla.

8207540|t|Daidzein is a more bioavailable soymilk isoflavone than is genistein in adult women.
8207540|a|Soybean isoflavones are proposed to be anticarcinogenic, but their effective doses have not been established. To study the bioavailability of soybean isoflavones for humans, 12 young adult women received single doses of 0.7, 1.3 and 2.0 mg isoflavones/kg body wt in soybean milk as part of a liquid diet. Plasma, urine and fecal isoflavones were measured by reverse-phase HPLC. Average 24-h urinary recoveries of daidzein and genistein were approximately 21% and 9%, respectively, at all three doses. Urinary recovery of daidzein was significantly greater than that of genistein (P < 0.001). Total fecal excretion of isoflavones was only 1-2% of the ingested amount. Plasma total isoflavone concentration was significantly increased to 4.4 +/- 2.5 mumol/L at 6.5 h after a dose of 2.0 mg/kg. The plasma concentrations of daidzein and genisten were approximately equal. Twenty-four hours after dosing, both plasma and urine isoflavone concentrations were nearly nil. Although soybean milk isoflavones seem to be 85% degraded in the intestine, the bioavailability, especially of daidzein, may be sufficient to exert some health-protective effects.

6317044|t|Effects of octanoate and acetate upon hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis.
6317044|a|Octanoate and N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP) cause a marked inhibition of net glucose utilization and lactate and pyruvate accumulation by hepatocytes isolated from meal-fed rats. Acetate is much less effective as an inhibitor of glycolysis. Fatty acid synthesis, as measured by tritiated water incorporation, is inhibited by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, whereas it is stimulated by 10 mM acetate and 1 mM octanoate. Stimulation of fatty acid synthesis by 1 mM octanoate, however, is lost paradoxically at higher concentrations of octanoate. Rates of fatty acid synthesis estimated by [1-14C]octanoate incorporation were consistently higher than rates calculated on the basis of tritiated water incorporation, raising the question as to which is the better index of the rate of de novo fatty acid synthesis. The effects of octanoate were studied because it was reasoned that this fatty acid should not inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase but should inhibit glycolysis and supply acetyl-CoA for lipogenesis. This was found to be the case, proving that glycolytic activity is not necessary for rapid rates of de novo fatty acid synthesis by liver.

1341610|t|Diabetes mellitus and bacteraemia: a comparative study between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
1341610|a|OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence, mortality, clinical characteristics and outcome between bacteraemias in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. METHODS: A prospective study of all adult patients with bacteraemia admitted to a large Spanish teaching hospital during six consecutive years (1984-1990); 152 were diabetics and 1488 non-diabetics. RESULTS: Rates per 1000 admissions when bacteraemic diabetic patients were compared with non-diabetics (p < 0.001) were respectively as follows: incidence 26.8/15.5, acquisition in the community 18.4/6.2, urinary tract source 8.7/2.2, and E. coli aetiology 8.9/3.4. Diabetes mellitus type II was found in 138 episodes. Glycosylated haemoglobin levels were 13 +/- 3%. Bacteraemia developed in association with hyperosmolar status in 14.5% of patients and with ketoacidosis in 5%. Patients in the diabetic group developed septic shock in 22% of the episodes, acute renal failure in 40%, superinfections in 22% and had an inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment in 6%, vs 15.6%, 20%, 11% and 25% respectively of the non-diabetic bacteraemic patients (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Overall mortality and bacteraemia-related mortality were similar in both groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the association with fatal diseases, shock and renal insufficiency negatively influenced the outcome of diabetic patients, while the nephro-urologic source and an appropriate therapy were accompanied by a better prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: A higher incidence of bacteraemia, mainly of urinary source, community-acquired, and due to E. coli was found in the diabetic patients compared to non-diabetics.

17611762|t|Localised massive tumourous xanthomatosis of the small intestine.
17611762|a|INTRODUCTION: There are various disorders of the intestine described with accumulations of vacuolated macrophages including single or multiple xanthelasmata, Wolman's disease, cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), xanthomatogranulomatotic disease and xantheloma disseminatum. CLINICAL CASE: In this paper, we report on an exceptional case of a 68-year-old male patient with a localised, massive accumulation of vacuolated, most likely lipid-loaded macrophages with an infiltrative pattern in the muscularis mucosa and propria of the small intestine leading to a tumourous mass requiring surgical removal due to impaired gut function. No enlargement of the liver or the spleen and no evidence of general abnormal lipid storage were detected elsewhere. No evidence of Wolman's or CESD was present. Also, on the ultra-structural level, the macrophages contained no cholesterol clefts typical for either Wolman's and CESD. Instead, largely empty, partly large vacuoles were seen, which most likely contained fatty acids removed during processing. DISCUSSION: The pathogenetic mechanism of the massive local accumulation of histiocytic cells in this part of the intestine in our case remains un-clear. In summary, this case demonstrates that on rare occasions histiocytic proliferations can mimic tumourous masses with severe functional impairment of the intestine and thus should be in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal motility disorders.

9537697|t|N-acetylneuraminic acids (nana): a potential key in renal calculogenesis.
9537697|a|N-Acetylneuraminic acids (NANA) promote binding of calcium ions to macromolecules and cells, increase the intrinsic viscosity of glycoproteins and facilitate gel formation in water. Since these properties are crucial in urinary calculogenesis, we evaluated NANA levels in urine and serum as well as their expression in kidney tissues. Using a modified thiobarbituric acid assay, the evaluation of free and bound NANA in 24-h urine samples revealed a ratio of 1.87 in 33 non-stone-formers but a reversed ratio of 0.84 in 41 recurrent calcium oxalate stone-formers. Time kinetics revealed a gradual rise in NANA expression until 48 h of culture and a significantly higher release into supernatants of papillary renal epithelial cells (REC) when compared with cortical REC. To examine NANA distribution in kidney tissues, paraffin-embedded biopsies from five normal and six stone-forming kidneys were labeled with the biotinylated NANA-specific lectins Maackia amurensis (MAA) and Sambucus nigra (SNA). Immunohistochemistry revealed intense luminal MAA reactivity of distal tubular REC and collecting ducts in 96.7% and 91.5% of normal and stone-forming kidneys respectively. By contrast, there was a marked difference between normal and stone-forming kidneys for SNA reactivity (17.7% vs 95%) at the same locations. Finally, the glycocalyx of recurrent stone-formers showed altered sialylglycoside linkages [alpha(2,6) instead of alpha(2,3)] that may indicate an altered REC function. Given the calcium-binding potential of NANA, their increased local concentration within the glycocalyx layer in the distal nephron may either initiate stone formation or facilitate attachment of microcrystals to REC.

18602872|t|An ontological knowledge framework for adaptive medical workflow.
18602872|a|As emerging technologies, semantic Web and SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) allow BPMS (Business Process Management System) to automate business processes that can be described as services, which in turn can be used to wrap existing enterprise applications. BPMS provides tools and methodologies to compose Web services that can be executed as business processes and monitored by BPM (Business Process Management) consoles. Ontologies are a formal declarative knowledge representation model. It provides a foundation upon which machine understandable knowledge can be obtained, and as a result, it makes machine intelligence possible. Healthcare systems can adopt these technologies to make them ubiquitous, adaptive, and intelligent, and then serve patients better. This paper presents an ontological knowledge framework that covers healthcare domains that a hospital encompasses-from the medical or administrative tasks, to hospital assets, medical insurances, patient records, drugs, and regulations. Therefore, our ontology makes our vision of personalized healthcare possible by capturing all necessary knowledge for a complex personalized healthcare scenario involving patient care, insurance policies, and drug prescriptions, and compliances. For example, our ontology facilitates a workflow management system to allow users, from physicians to administrative assistants, to manage, even create context-aware new medical workflows and execute them on-the-fly.

2670694|t|High-dose melphalan and autologous bone marrow support for treatment of ovarian carcinoma with positive second-look operation.
2670694|a|Patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (OVCA) and positive second-look operation (SLO) have a poor short-term prognosis. Treatment after SLO is still controversial and pilot studies are justified in an attempt to improve survival of these patients. As OVCA is known to be a chemosensitive tumor, it seems logical to treat these patients with high-dose chemotherapy with the support of an autologous bone marrow transplantation. Fourteen patients underwent primary surgery with tumor debulking followed by cis-platinum-based chemotherapy. SLO was performed in each patient and was microscopically positive in five and macroscopically positive with secondary debulking in nine. All patients were treated after SLO with high-dose melphalan (HDM), 140 mg/m2, and autologous bone marrow support. HDM was well tolerated, with a median time to granulocyte recovery of 21 days. There was no death due to treatment toxicity. The mean follow-up after SLO is 43 months. Five patients (35.7%) are disease free at 30 to 60 months after SLO with no further treatment and, thus, a good quality of life. Four patients are alive with recurrent disease. Five patients died of OVCA; actuarial 3-year survival is 64%. This therapeutic procedure is well tolerated and seems to provide long-term survival for patients with no complete response after first-line chemotherapy. Therefore, it might also be applied to patients at high risk of recurrence after a negative SLO.

4316376|t|The development of glyoxysomes in peanut cotyledons and maize scutella.
4316376|a|The development of glyoxysomes during germination has been studied in isolated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cotyledons and in maize (Zea mays L.) scutella. In peanut cotyledons isocitratase, malate synthetase, and protein associated with the glyoxysomal fraction increase simultaneously from the 3rd to the 8th day of incubation. In scutella of germinating maize seeds the specific activities of isocitratase, malate synthetase, and catalase associated with the glyoxysomes rise until the 4th day of germination and then decline while the total amount of protein present in the fraction stays constant during the first 5 days. If the peanut cotyledons are cultured in 2% glucose, the development of isocitratase and malate synthetase is severely inhibited, but the level of the glyoxysomal protein is not measurably affected.

9684307|t|Trans activation of the Escherichia coli ato structural genes by a regulatory protein from Bacillus megaterium: potential use in polyhydroxyalkanoate production.
9684307|a|A Bacillus megaterium genomic fragment, which encoded an activator homologous to sigma 54 regulators and which was capable of activating Escherichia coli ato genes in trans, was detected in a gene library of B. megaterium screened for beta-ketothiolase activity. The fragment presented only one complete open reading frame (ORF1), which encoded a protein of 398 amino acids. The recombinant plasmid complemented mutations in the Escherichia coli atoC regulatory gene. The constitutive expression of the E. coli ato operon mediated by ORF1 could be useful for the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates with different flexibility properties by recombinant E. coli strains.

8223481|t|Functional domains of the human splicing factor ASF/SF2.
8223481|a|The human splicing factor ASF/SF2 displays two predominant activities in in vitro splicing assays: (i) it is an essential factor apparently required for all splices and (ii) it is able to switch utilization of alternative 5' splice sites in a concentration-dependent manner. ASF/SF2 is the prototype of a family of proteins typified by the presence of one or two RNP-type RNA binding domains (RBDs) and a region highly enriched in repeating arginine-serine dipeptides (RS regions). Here we describe a functional analysis of ASF/SF2, which defines several regions essential for one, or both, of its two principal activities, and provides insights into how this type of protein functions in splicing. Two isoforms of the protein, which arise from alternative splicing, are by themselves inactive, but each can block the activity of ASF/SF2, thereby functioning as splicing repressors. Some, but not all, mutations in the RS region prevent ASF/SF2 from functioning as an essential splicing factor. However, the entire RS region can be deleted without reducing splice site switching activity, indicating that it is not absolutely required for interaction with other splicing factors. Experiments with deletion and substitution mutants reveal that the protein contains two related, but highly diverged, RBDs, and that both are essential for activity. Each RBD by itself retains the ability to bind RNA, although optimal binding requires both domains.

9521464|t|Sensory and instrument-measured ground chicken meat color.
9521464|a|Instrument values were compared to sensory perception of ground breast and thigh meat color. Different patty thicknesses (0.5, 1.5, and 2.0) and background colors (white, pink, green, and gray), previously found to cause differences in instrument-measured color, were used. Sensory descriptive analysis scores for lightness, hue, and chroma were compared to instrument-measured L* values, hue, and chroma. Sensory ordinal rank scores for lightness, redness, and yellowness were compared to instrument-generated L*, a*, and b* values. Sensory descriptive analysis scores and instrument values agreed in two of six comparisons using breast and thigh patties. They agreed when thigh hue and chroma were measured. Sensory ordinal rank scores were different from instrument color values in the ability to detect color changes caused by white, pink, green, and gray background colors. Instrument values agreed with sensory scores for lightness only when white and pink backgrounds were used. Instrument and sensory methods agreed when a* values and redness scores were compared using each of the backgrounds. The sensory panel did not detect differences in yellowness found by the instrument when samples on white and pink backgrounds were compared to samples on green and gray backgrounds. A majority of panelists (84 of 85) preferred samples on white or pink backgrounds. Red color of breast patties was associated with freshness. Reflective lighting was compared to transmission lighting using patties of different thicknesses. Sensory evaluation detected no differences in lightness due to breast patty thickness when reflective lighting was used. Increased thickness caused the patties to appear darker when transmission lighting was used. Decreased transmission lighting penetrating the sample made the patties appear more red. Reflective lighting made thigh patties appear lighter. Lightness decreased when thigh patty thickness increased with both reflective and transmission lighting. Transmission lighting made the thigh patties appear more yellow as patty thickness increased.

1784987|t|[Correction of the tip of the nose in rhinoplasty]
1784987|a|It is quite easy to significantly modify the nasal bone. In most cases, the dorsonasal skin, which is often thin and elastic, will adapt to the new osteocartilaginous frame. On the contrary, the thickness is different at the tip of the nose, where the skin is often thicker than at the dorsonasal level. Surgery should preferably be performed first on the tip of the nose, whose new shape will allow adjusting the new structure of the nasal bone.

11682595|t|Changes in driving patterns and worsening depressive symptoms among older adults.
11682595|a|OBJECTIVES: This study examined whether changes in driving patterns-driving cessation and reduction-have negative consequences for the depressive symptoms of older Americans and whether these consequences are mitigated for people with a spouse who drives. METHODS: The project used data from 3 waves of the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study. Depressive symptoms were assessed with an abbreviated Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. Using 2 models, the project examined how driving cessation and reduction that occurred between Waves 1 and 2 contributed to increases in depressive symptoms between Waves 2 and 3. The first model included the entire sample (N = 5,239), and the second model focused on drivers only (n = 3,543). A third model added interaction terms to the analysis to consider whether respondents who stopped driving but had a spouse who drove were less at risk of worsening depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Respondents who stopped driving had greater risk of worsening depressive symptoms. Drivers who restricted their driving distances before the study began also had greater risk of worsening depressive symptoms, but seemingly less so than the respondents who stopped driving altogether. For respondents who stopped driving, having a spouse available to drive them did not mitigate the risk of worsening symptoms. DISCUSSION: Changes in driving patterns can be deleterious for older people's depressive symptoms. Initiatives for assisting older people should focus on strategies that help them retain driving skills, that prepare them for the possible transition from driver to ex-driver, and that ensure that they have access to mental health therapies if driving changes are imminent.

2244671|t|Comparison of clinical significance and allergenic cross-reactivity of storage mites Blomia kulagini and Lepidoglyphus destructor in Sweden and Brazil.
2244671|a|Comparison of the clinical significance and allergenic cross-reactivity of Blomia kulagini (B. kulagini) and Lepidoglyphus destructor (L. destructor) was made on sera from Sweden and Brazil using the radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST) and the RAST inhibition technique. RAST-positive sera were obtained from 53 allergic Swedish farmers and 31 allergic subjects from Brazil who were positive to B. kulagini and/or L. destructor. B. kulagini was shown to be a common cause of sensitization especially in Brazil. There was a fairly high correlation between positive RAST results to L. destructor and B. kulagini based on sera from both Sweden and Brazil. The highest RAST scores were found against L. destructor in Swedish sera and against B. kulagini in Brazilian sera. The RAST inhibition studies showed that the L. destructor extract was able to inhibit the B. kulagini system (a positive RAST to B. kulagini allergen disc) in Swedish but not in Brazilian sera. In contrast, the B. kulagini extract was only able to inhibit the L. destructor system in sera from Brazil and not in sera from Sweden. This study shows that results obtained with RAST inhibition are not entirely dependent on the overall specificity of the IgE antibodies in the patient's sera, since the more subtle specificity of the primarily sensitizing allergen will dominate. Thus, conclusions drawn regarding allergenic cross-reactivity are dependent on the populations tested, and conclusions on the existence or absence of cross-reactivity, e.g. between two species of mites may be contradictory.

15013332|t|Plasma homocysteine levels in renal transplant patients on tacrolimus therapy.
15013332|a|Increased plasma total homocysteine levels afford an independent risk factor to assess cardiovascular morbidity in patients with normal and impaired renal function, including stable transplant recipients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate plasma homocysteine levels and factors known to influence homocysteine metabolism (folate and Vitamin B(12)) in renal transplanted patients treated with tacrolimus. Plasma homocysteine, serum folate and serum vitamin B(12) concentrations were measured in 18 cadaveric renal transplant patients with stable function both before and 3 months after the renal transplantation. While the mean plasma homocysteine level in the renal transplant group was significantly higher than in the control group, no significant change was observed following renal transplantation under tacrolimus therapy (16.84 +/- 6.43 micromol/L vs 16.02 +/- 6.54 micromol/L). The levels of folate before and after transplantation were considerably lower than the control group; a significant effect of tacrolimus has not been observed (7.32 +/- 4.68 ng/mL and 7.55 +/- 5.20 ng/mL). Serum vitamin B(12) levels in the transplant group were significantly lower than the control group; a significant decline was seen 3 months after the renal transplantation (448.94 +/- 230.03 pg/mL vs 334.38 +/- 240.61 pg/mL). Consequently, although plasma homocysteine levels of renal transplant recipients are higher, a lowering effect of tacrolimus therapy was not observed on plasma homocysteine levels. The lower levels of folate and Vitamin B(12) in the transplant group compared to a control group supports therapy with folate and Vitamin B(12) to decrease homocysteine concentrations.

16690780|t|Wnt signaling regulates the invasion capacity of human mesenchymal stem cells.
16690780|a|Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) exhibit the potential to contribute to a wide variety of endogenous organ tissue repair. However, the signals governing hMSC mobilization out of the bone marrow, release into the bloodstream, and migration/invasion into the target tissue are largely unknown. Since canonical Wnt signaling regulates not only tumor but also various stem cell attributes, we hypothesized that this signal transduction pathway might also be involved in governing the transmigration of hMSCs through human extracellular matrix (ECM). Stimulation of hMSCs with recombinant Wnt3a or LiCl resulted in the accumulation of the transcriptional activator beta-catenin, its translocation into the nucleus, and the upregulation of typical Wnt target genes such as cyclin D1 and membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MT1-MMP). Moreover, both stimuli significantly enhanced hMSC proliferation up to 40%. In addition, an increase of more than twofold in the ability of hMSCs to transmigrate through Transwell filters coated with human ECM was observed. In a reverse approach, Wnt signaling in hMSCs was inhibited by knocking down the expression of either beta-catenin or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 using RNA interference technology. These inhibition strategies resulted in downregulation of the Wnt target genes cyclin D1 and MT1-MMP, in a reduced proliferation rate, and in a strikingly diminished invasion capacity (64% and 52%). Taken together, this study provides for the first time decisive evidence that canonical Wnt signaling is critically involved in the regulation of the proliferation, as well as of the migration/invasion capacity of hMSCs, representing essential stem cell features indispensable during tissue regeneration processes.

10355639|t|Relaxed versus activated stump muscles during casting for trans-tibial prostheses.
10355639|a|In prosthetic practice, the question often arises as to whether the hand cast should be made from a contracted or from a non-contracted amputation stump. To elucidate this question, the authors have performed a study to quantify the volume difference between these 2 conditions, and to relate the differences to prosthetic fitting. Sixteen (16) trans-tibial amputees participated in the study. All of them were fitted with an ICEROSS silicone socket. Electromyographic studies, with electrodes attached to the anterior tibial and medial gastrocnemius muscles, were carried out to determine muscle contraction levels. Volume determinations were made with the CAPOD laser scanning system. Measurements were performed with and without the silicone liner on the stump. Without a silicone liner, the volume of the stump increased by 5.8% (SD=5.3) as the muscles contracted. This increase was statistically significant. With the liner donned the volume increased 3.5% (SD=3.3). This increase was also statistically significant. The volume of the prosthetic socket was also compared with the stump volume with a silicone liner on. For the relaxed stump, the difference was 1.8% (SD=10.1), and for the contracted stump -1.7% (SD=11.3). Neither difference was statistically significant. The importance of these volume changes and how they influence stiffness of the coupling between the stump and the socket are discussed. It is concluded, that the observed difference in volume between a contracted and a non-contracted stump are large enough to be considered by the prosthetist in his decision on how to make a hand cast.

7504939|t|Effect of cadmium on enzymatic digestion and sugar transport in the small intestine of rabbit.
7504939|a|Cadmium compounds are found widely in our environment: for example, in food, water, soil, and ambient air. The most important exposure route of animals to cadmium in the general environment is via oral exposure. In oral cadmium intoxication, the immediate target organ is the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of the present work was to determine how cadmium acts on the intestinal absorption of sugars and on the sucrase activity through rabbit jejunum, after in vitro administration and/or oral administration of CdCl2 in drinking water. Results obtained show that cadmium decreases D-galactose accumulation in the jejunum tissue. This effect seems to be the results of an action mainly located on Na(+)-dependent sugar transport of the mucosal border of the intestinal epithelium, because cadmium seems not to modify the sugar diffusion across the intestinal epithelium. Cadmium has also been shown to inhibit the (Na(+)-K+)-ATPase activity of the enterocyte, which might explain the inhibition of the D-galactose Na(+)-dependent transport. Nevertheless, a direct action of the cadmium molecule on the Na(+)-dependent carrier cannot be discarded. Cadmium altered the sucrose activity when it was administered in the drinking water for 4 d.

10321713|t|Toxicity measurement of orthopedic implant alloy degradation products using a bioluminescent bacterial assay.
10321713|a|The toxicity of aqueous metal solutions representative of ionic degradation products from orthopedic implant alloys was determined using a bacterial bioluminescence assay, Microtox. The toxicity of forms of the individual elements released from ASTM F75 Co-Cr-Mo (Co-Cr-Mo), F138 316L stainless steel (316L), and F136 Ti-6Al-4V (Ti-6Al-4V) was first determined, and a mathematical model was developed to predict the toxicity of mixtures of these ions. Aqueous metal solutions were then mixed according to the proportions of the ions found in these alloys, and their toxicity was measured with Microtox. Mixture behavior was classified as synergistic, antagonistic, or additive by comparing measured toxicity to predicted toxicity. Since relating these tests to actual implant corrosion processes can be confounded by selective leaching, the predicted and measured toxicity of aqueous metal solutions mixed according to proportions representative of selective leaching were next determined, and the mixture behaviors were classified as before. The most toxic individual alloying elements were found to be hexavalent Cr, Ni, and Co, in that order: a finding in accord with prior biocompatibility research. Co-Cr-Mo was found to be the most toxic alloy mixture of both those combined according to alloy composition and those combined to reflect selective leaching. The Ti-6Al-4V mixtures were found to behave synergistically, while the Co-Cr-Mo and 316L mixtures behaved antagonistically. By providing insight into degradation product toxicity and elemental interaction, these experiments demonstrate the utility of employing bioluminescent bacterial assays to investigate biocompatibility of implant materials. Further studies to more closely simulate in vivo conditions, though, are required to fully gauge their potential in this regard.

11932855|t|Comparison of knee extensor strength between limbs in individuals with bilateral total knee replacement.
11932855|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine and compare force production of the knee extensors between limbs after bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). DESIGN: Two repeated-measures designs (2 factors: limb, time) assessing for differences in strength between limbs over 3 times at 2 different testing speeds. SETTING: Private and institutional practice. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen volunteers (6 men, 8 women; mean age +/- standard deviation, 74.57 +/- 5.5 y; height, 169.91 +/- 9.43 cm; weight, 76.42 +/- 9.85 kg) with bilateral TKA. Open-chain knee extensor strength was measured in both legs before surgery and 30 and 60 days after TKA at 60 degrees /s and 180 degrees /s. INTERVENTION: Rehabilitation 3 times weekly for 8 weeks. Treatment consisted of gait, transfer training, stationary cycle work, and a progressive resistance-training program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Peak torque measured isokinetically. RESULTS: Limb by time interaction was not significant for either 60 degrees /s (F(2,26) =.75, P =.351) or 180 degrees /s (F(2,26) =.78, P =.393). A significant main effect of time was found at 60 degrees /s (F(2,26) = 14.22, P =.0001) and 180 degrees /s (F(2,26) = 10.47, P =.003). CONCLUSIONS: During the first month after TKA, bilateral knee extensor force-production decreased significantly compared with preoperative force production.

12873822|t|Effects of the CCR5-Delta32 mutation on antiviral treatment in chronic hepatitis C.
12873822|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The CC-chemokine receptor (CCR) 5-Delta32 mutation may predispose to chronic liver disease and high level viremia in hepatitis C. However, it is unclear whether CCR5-Delta32 also affects the response to antiviral treatment. METHODS: We determined CCR5 genotypes in patients with hepatitis C treated with either interferon-alpha (N=78) or interferon and ribavirin (N=78). In each group, rates of end of treatment responses (ETRs) and sustained virological responses (SVRs) were compared between CCR5-Delta32 carriers and homozygous CCR5 wildtype patients. RESULTS: ETR and SVR were achieved in 25 and 12 patients with interferon-alpha and in 52 and 45 patients with interferon/ribavirin treatment, respectively. CCR5-Delta32 carriers had significantly lower ETR rates than homozygous CCR5 wildtype patients (10.5 vs. 39.0%; P=0.02), whereas SVR rates only showed a non-significant trend (5.3 vs. 18.6%). Multivariate analysis confirmed CCR5-Delta32 carriage as an independent negative predictor for ETR in interferon-alpha monotherapy (odds ratio: 0.16; 95% confidence limits: 0.032-0.82; P=0.03). In interferon/ribavirin treated patients CCR-Delta32 carriers and CCR5 wildtype patients had similar ETR rates [19.2% vs. 23.1%] and SVR rates [20.0% vs. 21.2%]. CONCLUSIONS: Response rates to interferon-alpha monotherapy are reduced in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients carrying the CCR5-Delta32 mutation. However, interferon/ribavirin combination treatment may overcome this negative effect of CCR5-Delta32.

9578125|t|Salivary gland heterotopia in the lower neck: a report of five cases.
9578125|a|Heterotopic salivary gland tissue (HSGT) represents an uncommon lesion, usually presenting as a discharging sinus in the base of the neck. Diagnostic criteria and embryogenesis of this entity still remain unclear. For the purpose of clarifying both subjects, all lateral cervical anomalies undergoing surgery during a 12-year period were examined. Histological study showed salivary tissue in 10 out of 119 patients. However, only 5 of them accomplished HSGT criteria. This study presents the second largest series to date of undisputed HSGT in the lower neck. Both accessory glands and branchial cleft anomalies should be distinguished from this lesion. Neoplastic transformation in HSGT, although extremely rare, should also be considered.

167431|t|Antibiotic susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria by the standardized disc diffusion method with special reference to bacteroides fragilis.
167431|a|The susceptibility of 90 strains of Bacteroides fragilis to 16 antibacterial drugs was determined by the agar plate dilution test and the disc diffusion test. Good correlation of results was obtained with the two methods, and regression line analysis could be performed for beta-lactam antibiotics, erythromycin, tetracyclines, lincomycin and clindamycin. Thus the standardized disc diffusion method can be used for susceptibility testing, but only a clear distinction between sensitive and resistant strains can be seen.

15119189|t|[Effect of a corticoliberin (CRF4-6) on the rat heart rate and behavior]
15119189|a|The effects of tripeptide corticoliberin fragment CRF4-6 (Pro-Pro-Ile) on heart rate and behaviour of rats with simultaneous monitoring of these parameters in free-moving animals in their home cage were investigated. Intracerebroventriculary administered CRF4-6 (6, 30, 150 nmol) induces arousal effect increasing the duration of active behaviour, decreasing the duration of passive behaviour and sleep both. At the same time the tripeptide increases the heart rate during sleep, passive and exploratory activity. CRF4-6 (30, 150 nmol) also increases the heart rate in anaesthetised rats. All observed effects of the tripeptide are dose dependent. Taking into account these facts we suggest that CRF4-6 influences behaviour and heart activities independently.

6601977|t|Chemotactic activity of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid containing protein in bone.
6601977|a|We have found that the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (GLA)-containing protein from bone (BGP, osteocalcin) has chemotactic activity in vitro for a number of cells which are found adjacent to endosteal bone surfaces in vivo. Using the Boyden chamber technique for measuring cell chemotaxis in vitro, we have shown that BGP is chemotactic for cultured human breast cancer cells, human and mouse monocytes, and for cultured rat osteosarcoma cells which have the characteristics of osteoblasts. The migration of these cells in response to BGP is undirectional and not due to spontaneous or random migration. A synthetic peptide (Phe-Tyr-Gly-Pro-Val), which is identical to the carboxy-terminal peptide cleaved from BGP when digested by trypsin, is also chemotactic for the same cells. BGP retains its chemotactic activity after conversion of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues to glutamic acid, indicating that this biological effect requires neither gamma-carboxyglutamate nor the ability of BGP to bind calcium. Since BGP is released from bone during states of increased bone turnover, it is possible that this chemotactic effect of the protein may be a mechanism for recruitment of these cells to sites of active bone remodeling.

477319|a|Pharmacokinetics of norethindrone (NET) was evaluated in eleven women belonging to a low socio-economic group and in five womem belonging to the high socio-economic group after the administration of an oral dose of 0.35 mg NET minipill on an empty stomach. Blood samples were collected at different intervals of time over a period of 24 hours. Plasma NET was estimated by radioimmunoassay. In all women, peak levels of NET occurred within 1-2 hours and a semi-log plot of plasma NET levels showed a biexponential decline. The half-life of plasma NET clearance was relatively shorter in women of low socio-economic group with poor nutritional status as indicated by anthropometric indices, as compared to that in well nourished women of high socio-economic group. There was a significant positive correlation between weight/(height) 2x 100 index on the one hand and t1/2 (beta) on the other in all the women studied, thereby suggesting a role for nutritional status in the metabolic handling of NET.

1239385|t|The effects of chronic alcohol ingestion in mice on contractile properties of cardiac and skeletal muscle: a comparison with normal and dehydrated-malnourished controls.
1239385|a|In vitro isometric contractile tension was measured in heart and skeletal muscle in 3 groups of mice: 1. a control group, 2. a group maintained for 27 weeks on 20% alcohol, and 3. a group whose fluid intake was restricted to the extent equaling that which occurred in the alcohol treated animals. Results showed a reduction in cardiac twitch tension in both the alcohol and fluid restricted group, as compared to normal controls. We therefore consider that dehydration per se may play an important role in the etiology of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.

Access to the stomach was planned and achieved with only fluoroscopic guidance. The technical success rate was 100%. Major procedure-related complications including death, sepsis, hemorrhage, peritonitis, or early tube removal did not occur. The minor complication of local skin infection occurred in six patients. Twenty-six patients (96%) tolerated tube feedings well. Mean follow-up was 184 days, and median follow-up was 103 days. At 30 days, 26 patients (96%) were alive.

The exudate thus appears to have a major nutritional role in pollen tube growth in vivo.

7789452|t|Are arm trajectories planned in kinematic or dynamic coordinates? An adaptation study.
7789452|a|There are several invariant features of point-to-point human arm movements: trajectories tend to be straight, smooth, and have bell-shaped velocity profiles. One approach to accounting for these data is via optimization theory; a movement is specified implicitly as the optimum of a cost function, e.g., integrated jerk or torque change. Optimization models of trajectory planning, as well as models not phrased in the optimization framework, generally fall into two main groups-those specified in kinematic coordinates and those specified in dynamic coordinates. To distinguish between these two possibilities we have studied the effects of artificial visual feedback on planar two-joint arm movements. During self-paced point-to-point arm movements the visual feedback of hand position was altered so as to increase the perceived curvature of the movement. The perturbation was zero at both ends of the movement and reached a maximum at the midpoint of the movement. Cost functions specified by hand coordinate kinematics predict adaptation to increased curvature so as to reduce the visual curvature, while dynamically specified cost functions predict no adaptation in the underlying trajectory planner, provided the final goal of the movement can still be achieved. We also studied the effects of reducing the perceived curvature in transverse movements, which are normally slightly curved. Adaptation should be seen in this condition only if the desired trajectory is both specified in kinematic coordinates and actually curved. Increasing the perceived curvature of normally straight sagittal movements led to significant (P < 0.001) corrective adaptation in the curvature of the actual hand movement; the hand movement became curved, thereby reducing the visually perceived curvature. Increasing the curvature of the normally curved transverse movements produced a significant (P < 0.01) corrective adaptation; the hand movement became straighter, thereby again reducing the visually perceived curvature. When the curvature of naturally curved transverse movements was reduced, there was no significant adaptation (P > 0.05). The results of the curvature-increasing study suggest that trajectories are planned in visually based kinematic coordinates. The results of the curvature-reducing study suggest that the desired trajectory is straight in visual space. These results are incompatible with purely dynamic-based models such as the minimum torque change model. We suggest that spatial perception--as mediated by vision--plays a fundamental role in trajectory planning.

11937578|t|De novo central nervous system processing of myelin antigen is required for the initiation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
11937578|a|We demonstrate the absolute requirement for a functioning class II-restricted Ag processing pathway in the CNS for the initiation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). C57BL/6 (B6) mice deficient for the class II transactivator, which have defects in MHC class II, invariant chain (Ii), and H-2M (DM) expression, are resistant to initiation of myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) peptide, MOG(35-55)-specific EAE by both priming and adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic T cells. However, class II transactivator-deficient mice can prime a suboptimal myelin-specific CD4(+) Th1 response. Further, B6 mice individually deficient for Ii and DM are also resistant to initiation of both active and adoptive EAE. Although both Ii-deficient and DM-deficient APCs can present MOG peptide to CD4(+) T cells, neither is capable of processing and presenting the encephalitogenic peptide of intact MOG protein. This phenotype is not Ag-specific, as DM- and Ii-deficient mice are also resistant to initiation of EAE by proteolipid protein peptide PLP(178-191). Remarkably, DM-deficient mice can prime a potent peripheral Th1 response to MOG(35-55), comparable to the response seen in wild-type mice, yet maintain resistance to EAE initiation. Most striking is the demonstration that T cells from MOG(35-55)-primed DM knockout mice can adoptively transfer EAE to wild-type, but not DM-deficient, mice. Together, these data demonstrate that the inability to process antigenic peptide from intact myelin protein results in resistance to EAE and that de novo processing and presentation of myelin Ags in the CNS is absolutely required for the initiation of autoimmune demyelinating disease.

2631398|a|The ability of human observers to discriminate the direction of motion of a briefly-presented, slowly moving, 1 c/deg sinusoidal grating varies non-monotonically with the contrast of the grating. At low contrasts, performance improves with increasing contrast, but it reaches a peak between 95% and 100% correct at a contrast of 0.02-0.05. With further increases in contrast performance declines, reaching chance levels at a contrast of about 0.4. Detection of the same stimulus improves with increasing contrast to 100% correct and stays there. This behaviour would be expected if the visual signal which determines direction-of-motion is given by the difference between the responses of paired direction-selective filters tuned to opposite directions of motion and if the responses of these paired filters saturate at modest contrasts.

17618494|t|Contact guidance enhances the quality of a tissue engineered corneal stroma.
17618494|a|Corneal stroma is a very complex structure, composed of 200 lamellae of oriented collagen fibers. This highly complex nature of cornea is known to be important for its transparency and mechanical integrity. Thus, an artificial cornea design has to take into account this complex structure. In this study, behavior of human corneal keratocytes on collagen films patterned with parallel channels was investigated. Keratocytes proliferated well on films and reached confluency after 7 days in the incubation medium. Nearly all of the cells responded to the patterns and were aligned in contrast to the cells on unpatterned surfaces. Collagen type I and keratan sulfate secreted by keratocytes on patterned films appeared to be aligned in the direction of the patterns. The films showed an intermediate degradation over the course of a month. On the whole, transparency of the films increased with degradation and decreased by the presence of the cells. The decrease was, however, low and transparency level was maintained on the patterned films while on the unpatterned films a sharp decrease in transparency was followed by an improvement. This was due to the more organized distribution of cells and the oriented secretion of extracellular matrix molecules on patterned collagen films. Thus, these results suggest that application of contact guidance in cornea tissue engineering may facilitate the remodeling process, hence decrease the rehabilitation period.

10395407|t|Effect of nedocromil sodium on non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neural responses in guinea pig bronchi in vitro.
10395407|a|OBJECTIVE: Nedocromil sodium (nedocromil) improves the clinical condition of asthmatic subjects but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. This study aimed to determine whether nedocromil alters the ability of contractile and relaxant non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neural (NANC) responses to stabilise tone by inhibiting or potentiating these responses in bronchial smooth muscle and, if so, whether the action is on a pre- or postjunctional level. RESULTS: Nedocromil attenuated contractile but not relaxant NANC responses (elicited by electric field stimulation) significantly (P < 0.05) in guinea pig main bronchi in vitro. However, the ability of NANC responses to stabilise tone (convergence effect) was not significantly impaired by nedocromil. Furthermore, nedocromil did not significantly shift the concentration response curve (-log EC50) to neurokinin A (NKA), the dominating contractile NANC transmitter, or alter the maximum response to NKA (P > 0.05). Submaximum or maximum contractile responses to histamine were not markedly affected by nedocromil (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nedocromil exerts selective neural inhibition of the contractile but not of the relaxant NANC responses on a pre-junctional level in bronchial smooth muscle. Nedocromil does not, however, markedly impair the ability of NANC response to stabilise bronchial smooth muscle tone.

1651462|t|Characterization and developmental evolution of a high-affinity binding site for calcitonin gene-related peptide on chick skeletal muscle membrane.
1651462|a|Calcitonin gene-related peptide is a putative neurotransmitter of central and peripheral nervous systems which coexists with acetylcholine in motor nerve terminals and exerts multiple effects on skeletal muscle, suggesting a trophic role for this neuropeptide. Using radiolabeled calcitonin gene-related peptide as a probe in a specific binding assay, we have characterized calcitonin gene-related peptide binding sites on chick skeletal muscle membranes. Binding is time-dependent, saturable and reversible. Scatchard analyses revealed two classes of sites: high-affinity sites with a KD value of 62 pM, and low-affinity sites with a KD value of 3.3 nM. The maximal number of sites is, respectively, 22 and 155 fmol/mg protein for high- and low-affinity binding sites. Specific binding was not affected by the presence, in excess, of other neuropeptides such as salmon calcitonin or somatostatin or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Affinity of the binding site for calcitonin gene-related peptide was decreased in the presence of 5'-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, suggesting a physiological coupling of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor to a GTP binding protein. In a developmental study of chick muscle, we found the highest activity of calcitonin gene-related peptide binding sites in 11-14 day embryos, following a pattern of evolution similar to that of acetylcholine receptors (constant ratio of 12 acetylcholine receptors per calcitonin gene-related peptide binding site). However, both receptors appear differentially regulated: while the number of acetylcholine receptors increases 5-16-fold after denervation, calcitonin gene-related peptide binding sites slightly diminish in number. These results are discussed in terms of the physiological significance of calcitonin gene-related peptide binding sites on chick skeletal muscle membrane.

2448909|t|Bronchospasm during cardiopulmonary bypass--a potentially fatal complication of open-heart surgery.
2448909|a|Severe bronchospasm at the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass is an unusual but dangerous complication of open-heart surgery. We report two cases. In both of them the final etiology remained unsettled. In one of the cases vigorous and immediate bronchodilatory therapy resulted in a favourable remission. In the second case bronchospasm contributed to a very harmful bulging of the left lung through the opened mediastinal pleura, stretching and damaging the left internal mammary artery graft, which obviously contributed to the fatal outcome. We emphasize especially the following points: 1) a carefully evaluated medical history of patients scheduled for open-heart surgery may reveal some details pointing to an increased risk of bronchospasm during cardiopulmonary bypass; in such cases prophylactic measures may be indicated; 2) immediate vigorous bronchodilatory therapy early at the onset of bronchospasm during the weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass may reverse the alarming situation.

1760076|t|Conception of man and the preservation of his health in circumpolar regions.
1760076|a|The preservation of human health in polar and circumpolar regions depends mainly on the strategy for future development of these regions. The consequences of human intervention into northern ecology are irreversible, as in the case of the greenhouse effect, the industrial and atomic pollution of polar nature, the tundra devastation, the destruction of northern flora and fauna etc. The ongoing creation of large industrial population centres in the North by means of newcomers is to be stopped. Polar regions are to be used for biospheric reservation and tourist sanitary zones, to preserve specific flora and fauna, to provide the rhythms and customs necessary to survive in extreme climatic and geophysical conditions of high latitudes. The program for securing man's survival in circumpolar regions should comprise several stages of practical measures to provide necessary resources and to combine international efforts. The preservation of man's health must be based on the understanding of the interrelation between health and biospheric processes and the assessment of the role of human intervention into polar ecology. A program facilitating the preservation of human health and survival in the North and in the Antarctic should be initiated.

2480631|t|Serum levels of CA 125 in patients with gastrointestinal cancers.
2480631|a|Serum levels of CA 125 and markers reputed as specific for cancers in relevant locations (squamous cell carcinoma, SCC, carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA, CA 19.9, alpha-fetoprotein, AFP) were determined in 107 patients with gastrointestinal (GI) carcinomas. The aim of this study was to assess their individual and combined sensitivities, and the power of CA 125 in excluding primary ovarian epithelial cancer from GI primary. Serum CA 125 levels (in U/ml) ranged from nondetectable to 400 in patients with esophageal, to 570 in those with gastric, and to 300 in patients with colorectal carcinoma. The levels for liver secondaries, pancreatic, and hepatocellular carcinoma were 480, 2,720 and 1,100 U/ml, respectively. Serum SCC antigen was elevated in all patients with esophageal cancer, CEA or CA 19.9 in 52% of patients with gastric cancer and in 63% with liver secondaries, and CEA in 95% of patients with colorectal cancer; whereas serum CA 125 above 65 U/ml was found in 25% of this subgroup, but only in those with already an elevated concentration of specific marker(s). Serum CEA or CA 19.9 was elevated in 71%, CA 125 in 59% of patients with pancreatic cancer; the latter mostly in those with already elevated CEA or CA 19.9. Serum AFP was elevated in 84% and CA 125 in 40% of patients with hepatoma; the latter mostly in those with already an elevated AFP. CA 125 values exceeding 1,000 U/ml were found in 1 patient with pancreatic cancer (2,720 U/ml) and in 2 with hepatoma (1,050 and 1,100 U/ml). These findings illustrate the nonspecificity of the CA 125 antigen, its small if any advantage compared to the specific markers, and they diminish its role as a marker for primary ovarian cancer from GI primary unless it exceeds 2,800 U/ml.

1705736|t|Effects of hypertonic saline (7.5%)/dextran 70 on human red cell typing, lysis, and metabolism in vitro.
1705736|a|The introduction of a 7.5% hypertonic saline/6% dextran 70 (HSD) solution into clinical trials for the treatment of hypovolemic states, and the past concerns regarding the possible interference of dextran with blood serology, prompted us to investigate the effects of HSD on human red-cell typing and stability. HSD was evaluated with fresh and 35-day stored CPDA-1 red cells from 12 healthy donors. A 1:5 mixture of HSD to blood in vitro had no effect on ABO, Rh, and MN typing in both fresh and stored blood. HSD produced no significant lysis with fresh cells and a minimal level with stored blood. No evidence of metabolic or morphologic changes was seen after HSD treatment. The results of this study suggest that the clinical use of HSD for the treatment of hemorrhagic shock will not affect blood group determinations or red-cell stability from stored blood which may be infused after the HSD-treated patient is transported to a hospital.

18601533|t|Activation of caspase-3 noninvolved in the bystander effect of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) system.
18601533|a|Use of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) system is one of the promising approaches in the rapidly growing area of gene therapy. The "bystander effect," a phenomenon in which HSV-tk+ cells exposed to GCV are toxic to adjacent HSV-tk- cells, was reported to play an important role in suicide gene therapy. However, the mechanism by which HSV-tk/GCV induces the bystander effect is poorly understood. We monitored the activation of caspase-3 in living cells induced by the HSV-tk/GCV system using a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe CD3, , a caspase-3 recognition site fused with a cyan fluorescent protien (CFP) and a red fluorescent protein (DsRed) which we reported and named in a previous paper. Fluorescence protein (FP)-based multicolor cellular labeling, combined with the multichannel fluorescence imaging and FRET imaging techniques, provides a novel and improved approach to directly determine whether the activation of caspase-3 involved in the HSV-tk/GCV system induces cell apoptosis in tk gene-expressing cells and their neighboring cells. FRET ratio images of CD3, and fluorescence images of the fusion protein of thymidine kinase linked with green fluorescent protein (TK-GFP), indicated that HSV-tk/GCV system-induced apoptosis in human adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC-M) cells was via a caspase-3 pathway, and the activation of caspase-3 was not involved in the bystander effect of HSV-tk/GCV system.

10712678|t|Interferon-gamma plays a critical role in intestinal immunity against Salmonella typhimurium infection.
10712678|a|Salmonella bacteria are a major cause of food-borne infectious diarrhoea and there is great interest in understanding the pathogenesis of Salmonella infection and in vaccine development. Potential vaccines include the aromatic mutants of S. typhimurium. Such non-lethal Aro mutants have also been useful for studying Salmonella infections in mouse models. Studies of systemic infection, using these Aro mutants, in both normal and cytokine gene knockout mice, indicate that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plays a key role in the resolution of Salmonella infection. The present studies have investigated the outcome of oral infection in mice with attenuated Salmonella because this infection route mimics natural infection in humans. In IFN-gamma gene knockout (IFN-gamma-/-) mice, intestinal immunity was impaired and oral challenge resulted in disseminated septicaemia 2 weeks later. No dissemination of infection was seen in wild-type mice. In wild-type mice, both CD4 and CD8 cell numbers increased in the gut following Salmonella challenge, together with increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). No such changes were seen in IFNgamma-/- mice. Following oral challenge, antilipopolysaccharide (LPS) and antiphosphoryl choline antibodies increased by more than 100-fold in both serum and faecal pellet extracts of IFNgamma-/- mice compared with wild-type mice. Our data show that IFN-gamma production is essential for resolution of enteric Salmonella infection and that antibody has little effect on this process.

7505032|t|Toxicity of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 60 (HCO-60) in experimental animals.
7505032|a|HCO-60, a polyoxyethylene castor oil derivative, is used as a solubilizer in the injectable formulations of lipophilic agents. This study was performed to examine the toxicity of HCO-60 in various experimental animals including dogs, monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs and rats. With 1.25 or 2.5 mg/kg of HCO-60 injected i.v. to dogs, blood pressure decreased, flush, swelling and itching appeared after injection, and with 10 mg/kg of HCO-60 there was additionally a decrease of spontaneous motility. In the two higher dose groups, these symptoms paralleled an increase of histamine levels. Since degranulation was observed after injection in the mast cells of the skin, but not in the liver of dogs, the histamine in the plasma was considered to be released from the mast cells of the skin. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine, a H1-receptor antagonist, suppressed the decrease of blood pressure induced by HCO-60. These findings show that the toxicity of HCO-60 is associated with histamine release from the mast cells. No symptoms occurred in monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs or rats with 50 or 100 mg/kg of i.v. of HCO-60, and there was no change in plasma histamine levels. This study demonstrated that the toxicity of HCO-60 is species specific to dogs among the animals tested.

16965587|t|Development of models and detection methods for different forms of cytomegalovirus for the evaluation of viral inactivation agents.
16965587|a|BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is transmitted by transfusion of infected blood products and can cause serious diseases in specific risk groups. CMV can be present in infected blood as cell-free virus (CFV), cell-associated actively replicating virus (CAV), and cell-associated latent virus (LV). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In vitro models for all three infectious forms of CMV and virus detection assays based on both tissue culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed. The utility of the CMV model systems and assays were tested by validation studies of a novel pathogen inactivation agent, PEN110, for red blood cells. RESULTS: Reproducible high titers of CFV and CAV were obtained by optimized tissue culture techniques for CMV-infected MRC-5 cells. An LV model was obtained with CMV-infected THP-1 cells and reactivation of virus replication by phorbol ester treatment. The model systems showed that PEN110 treatment is effective against all three forms of CMV as measured by tissue culture-based infectivity assays and a long-range PCR method specific for detection of damage to CMV viral DNA. CONCLUSION: This study describes model systems to the relevant forms of CMV in blood and detection assays that can be used to evaluate the efficacy of viral inactivation agents.

15567492|t|Rhabdovirus assembly and budding.
15567492|a|Rhabdoviruses are a diverse, widely-distributed group of enveloped viruses that assemble and bud from the plasma membrane of host cells. Recent advances in the identification of domains on both the envelope glycoprotein and the matrix protein of rhabdoviruses that contribute to virus assembly and release have allowed us to refine current models of rhabdovirus budding and to describe in better detail the interplay between both viral and cellular components involved in the budding process. In this review we discuss the steps involved in rhabdovirus assembly beginning with genome encapsidation and the association of nucleocapsid-matrix protein pre-assembly complexes with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, how condensation of these complexes may occur, how microdomains containing the envelope glycoprotein facilitate bud site formation, and how multiple forms of the matrix protein may participate in virion extrusion and release.

9036950|t|TGF-beta suppresses IFN-gamma induction of class II MHC gene expression by inhibiting class II transactivator messenger RNA expression.
9036950|a|Recently, a non-DNA binding protein, class II transactivator (CIITA), has been shown to be required for constitutive and IFN-gamma-inducible class II MHC transcription. The cytokine TGF-beta inhibits IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC expression at the transcriptional level. In this study, we provide evidence that TGF-beta blocks IFN-gamma-induced CIITA mRNA accumulation. TGF-beta down-regulates class II MHC and CIITA mRNA accumulation in human astroglioma and fibrosarcoma cell lines, but TGF-beta does not destabilize the CIITA message, suggesting an effect at the transcriptional level. In cells that stably overexpressed CIITA, leading to a constitutive class II MHC-positive phenotype, the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta on class II MHC was abrogated, but the cells remained responsive for expression of TGF-beta-inducible genes. Cell lines that possessed defects in TGF-beta signaling also became refractory to inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced CIITA and class II MHC expression. Our data indicate that TGF-beta suppresses IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC expression by inhibiting accumulation of CIITA mRNA.

8946295|t|Factors associated with visual acuity loss after noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation.
8946295|a|PURPOSE: To determine the factors associated with visual acuity loss following transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation (TYC). METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied 479 patients followed for a mean of 22 months after the initial TYC in one eye and analyzed the data with univariate and multivariate analysis for the factors associated with visual acuity loss. Data analyzed included age, race, sex, preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual acuity, type of glaucoma, total energy per treatment, number of retreatments, final IOP, and duration of follow-up. RESULTS: The preoperative factors associated with visual acuity loss after TYC as determined by both univariate and multivariate analysis were neovascular glaucoma (p = 0.001, odds ratio = 2.80) and black race (p = 0.044, odds ratio = 1.67). Postoperative hypotony and follow-up of > 6 months were also associated with visual acuity loss (p < 0.001, odds ratio = 6.68 and p = 0.046, odds ratio = 2.61, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation is associated with a greater risk of visual acuity loss in patients with neovascular glaucoma and in the black population. Postoperative hypotony is associated with a poor visual outcome, whereas the association with longer follow-up duration suggests that other factors, related to the patient's underlying disease, are also significant factors.

In this study, we conducted to evaluate the effects of Radix Ginseng (RG) and Radix Trichosanthis (RT) on the melanogenesis in the B16 melanoma cells. The cells were treated for 48 h with RT at concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 microg/ml, RG at concentration of 10-1000 microg/ml, or RG at various doses (10-1000 microg/ml) with 25 microg/ml RT. Treatment with RT alone dose-dependently suppressed tyrosinase activity and melanin content compared with untreated control, and significantly inhibited cell proliferation. However, RG at various concentrations did not exhibit any significant change of them. Treatment with RT in the presence of various concentrations of RG suppressed tyrosinase activity and melanin content, similar to treatment with RT alone, but slightly increased cell proliferation. Furthermore, tyrosinase protein level was significantly decreased in treatment with 25 microg/ml RT alone and with a combination of 100 microg/ml RG. These results indicate that treatment with RG and RT significantly inhibits the melanogenesis in B16 cells, and raise the possibility that this combination may be effective in the whitening agent for the skin.

2024781|t|Deep-etching immunogold replica electron microscopy of cytoskeletal elements in cultured hamster heart cells.
2024781|a|A procedure has been developed for the three-dimensional immunoelectron microscopic localization of cytoskeletal filaments by a deep-etching replica method in combination with immunogold labeling and/or myosin subfragment 1 (S1) decoration techniques. Neonatal hamster heart cells grown on glass coverslips were extracted with Triton X-100 or physically permeabilized by breaking open the cell membranes. S1 decoration was performed on some specimens immediately after the permeabilization. After prefixation in formaldehyde, samples were immunostained with poly- or monoclonal antibodies to desmin or vimentin, and indirectly tagged with colloidal gold probes by the biotin-streptavidin method. After postfixation with glutaraldehyde, tannic acid and osmium tetroxide, the cells were freeze-etched and rotary-replicated with platinum and carbon in a freeze-fracture apparatus. Replicas were viewed with a transmission electron microscope using a tilting specimen stage to obtain stereo images. The procedure made it possible to identify the specific filaments within the complex cytoskeletal networks in cultured hamster heart muscle and nonmuscle cells at high resolution and in three dimensions. The method has advantages in its three-dimensionality and feasibility to evaluate the data by comparing them with those obtained by alternative light microscopic methods. Details of the protocol and a description of the results of using three different antibodies are given.

2940864|a|Hearing impairment and otologic problems have been reported to be prevalent among individuals with Down syndrome. This study was designed to determine whether children with Down syndrome have a higher prevalence of auditory abnormalities than do children with other forms of mental retardation. Hearing, impedance, and otoscopic examinations were performed on 30 children with Down syndrome and 30 children without Down syndrome matched for CA and IQ. Results indicated that the children with Down syndrome had a significantly higher prevalence of hearing impairment and otologic disorders.

15638711|t|Antibody engineering, virus retargeting and cellular immunotherapy: one ring to rule them all?
15638711|a|Solid tumours present numerous obstacles for efficient systemic delivery of therapeutic agents. This goal has to face specific problems related to the nature of each targeting element, but also the physical barriers posed by tumours, such as heterogeneous blood supply and elevated interstitial pressure. These barriers impair the delivery to tumours of antibodies or viral particles. Immune cells are supposed to be endowed with the ability to target tumours, but in general, tumour cells themselves provide poor targets for immunological responses. A key challenge of tumour gene therapy (cell carrier- and/or viral vector-mediated) is to control the site at which genes are expressed by instructing cells or virus or to distinguish between target and non-target tissue. Thus, antibody-directed targeting of virus or cells could potentially improve both the safety and the efficacy of therapeutic gene delivery to tumours. Furthermore, virus production can rely on carrier cells under the transcriptional control of a factor activated after specific triggering of a tumour-specific receptor. Given that any of these anti-tumour strategies by themselves have fulfilled their therapeutic potential, we propose here their combination for developing more effective anti-cancer therapies.

8471144|t|Plasma tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in patients with burns.
8471144|a|Levels of plasma tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined consecutively in 42 patients with burns > 20 per cent of the total body surface area using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the early period after injury (including the period of burn shock), 24 patients had detectable TNF-alpha levels in their plasma. However, the plasma TNF-alpha levels at the time of admission were very low and did not correlate with the extent of the burn or the prognosis. In contrast, the maximum plasma TNF-alpha level over the whole clinical course was significantly correlated with the area of the burn and the prognosis. No correlation was found between the plasma TNF-alpha and plasma endotoxin levels. TNF-alpha may be produced locally in infected burns and monitoring of plasma TNF-alpha levels may be a useful prognostic indicator for burns patients.

18689735|t|Passive treatment of acid mine drainage with high metal concentrations using dispersed alkaline substrate.
18689735|a|Passive treatment systems based on the dissolution of coarse calcite grains are widely used to remediate acid mine drainage (AMD). Unfortunately, they tolerate only low metal concentrations or acidity loads, because they are prone to passivation (loss of reactivity due to coating) and/or clogging (loss of permeability) by precipitates. To overcome these problems, a dispersed alkaline substrate (DAS) composed of a fine-grained alkaline reagent (calcite sand) mixed with a coarse inert matrix (wood chips) was developed. The small grains provide a large reactive surface and dissolve almost completely before the growing layer of precipitates passivates the substrate, whereas the dispersion of nuclei for precipitation on the inert surfaces retards clogging. Chemical and hydraulic performance of DAS was investigated in two laboratory columns fed at different flow rates with natural AMD of pH 2.3 to 3.5 and inflow net acidity 1350 to 2300 mg/L as CaCO(3). The DAS columns removed 900 to 1600 mg/L net acidity, 3 to 4.5 times more than conventional passive treatment systems. Regardless of the flow rate employed, Al, Fe(III), Cu, and Pb were virtually eliminated. Minor Zn, Ni, and Cd were removed at low flow rates. High acidity removal is possible because these metals accumulate intentionally in DAS, and their precipitation promotes further calcite dissolution. During 15 mo, DAS operated without clogging at 120 g acidity/m(2).d, four times the loading rate recommended for conventional passive systems; DAS may therefore be capable of treating AMD at sites where influent chemistry precludes the use of other passive systems.

1342752|t|Urban planning in metropolitan areas of Asia: the challenge of accomodating the informal sector.
1342752|a|One paradox in the recent pattern of urbanization in Asia is 'metropolisation' and 'informalization'. This is paradoxical since growth and development of a metropolis is expected to reduce its traditional or informal sector. From available evidence, this paper shows that metropolisation in Asia, instead of reducing the size of informal sector, is rather providing new impetus to its growth. After revealing the nature and content of these growth patterns, the paper argues the case for making changes in the urban planning paradigms for accommodation of the informal sector in metropolitan development. The concurrent expansion of a metropolis and the informal sector within it will not appear paradoxical, the author believes, once the traditional urban planning paradigms of land use, zoning, and standards, mostly evolved from the Western experience of urban-industrial development, are modified in light of the socio-economic realities of the Asian metropolises. The huge population base of the respective countries relative to capital and other material resources, and vast qualitative change in the production structure of urban metropolitan economies have made the presence of the informal sector rather functionally relevant in the very heart of their metropolises. The paper provides some directions, citing examples from several cities, as to how to make the necessary accommodation. The paper further contends that mere physical accommodation by legal acceptance and provisions will not be enough. The other major direction of change in urban planning ought to be for integrating the physical, economic, and social dimensions of planning for ensuring better quality of life for all instead of a small proportion of people.

17522713|a|Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) can be considered as a paradigm for neoplasias that evolve through a multi-step process. CML is also one of the best examples of a disease that can be targeted by molecular therapy; however, the success of new 'designer drugs' is largely restricted to the chronic phase of the disease. If not cured at this stage, CML invariably progresses and transforms into an acute-type leukaemia undergoing a 'blast crisis'. The causes of this transformation are still poorly understood. What mechanisms underlie this progression, and are they shared by other common cancers?

2726114|t|Early prediction of antepartum hypertension.
2726114|a|We validated a mid-pregnancy screening mean arterial pressure (MAP2) of 85 mmHg or higher as a significant predictor of hypertension in pregnancy. During the 17-month period from October 1984 through February 1986, 730 women, or 16% of all women cared for and delivered at our institution, were screened at or near 20 weeks of amenorrhea. Of the 139 women with a MAP2 of 85 mmHg or higher, 21.6% developed antepartum hypertension, compared with only 0.7% of the 591 women with a MAP2 below 85 mmHg. The screening MAP2 level of 85 mmHg was the optimal cutoff for MAP2 as a screening test. Controlling for the value of the screening MAP2, the only other important predictors of antepartum hypertension were chronic hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Using these three variables, the probability that an individual pregnant woman will develop antepartum hypertension can be assessed with a high degree of accuracy (84.5%) by 20 weeks of amenorrhea. This assessment is noninvasive and simple to use. Three distinct levels of risk have been defined; the moderate- and high-risk groups warrant careful surveillance during pregnancy and may be reasonable groups in which to test preventive interventions.

10230805|t|Hepatocyte-specific distribution of catalase and its inhibitory effect on hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice.
10230805|a|To explore the possibility of using catalase for the treatment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated injuries, the pharmacokinetics of bovine liver catalase (CAT) labeled with 111In was investigated in mice. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, more than 70% of 111In-CAT was recovered in the liver within 10 min after intravenous injection. In addition, 111In-CAT was predominantly recovered from the parenchymal cells (PC) in the liver. Increasing the dose retarded the hepatic uptake of 111In-CAT, suggesting saturation of the uptake process. This cell-specific uptake could not be inhibited by coadministration of various compounds which are known to be taken up by liver PC, indicating that the uptake mechanism of CAT by PC is very specific to this compound. The preventive effect of CAT on a hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury was examined in mice by measuring the GOT and GPT levels in plasma. A bolus injection of CAT at 5 min prior to the reperfusion attenuated the increase in the levels of these indicators in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that catalase can be used for various hepatic injuries caused by ROS.

11889118|t|Cooperative action of Escherichia coli ClpB protein and DnaK chaperone in the activation of a replication initiation protein.
11889118|a|The Escherichia coli molecular chaperone protein ClpB is a member of the highly conserved Hsp100/Clp protein family. Previous studies have shown that the ClpB protein is needed for bacterial thermotolerance. Purified ClpB protein has been shown to reactivate chemically and heat-denatured proteins. In this work we demonstrate that the combined action of ClpB and the DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperones leads to the activation of DNA replication of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2. In contrast, ClpB is not needed for the activation of the oriC-dependent replication of E. coli. Using purified protein components we show that the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE synergistic action activates the plasmid RK2 replication initiation protein TrfA by converting inactive dimers to an active monomer form. In contrast, Hsp78/Ssc1/Mdj1/Mge1, the corresponding protein system from yeast mitochondria, cannot activate the TrfA replication protein. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system is involved in protein monomerization and in the activation of a DNA replication factor.

36070|a|UMPK 3 is a rare variant of the polymorphic enzyme of human red cells, uridine monophosphate kinase. This homozygote phenotype was detected among the Warao Indians of Venezuela. The UMPK 1 and UMPK 3 enzymes were partially purified following the method described by Tend et al. (1976). The biochemical and kinetic parameters of both variants were studied in crude hemolysates and in partially purified enzymes. A comparison was made with the results previously reported by Teng for UMPK 1 and UMPK 2, and it was concluded that UMPK 3 seems to resemble the other two allelic gene products in Km values for UMP, CMP, and ATP but differs from them in electrophoretic mobility, pH optimum, and thermal stability.

5006276|t|A new hearing test applicable to the crying newborn infant.
5006276|a|Hearing tests in newborn infants hitherto described have been designed to elicit a response to a sound when the infants are quiet or asleep. It has been accepted that there was no response when they were crying. The present observation describes the effect of a sound stimulus on the crying newborn infant. I have observed that if the infant is not extremely distressed it is possible to get a response regularly. What I did was to make a continuous sound at a distance of 15 to 30 cms. and the babies regularly stopped their cry sequence. The vocal intensity required was less than that of the baby's cry. This quieting response suggests auditory attention or a reflex mediated at a cortical level. The response to this vocal sound is analysed in terms of its effect on heart rate and respiration. It is compared with the effect of a pure tone stimulus of different pitch. It seems to be elicited with notes of low pitch and occurs independent of age or birth weight. The implications and possible long-term significance of the response will be discusses.

1717361|a|A case of an extremely rare cystic lesion of the pancreas is presented. The multilocular cyst was found adjacent to the upper border of the pancreatic body, and the cyst contained bean curd lees-like substances. Histologically, the cyst wall consisted of mature keratinizing squamous epithelium and surrounding lymphoid tissue stroma, and the cyst was filled with keratinized materials. A histopathologic diagnosis of typical lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas, proposed by Truong et al (Am J Surg Pathol 11:899-903, 1987), was made. Its histogenesis is still unknown; however, we hypothesize that it might arise from a benign epithelial inclusion of a peripancreatic lymph node, followed by squamous metaplasia of the epithelial inclusion. We recently found a retropyloric lymph node with a squamous epithelial inclusion, which might support this hypothesis regarding the histogenesis of the cyst.

8474946|t|Promoting preventive care with patient-held minirecords: a review.
8474946|a|Although patient involvement is essential for the success of all types of preventive care, patient involvement in clinical prevention has been limited. Patient-held minirecords have recently received support from public health authorities, providers and the public as a means to improve patient involvement in preventive care for adults. This paper reviews the history and current developments in patient-held minirecord use for preventive care. Methods: A literature review was performed using sources obtained from electronically searching the Medline database from 1966 to the present and using reference lists to obtain secondary sources. The author's collection of privately and governmentally produced minirecords was also utilized. Findings: Patient-held minirecords have been widely and successfully employed to improve preventive care for children, particularly with regard to immunizations. They have not been widely used to promote adult preventive care. Several clinical trials have found that their use can lead to improved preventive care for the general adult population. Potential advantages of patient-held minirecords include: improved performance rates of preventive care, improved continuity of preventive care, low cost and improved practice promotion for prevention-oriented providers. Potential barriers to the use of patient-held minirecords include: the traditional power relationship of physicians and patients, physicians' reticence to share records with patients and time and effort costs. The optimal characteristics of a patient-held minirecord for adult preventive care remain to be delineated by research and evaluation. Significance: A patient-held minirecord is an inexpensive, practical intervention that can help build patient involvement and improve the quality of preventive care for adults as well as children.

18483265|t|A small molecule disruptor of Rb/Raf-1 interaction inhibits cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and growth of human tumor xenografts in nude mice.
18483265|a|Although it is well established that cyclin-dependent kinases phosphorylate and inactivate Rb, the Raf-1 kinase physically interacts with Rb and initiates the phosphorylation cascade early in the cell cycle. We have identified an orally active small molecule, Rb/Raf-1 disruptor 251 (RRD-251), that potently and selectively disrupts the Rb/Raf-1 but not Rb/E2F, Rb/prohibitin, Rb/cyclin E, and Rb/HDAC binding. The selective inhibition of Rb/Raf-1 binding suppressed the ability of Rb to recruit Raf-1 to proliferative promoters and inhibited E2F1-dependent transcriptional activity. RRD-251 inhibited anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of human cancer cells and knockdown of Rb with short hairpin RNA or forced expression of E2F1 rescued cells from RRD-251-mediated growth arrest. P.o. treatment of mice resulted in significant tumor growth suppression only in tumors with functional Rb, and this was accompanied by inhibition of angiogenesis, inhibition of proliferation, decreased phosphorylated Rb levels, and inhibition of Rb/Raf-1 but not Rb/E2F1 binding in vivo. Thus, selective targeting of Rb/Raf-1 interaction seems to be a promising approach for developing novel chemotherapeutic agents.

14708639|t|Effects of long-term administration of Senna occidentalis seeds in the large bowel of rats.
14708639|a|Plants of the genus Senna that contain anthranoides derivatives are frequently used as cathartics. Radiological studies have demonstrated that patients with chronic constipation who have used stimulant laxative have colonic redundancy and dilatation more frequently than patients who have not. The objective of the present work was to study morphological and histochemical changes of the lower gut after administration of Senna occidentalis seeds for a long period to rats, as observed in skeletal muscle fibers. Fragments of the lower gut of young and adult rats treated with S. occidentalis seeds (2% for 171 days and 3% for 61 days in the diet) were submitted to histological and histochemical analysis and to densitometry. The most important finding was decreased oxidative enzyme activity in smooth muscle cells and in myenteric neurons of the large bowel. As oxidative metabolism is essential for ATP and energy production, these results suggest that the functional intestinal disturbance caused by the chronic use of Senna occidentalis as a laxative can be due to a metabolic effect involving energy production, which would decrease colonic motility and cause functional colonic dilatation, but without any irreversible anatomic change.

15754176|t|Mirror, mirror on the wall: viewing a mirror reflection of unilateral hand movements facilitates ipsilateral M1 excitability.
15754176|a|Primary motor cortex (M1) excitability is modulated by both ipsilateral limb movement and passive observation of movement of the contralateral limb. An interaction of these effects within M1 may account for recent research suggesting improved functional recovery of the impaired arm following stroke by viewing a mirror reflection of movements of the unimpaired arm superimposed over the (unseen) impaired arm. This hypothesis was tested in the present study using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in eight neurologically healthy subjects. Excitability of M1 ipsilateral to a phasic, unilateral hand movement was measured while subjects performed paced (1 Hz), unilateral index finger-thumb opposition movements. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained from the inactive first dorsal interosseous (FDI) in each of four viewing conditions: Active (viewing the active hand), Central (viewing a mark positioned between hands), Inactive (viewing the inactive hand) and Mirror (viewing a mirror-reflection of the active hand in a mirror oriented in the mid-sagittal plane) and with both hands at rest (Rest). MEPs were significantly enhanced during ipsilateral hand movement compared with the Rest condition (P<0.05). Largest MEPs were obtained in the Mirror condition, and this was significant compared with both the Inactive and Central viewing conditions (P<0.05). There was no difference between the dominant and non-dominant hand. Excitability of M1 ipsilateral to a unilateral hand movement is facilitated by viewing a mirror reflection of the moving hand. This finding provides neurophysiological evidence supporting the application of mirror therapy in stroke rehabilitation.

10515826|t|Correlation of behaviors with microbiological changes in vaginal flora.
10515826|a|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by dramatic changes in the vaginal ecosystem. Women without evidence of vaginal infection may exhibit transient changes in their flora. We prospectively followed up women by using diaries and self-obtained vaginal smears to correlate behaviors with changes in flora. The majority of women (38/51, 78%) had significant, although transient, changes. Behaviors associated with unstable flora were a history of BV, a greater number of partners, and more frequent episodes of receptive oral sex. Only the latter remained significantly associated in the multivariate analysis. Variables that were associated with day-to-day variability in the flora included use of vaginal medication, menses, greater number of partners, spermicide use, more frequent vaginal intercourse, and less frequent use of condoms. Only a minority of women (11/51, 22%) maintained a "normal" lactobacillus-predominant flora. Factors associated with instability of the flora are similar to those epidemiologically associated with BV.

7958543|t|Monitoring kidney function in diabetic nephropathy.
7958543|a|Progression in diabetic nephropathy is usually determined by repeated measurements of glomerular filtration rate and expressed as rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate. Our aim was to evaluate the agreement between rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate estimated from the Cockroft-Gault formula: (140-age)*K*body weight*(1/S-creatinine) and measured by the plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA. All insulin-dependent diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy followed-up for at least 5 years with at least 5 simultaneous measurements of glomerular filtration rate, s-creatinine, and weight were included in the study. Forty-three patients (32 male/11 female), age 31 (18-61) years were enrolled. Observation period: 6.6 (5.1-9.9) years and number of investigations per patient 6 (5-16) (median(range)). Baseline glomerular filtration rate (ml/min) was 97 (30) measured and 107 (37) estimated (mean(SD))(p < 0.001) and the 95% limits of agreement were -42.0 to 20.8 ml/min. Measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate correlated significantly (r = 0.91, p < 0.00001). Rate of decline in kidney function ml.min-1.year-1 was 4.7 (3.3) measured and 4.8 (3.5) estimated (mean(SD)) (NS), but the 95% limits of agreement showed a wide range -3.9 to 3.5 ml.min-1.year-1. A significant correlation between rate of decline in measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate was present (r = 0.84, p < 0.00001). In conclusion, glomerular filtration rate is overestimated by the Cockroft-Gault formula. The mean rates of decline in glomerular filtration rate are comparable, but the limits of agreement are wide, which make the Cockroft-Gault method unacceptable for clinical purposes, i.e. monitoring progression in kidney function in the individual patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

7446629|t|Ultrasound-facilitated intrauterine transfusions.
7446629|a|Ultrasound-facilitated intrauterine transfusion was performed on 35 fetuses. Eleven fetuses were hydropic and less than 26 weeks' gestation at the time of the first intrauterine transfusion (IUT). Only two (18%) neonates survived. Twelve fetuses were not hydropic and less than 26 weeks' gestation at time of IUT. Six (50%) neonates survived. Corrected neonatal survival rates for three hydropic and nine nonhydropic fetuses transfused after 26 weeks were 100% and 78%, respectively. The presence of ascites documented by ultrasound is an adequate indication for an IUT and permitted earlier detection of sicker fetuses; however, as a therapeutic aid, ultrasound neither diminished the fetal morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure nor completely eliminated the need for radiography to confirm proper intra-abdominal localization of the transfusion tubing.

8069987|t|Anatomy of the posterior approach to the lumbar plexus block.
8069987|a|The purpose of this study was to describe the relation of the lumbar plexus with the psoas major and with the superficial and deep landmarks close to it. Four cadavers were dissected and 22 computed tomography files of the lumbosacral region studied. Cadaver dissections demonstrated that the lumbar plexus, at the level of L5, is within the substance of the psoas major muscle rather than between this muscle and the quadratus lumborum. The femoral nerve lies between the lateral femoral cutaneous and obturator nerves. However, while the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is in the same fascial plane as the femoral nerve, the obturator nerve can be found in the same plane as the two other nerves or in its own muscular fold. Radiological data provided the following measurements: the femoral nerve is at a depth of 9.01 +/- 2.43 cm; the psoas major medial border is at 2.73 +/- 0.64 cm from the median sagittal plane; and its lateral border is at 6.41 +/- 1.61 cm from the same plane. It is concluded that the lumbar plexus is within the psoas major, that the obturator nerve localization within the psoas major varies and that computed tomography data define precisely the relationship of the lumbar plexus with superficial and deep landmarks.

2529631|t|[Does the cardiogoniogram change following revascularization?]
2529631|a|19 patients with one-vessel coronary disease were studied by cardiogoniometry (CGM), a new computerized vectorcardiographic method, before and after revascularization. In 14 patients revascularization had been performed by the method of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) and in 5 patients by aortocoronary bypass operation. Although the majority of cases showed a good postoperative result, CGM parameters failed to demonstrate a significant change, i.e. a previous pathologic CGM remained unchanged. It therefore appears to be doubtful whether CGM is reliable enough to assess the results of revascularization, possibly because it is more sensitive to infarcted than potentially ischemic yet vital myocardium.

6789433|t|Gas tension profile of the lung of the viper, Vipera xanthina palestinae.
6789433|a|Oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations along the lung of five awake, resting Palestine vipers were continuously measured by mass spectrometry. Ventilatory volumes, body wall movements and heart rate were also measured. In the anterior part of the faveolar (respiratory) lung, oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations returned to within 1% of inspired composition with each inspiration. Between breaths, changes of 0.5-2% in gas concentrations were seen in the faveolar region but practically no changes occurred in the caudal, non-respiratory lung (air sac) where mean oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations of 16.4% and 2.5% respectively were recorded. The respiratory exchange ratio dropped from near 1.5 in the anterior faveolar region to zero in the transition zone to the air sac. Instantaneous R values declined with breath-holding time in each location along the length of the lung. Gas exchange appears greatest in the posterior faveolar region near the heart and there is evidence of cardiogenic gas mixing in this region. The posterior air sac may either passively respond to air movements in the anterior lung or it may participate in ventilation. During periods of extended breath-holding (10-15 min) pronounced body wall movements were seen but there was no air flow from the mouth and gas exchange continued in the lung with rapidly decreasing R.

11292380|a|In eukaryotic cells, the membranes of different intracellular organelles have different lipid composition, and various biomembranes show an asymmetric distribution of lipid types across the membrane bilayer. Membrane lipid organization reflects a dynamic equilibrium of lipids moving across the bilayer in both directions. In this review, we summarize data supporting the role of specific membrane proteins in catalyzing transbilayer lipid movement, thereby controlling and regulating the distribution of lipids over the leaflets of biomembranes.

4026003|t|Isolation of mononuclear cells from bovine milk by continuous-flow and density gradient centrifugation: response of cells to mitogens.
4026003|a|Continuous-flow centrifugation (CFC) and 2 types of discontinuous density gradients (Ficoll-diatrizoate or polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated colloidal silica) were used to obtain bovine mononuclear cells from milk. Determinants considered were efficiency of cell recovery, cell viability, and functional activity of the enriched cell population in a lymphocyte blastogenesis (LBT) assay. Milk leukocytes were recovered by CFC with an efficiency of 46% and a viability of 63%. Selective loss of a cell population due to CFC was not observed. Using density gradients, enrichment was marginally effective (73% mononuclear cells with polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated colloidal silica and 82% mononuclear cells with Ficoll-diatrizoate) and overall mononuclear cell efficiency of recovery was reduced. In comparison, using either density gradient, blood mononuclear cells were harvested with efficiencies of 61.5% and 63.4%, with 85.6% and 89.3% viability and greater than 99% purity. Compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes, milk mononuclear cells were less viable. When evaluated using the LBT assay, milk mononuclear cells were hyporesponsive to mitogenic stimulation, regardless of the density gradient used. The methods used allowed for the collection of a sufficient number of nonelicited milk mononuclear cells for replicate evaluation of several mitogens or antigens, using the LBT assay. Mononuclear cells recovered had a consistently reproducible blastogenic response to T-cell mitogens.

16098508|t|Microarray analysis of gene expression in the liver during the urinary ethanol cycle in rats fed ethanol intragastrically at a constant rate.
16098508|a|The regulation of gene expression in the liver of ethanol fed rats was studied using microarray analysis. The changes in gene expression were compared between pair-fed controls and rats fed ethanol intragastrically at a constant rate for 1 month. The rats fed ethanol were sacrificed at low and high urinary ethanol levels (UAL) during the UAL cycle in order to compare the effects of high and low blood alcohol levels (BAL). The results of the microarray analysis indicated that the pattern of gene expression was very different when the controls, high UAL, and low UAL livers were compared. Many of the gene expression changes reflected nonparenchymal cell alterations such as neuroendocrine or muscle related gene expression. When the results of protein levels and gene expression were compared for individual genes, correlations were variable indicating that post-translational factors modified the effects of the changes in gene expression. This was further emphasized by the fact that activation of proteins by phosphorylation as the result of signaling kinase cascades, was not reflected in the microarray analysis results. For instance, the importance of blood alcohol levels at the time that the assays were performed, profoundly changed the gene expression, protein level, and protein phosphorylation level profiles.

17706498|t|Effect of probiotics on intestinal regrowth and bacterial translocation after massive small bowel resection in a rat.
17706498|a|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Because of their ability to inhibit intestinal bacterial overgrowth, probiotics (PROs) have been advocated for the treatment of patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS). This study was conducted to determine the effect of PROs on bacterial translocation and intestinal regrowth after massive small bowel resection in a rat. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 experimental groups: sham rats underwent bowel transection and reanastomosis, SBS rats underwent 75% small bowel resection, and SBS-PRO rats underwent bowel resection and were treated with a PRO given in drinking water from day 4 through 14. Intestinal structural changes (bowel circumference, overall bowel and mucosal weight, mucosal DNA and protein, villus height and crypt depth, enterocyte proliferation and enterocyte apoptosis) and bacterial translocation (BT) to mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, portal blood, and peripheral blood were determined on day 15 after operation. RESULTS: Sham rats exhibited a 20% BT to the mesenteric lymph nodes (level I), liver (level II), and blood (level III). Short bowel syndrome rats demonstrated a 100% BT to lymph nodes (level I) and liver (level II) and 40% translocation to peripheral blood (level III). Treatment with PROs resulted in a significant decrease in BT to all 3 target organs and decreased enterocyte apoptosis compared with SBS-untreated animals. Short bowel syndrome rats showed a significant increase (vs sham) in jejunal and ileal bowel and mucosal weight, mucosal DNA and protein, villus height, and crypt depth. Short bowel syndrome rats also had a greater proliferation index and apoptotic index in both jejunum and ileum compared with sham animals. SBS-PRO rats showed a significant increase (vs SBS rats) in crypt depth in ileum and a mild decrease in apoptotic index in jejunum and ileum, compared with SBS-untreated animals. CONCLUSIONS: In a rat model of SBS, PROs decrease BT through mechanisms which maybe dependent on intestinal mucosal integrity.

10647946|t|Take up the caregiver's burden: stories of care for urban African American elders with dementia.
10647946|a|This pilot study uses an anthropological gaze to analyze transcripts of extended in-home interviews among a set of ten caregivers of African-American elders with dementia. How are race and ethnicity made to matter in the recognition of, the meaning-making around and the responses to dementing illness among a sample of African-American caregivers? The essay contrasts prevailing cultural representations of African-American caregiver burden with caregiver interview data. What we find is that current constructs which consistently demonstrate "lesser burden" among African-American caregivers compared with Whites may not adequately capture these caregivers' experiences. Interpretations of experiences, meanings of "burden" and the logic of symptoms in the illness narratives generated by these African-American caregivers of elders with dementia require attention to the embodiment of large scale sociopolitical and historical forces like residential, educational and occupational segregation, institutional racism, and economic exploitation over the life course.

17298064|t|The reactivity with CO of AHb1 and AHb2 from Arabidopsis thaliana is controlled by the distal HisE7 and internal hydrophobic cavities.
17298064|a|The nonsymbiotic hemoglobins, AHb1 and AHb2, have recently been isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana. Using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic methods, we show that Fe2+ AHb1 contains a mixture of penta- and hexacoordinated heme, while Fe2+ AHb2 is fully hexacoordinated. In the CO complexes, polar interactions and H-bonds with the ligand are stronger for AHb1 than for AHb2. The ligand binding kinetics are substantially different, reflecting the distribution between the penta- and hexacoordinated species, and indicate that protein dynamics and ligand migration pathways are very specific for each of the two proteins. In particular, a very small, non-exponential geminate rebinding observed in AHb1 suggests that the distal heme cavity is connected with the exterior by a relatively open channel. The large, temperature-dependent geminate rebinding observed for AHb2 implies a major role of protein dynamics in the ligand migration from the distal cavity to the solvent. The structures of AHb1 and AHb2, modeled on the basis of the homologous rice hemoglobin, exhibit a different cavity system that is fully compatible with the observed ligand binding kinetics. Overall, these kinetic and structural data are consistent with the putative NO-dioxygenase activity previously attributed to AHb1, whereas the role of AHb2 remains elusive.

15022635|t|The operons, a criterion to compare the reliability of transcriptome analysis tools: ICA is more reliable than ANOVA, PLS and PCA.
15022635|a|The number of statistical tools used to analyze transcriptome data is continuously increasing and no one, definitive method has so far emerged. There is a need for comparison and a number of different approaches has been taken to evaluate the effectiveness of the different statistical tools available for microarray analyses. In this paper, we describe a simple and efficient protocol to compare the reliability of different statistical tools available for microarray analyses. It exploits the fact that genes within an operon exhibit the same expression patterns. In order to compare the tools, the genes are ranked according to the most relevant criterion for each tool; for each tool we look at the number of different operons represented within the first twenty genes detected. We then look at the size of the interval within which we find the most significant genes belonging to each operon in question. This allows us to define and estimate the sensitivity and accuracy of each statistical tool. We have compared four statistical tools using Bacillus subtilis expression data: the analysis of variance (ANOVA), the principal component analysis (PCA), the independent component analysis (ICA) and the partial least square regression (PLS). Our results show ICA to be the most sensitive and accurate of the tools tested. In this article, we have used the protocol to compare statistical tools applied to the analysis of differential gene expression. However, it can also be applied without modification to compare the statistical tools developed for other types of transcriptome analyses, like the study of gene co-expression.

15325653|t|The use of recombinant methods and molecular engineering in protein crystallization.
15325653|a|Recombinant techniques are routinely used for the preparation of protein samples for structural studies including X-ray crystallography. Among other benefits, these methods allow for a vast increase in the amount of obtained protein as compared to purification from source tissues, ease of purification when fusion proteins containing affinity tags are used, introduction of SeMet for phasing, and the opportunity to modify the protein to enhance its crystallizability. Protein engineering may involve removal of flexible regions including termini and interior loops, as well as replacement of residues that affect solubility. Moreover, modification of the protein surface to induce crystal growth may include rational engineering of surface patches that can readily mediate crystal contacts. The latter approach can be used to obtain proteins of crystals recalcitrant to crystallization or to obtain well-diffracting crystals in lieu of wild-type crystals yielding data to limited resolution. This review discusses recent advances in the field and describes a number of examples of diverse protein engineering techniques used in crystallographic investigations.

2856073|t|Erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase inhibition by acute lead exposure in neonatal rats.
2856073|a|Inhibition by lead of erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5N) is thought to contribute to morphological abnormalities observed in red blood cells (RBC) of lead-exposed subjects. However, neither the mechanism of lead inhibition of P5N nor the relationship of this inhibition to blood lead levels attained in exposed subjects is known. In the present investigation, acute in vivo and in vitro lead acetate effects on erythrocyte P5N from 21-day-old rat pups were determined and were related to blood lead concentrations ascertained by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Acute lead administration to rat pups resulted in a 16% to 21% reduction in erythrocyte P5N, with mean blood lead levels ranging from 77 to 108 micrograms/dl 24 hours later. Inhibition of erythrocyte P5N was linearly related to blood lead level (r = -0.67, P less than 0.05) following acute lead administration. Lead acetate addition to RBC preparations from 21-day-old rats resulted in concentration-dependent P5N inhibition which was comparable to that produced following acute in vivo exposure. The results indicate that acute P5N inhibition in lead-treated neonatal rats is due to noncompetitive P5N inhibition by lead. The inhibition of P5N produced by acute lead treatment is linearly related to blood lead concentrations.

15252003|t|Variations in risk-adjusted outcomes in a managed acute/long-term care program for frail elderly individuals.
15252003|a|OBJECTIVE: To develop and investigate the properties of three performance measures based on risk-adjusted health outcomes for a frail, elderly, community-dwelling population enrolled in a managed, acute, and long-term care program. DESIGN: Retrospective analyses of an administrative dataset containing individual level records with information about socioeconomics, health, functional and cognitive status, diagnoses, and treatments. We estimated risk-adjustment models predicting mortality, decline in functional status, and decline in self-assessed health. Each model includes individual risk factors and indicator variables for the program site in which the individual enrolled. Sites were ranked based on their performance in each risk-adjusted outcome, and the properties of these performance measures were investigated. SETTING: Twenty-eight sites of the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) that provide primary, acute, and long-term care services under capitated Medicare and Medicaid payment to a nursing home certifiable, and functionally and cognitively frail community-dwelling elderly population. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand one hundred and thirty-eight individuals who were newly enrolled between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1999. The average age of these enrollees was 78 years, 27% were male, 50% were diagnosed with dementia, and they had approximately 4 Activities of Daily Living limitations and 7.4 Instrumental Activities of Daily Living limitations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk-adjustment models, performance ranking for each site, and correlations between performance rankings. RESULTS: We present risk-adjustment models for mortality, change in functional status, and self-assessed health status. We found substantial variation across sites in performance, but no correlation between performance with respect to different outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The variations in outcomes suggest that sites can improve their performance by learning from the practices of those with the best outcomes. Further research is required to identify processes of care that lead to best outcomes.

12019007|t|Incidence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea following pharyngeal flap surgery in patients with cleft palate.
12019007|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) associated with pharyngeal flap surgery in patients with cleft palate at least 6 months postoperatively and to determine whether age or the flap width had an effect on them. The hypothesis tested in this study was that the severity of OSA associated with pharyngeal flap surgery is greater in children than in adults. SUBJECTS: Ten adults, six men and four women, with a mean age of 28.0 years at pharyngeal flap (adult group). Twenty-eight children, 13 boys and 15 girls, with a mean age of 6.3 years at pharyngeal flap (child group). DESIGN: A prospective analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: An overnight polysomnographic study was used to determine the incidence and severity of OSA 6 months after pharyngeal flap. RESULTS: The incidence of OSA following pharyngeal flap was high but not significantly different between these two groups (90% in adults and 93% in children, p = 1.000). When OSA was stratified into different levels of severity according to the values of respiratory disturbance index, there were noticeable differences between these two groups (p =.022). In the adult group, eight patients (89%) had mild OSA and 1 patient (11%) had moderate to severe OSA. In the child group, 11 patients (42%) were found to have mild OSA, and 15 patients (58%) had moderate to severe OSA. No relation was found between the flap width and the incidence (p =.435 in adults and.640 in children) or the severity (p =.325 in adults and.310 in children) of OSA in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Six months following pharyngeal flap surgery, more than 90% of the patients with cleft palate still had OSA. The severity of OSA associated with pharyngeal flap surgery tended to be greater in children than in adults. The flap width was unrelated to the incidence and severity of OSA, no matter in adults or in children.

12169535|t|Support vector regression applied to the determination of the developmental age of a Drosophila embryo from its segmentation gene expression patterns.
12169535|a|MOTIVATION: In this paper we address the problem of the determination of developmental age of an embryo from its segmentation gene expression patterns in Drosophila. RESULTS: By applying support vector regression we have developed a fast method for automated staging of an embryo on the basis of its gene expression pattern. Support vector regression is a statistical method for creating regression functions of arbitrary type from a set of training data. The training set is composed of embryos for which the precise developmental age was determined by measuring the degree of membrane invagination. Testing the quality of regression on the training set showed good prediction accuracy. The optimal regression function was then used for the prediction of the gene expression based age of embryos in which the precise age has not been measured by membrane morphology. Moreover, we show that the same accuracy of prediction can be achieved when the dimensionality of the feature vector was reduced by applying factor analysis. The data reduction allowed us to avoid over-fitting and to increase the efficiency of the algorithm.

10998167|t|Tyr-326 plays a critical role in controlling SecA-preprotein interaction.
10998167|a|SecA is an essential ATP-dependent motor protein that interacts with the preprotein and translocon to drive protein translocation across the eubacterial plasma membrane. A region containing residues 267-340 has been proposed to comprise the preprotein binding site of Escherichia coli SecA. To elucidate the function of this region further, we isolated mutants using a combination of region-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis and a genetic and biochemical screening procedure. Although this region displayed considerable plasticity based on phylogenetic and genetic analysis, Tyr-326 was found to be critical for SecA function. secA mutants with non-conservative substitutions at Tyr-326 showed strong protein secretion defects in vivo and were completely defective for SecA-dependent translocation ATPase activity in vitro. The SecA-Y326 mutant proteins were normal in their membrane, SecYE and nucleotide-binding properties. However, they exhibited a reduced affinity for preprotein and were defective in preprotein release, as assessed by several biochemical assays. Our results indicate that the region containing Tyr-326 functions as a conformational response element to regulate the preprotein binding and release cycle of SecA.

8181616|a|Primary bacterial arteritis with false aneurysm formation is an uncommon condition. This report presents seven patients admitted to one unit over a 5-year period. Interesting aspects of the clinical presentation are discussed. The importance of surgical debridement, extra-anatomic bypass, antibiotic therapy and antibiotic irrigation of the infected aneurysm cavity is stressed. The relative merits of extra-anatomic bypass and in situ grafting for aortic infection are discussed. By following these principles, this series of patients have had a successful surgical outcome and all the signs of infection have been eradicated.

3700896|t|Evaluation of the cause of nasal and ocular symptoms associated with lawn mowing.
3700896|a|A number of individuals with perennial or seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis state that their symptoms may suddenly worsen on exposure to lawn mowing. Many allergists have believed that this was related to the agitation of molds deposited on the grass. We studied 50 consecutive new patients with rhinitis using history, skin testing, total and specific IgE assays, and nasal smears. Twenty-five patients gave histories of minimal or no change in their nasal symptoms with exposure to lawn mowing, whereas 11 patients had definite, but mild, symptoms, and 14 patients had severe symptoms. Positive skin tests to grasses, trees, and weed pollens were more frequent in those patients with symptoms exacerbated by lawn mowing (p less than 0.03). Symptomatic patients also had higher serum concentrations of total IgE (p less than 0.008) and grass-pollen specific IgE (p = 0.0004). The frequencies of positive skin tests to ragweed pollens, house dust, molds, and grass leaves, as well as the percentage of nasal eosinophils, were not different in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. No significant association was found between symptoms and IgE antibodies to molds or grass-leaf extract. We believe that the increased nasal and ocular symptoms coincident with lawn mowing are allergic phenomena significantly associated with skin test sensitivity and specific IgE antibodies to grass pollens but not with sensitivity or specific IgE to molds or grass-leaf extract.

9427336|t|Neurotrophin-like immunoreactivity in the human trigeminal ganglion.
9427336|a|The localization of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) was demonstrated immunohistochemically in discrete neuronal subsets of the human trigeminal ganglion at ages ranging from 23 weeks of gestation to adulthood. Neurotrophin-containing subpopulations partially overlapped with each other and with those immunoreactive for the relevant trk receptor. Glial elements could also be immunostained, labelled satellite cells being particularly abundant in NT-3 stained sections. These results suggest that the neurotrophins are of functional significance for the human trigeminal primary sensory neurones throughout life. Their localization in the ganglion cellular components supports their function as target-derived trophic factors and as molecules effective in autocrine/paracrine interactions.

7399625|t|Effect of chronic hypertension and sympathetic denervation on wall/lumen ratio of cerebral vessels.
7399625|a|The purposes of this study were to determine whether 1) cerebral vessels undergo hypertrophy during chronic hypertension and 2) sympathetic nerves contribute to cerebral vascular changes in chronic hypertension. Morphometric studies were undertaken in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SP-SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Unilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy was performed in the SP-SHR at 8 weeks of age. When the rats were approximately 13 months old, they were killed and the brain was fixed with formalin at a perfusion pressure of 80% of the rat's systolic pressure. Wall/lumen ratio was measured in approximately 1200 arteries and arterioles. In parenchymal, but not pial, cerebral vessels there was pronounced vascular hypertrophy in SP-SHR: wall/lumen ratio was 0.08 in WKY and 0.14 in SP-SHR (p < 0.05). Sympathetic denervation attenuated the development of vascular hypertrophy in SP-SHR: wall/lumen ratio was 0.14 in the innervated parenchymal vessels, and 0.10 in denervated vessels (p < 0.05). We conclude that cerebral vessels undergo hypertrophy in stroke-prone SHR and speculate that vascular hypertrophy may protect cerebral vessels by reducing wall stress in chronic hypertension. Sympathetic nerves appear to exert a trophic effect on cerebral vascular muscle in chronic hypertension.

10376953|t|Induction of experimental autoimmune neuritis in CD4-8-C57BL/6J mice.
10376953|a|The C57BL/6J mice strain is known to be reputedly resistant to induction of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), an animal model of Guillain-Barre syndrome in humans. Here we describe the induction of EAN in mice of the C57BL/6J background by transfer into naive syngeneic recipients bovine peripheral nerve myelin (BPM)-primed donor lymph node cells that had been stimulated in vitro with the bovine peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin P2 protein peptide 57-81 followed by challenge with BPM, Freund's complete adjuvant and pertussis toxin. EAN was more severe, both clinically and histologically, and accompanied by extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells and demyelination in peripheral nerves when examined on day 30 after transfer of primed T cells from CD4- 8- mice into identical naive hosts than after transfer of cells from primed wild type, CD4-/- or CD8-/- mice to corresponding recipient animals. EAN in CD4-8- mice was also associated with elevated numbers of P2 peptide-reactive interferon-y (TFN-gamma) secreting cells and alphabeta T cells were present in lymph nodes and spleens. The data suggest that PNS myelin activated T cells from an EAN-resistant mice strain are capable of homing to the PNS. The expanded CD4-8- alphabeta T cells may have helper and effector functions, related to initiation of EAN in the CD4-8- mice. Lack of CD4+ and CD8+ expressing cells does not prevent the initiation of an autoimmune disease.

19095868|t|Biochemical and biological properties of 4-(3-phenyl-[1,2,4] thiadiazol-5-yl)-piperazine-1-carboxylic acid phenylamide, a mechanism-based inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase.
19095868|a|Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is an integral membrane enzyme within the amidase-signature family. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of several endogenous biologically active lipids, including anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide), oleoyl ethanolamide, and palmitoyl ethanolamide. These endogenous FAAH substrates have been shown to be involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including synaptic regulation, regulation of sleep and feeding, locomotor activity, pain and inflammation. Here we describe the biochemical and biological properties of a potent and selective FAAH inhibitor, 4-(3-phenyl-[1,2,4]thiadiazol-5-yl)-piperazine-1-carboxylic acid phenylamide (JNJ-1661010). The time-dependence of apparent IC(50) values at rat and human recombinant FAAH, dialysis and mass spectrometry data indicate that the acyl piperazinyl fragment of JNJ-1661010 forms a covalent bond with the enzyme. This bond is slowly hydrolyzed, with release of the piperazinyl fragment and recovery of enzyme activity. The lack of inhibition observed in a rat liver esterase assay suggests that JNJ-1661010 is not a general esterase inhibitor. JNJ-1661010 is >100-fold preferentially selective for FAAH-1 when compared to FAAH-2. JNJ-1661010 dose-dependently increases arachidonoyl ethanolamide, oleoyl ethanolamide, and palmitoyl ethanolamide in the rat brain. The compound attenuates tactile allodynia in the rat mild thermal injury model of acute tissue damage and in the rat spinal nerve ligation (Chung) model of neuropathic pain. JNJ-1661010 also diminishes thermal hyperalgesia in the inflammatory rat carrageenan paw model. These data suggest that FAAH inhibitors with modes of action similar to JNJ-1661010 may be useful clinically as broad-spectrum analgesics.

11904474|a|There is an interlacing in academic gynecology and obstetrics between Germany and Switzerland which leads back to the founding years of both societies. Germans have been elected to the chairs in Zurich, Bern, and Basel, whereas Swiss have been appointed to Erlangen, Leipzig, Dresden, and Frankfurt. Reservations from both sides, if any, were not prevailing. Even if the balance at present might show a trend again towards the Germans being chairmen at German-speaking Swiss Universities, the historical line contradicts the impression of one-sidedness. It is the academic exchange followed by a remarkable interlacing between the two German-speaking nations which will certainly continue into the future, all the more so in a Europe where historical differences are more or less overcome. The younger generation will extend and improve the links already laid down in the past. The men mentioned above have all been leading figures during their time, Fred Kubli so in particular. They will be followed by successors. Might they be as excellent as their predecessors have been.

8731573|t|[Asthma-related mortality in the city of Rosario]
8731573|a|Accuracy of death certification and registration have been investigated in many countries because death certificates constitute the unavoidable source for studying asthma mortality. The purposes of this study were: 1) to assess the reliability of official registration of asthma death certification and 2) to describe the percentage of asthma deaths occurring outside-hospital in Rosario during 1988. All death certificates from Rosario residents over 5 years old, in which appeared the word asthma or derivatives, were studied. The asthma mortality rates from 1981 to 1989 were obtained from the "Official annual publication". The diagnosis of asthma was written somewhere on 45 certificates; but 30 certificates were interpreted as asthma being the most appropriate diagnosis and could then be coded as the cause of death. These 30 asthma related deaths occurred at the mean age of 59.23 yrs +/- 17.23 (SD), range 12-84 yrs. Twenty-two deaths out of the total of 30 occurred in an out-hospital setting (73%). Among the 30 cases, 8 subjects (aged 63.0 yr +/- 12.38) died in hospital. There was no difference between the age, sex and the death place. Autopsy was performed in only one case of 12 years old. In other 3 cases, asthma was confirmed as the cause of death through the evaluation of case records and the confidential information collected from close acquaintances. The mean asthma mortality rate from 1981 to 88 in Rosario was 5.69 +/- 1.06/10(5), and this value was significantly higher than the death rate calculated by this study (3.46/10(5); p = 0.0005, T test for one sample). The difference probably originated in the false positive certificates often related to procedures in the General Registrar Office. In other words, there was an official overestimation of asthma deaths. This was the first description of the high percentage (73%) of asthma related deaths occurring in the out-hospital setting. Finally, even when death certificates should require a further and exhaustive assessment, asthma mortality rates in Rosario might be regarded as of great concern.

10611572|a|The 131I scan is the preferred test in the follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer patients although the many unusual circumstances of radioiodine uptake that can provide false positive results must be identified. We present the case of a woman who had undergone a thyroidectomy and was being treated for follicular carcinoma with an ablative dose os radioiodine whose pre- and post-treatment scans only revealed post-surgical residual thyroid tissues. A total body scan with 131I performed at one year demonstrated the success of the ablation. However, a left supra-orbital pathological deposit was observed during a subsequent routine 131I scan. The thyroglobulin serum level was below the sensitivity level for the assay (< 1 ng/ml) and the serum antibodies against thyroglobulin were not detected. A simple x-ray and bone scintigraphy were inconclusive. The CT and MRI revealed the presence of a mucocele in the left frontal sinus which was confirmed through histological examination. The possibility of a false positive results in an 131I scan must always be kept in mind, especially in the presence of atypical uptakes and undetectable thyroglobulin serum levels. As far as we know, only one similar case has been published previously.

11604532|t|Identification of disulfide-linked peptides by isotope profiles produced by peptic digestion of proteins in 50% (18)O water.
11604532|a|Determination of the disulfide-bond arrangement of a protein by characterization of disulfide-linked peptides in proteolytic digests may be complicated by resistance of the protein to specific proteases, disulfide interchange, and/or production of extremely complex mixtures by less specific proteolysis. In this study, mass spectrometry has been used to show that incorporation of (18)O into peptides during peptic digestion of disulfide-linked proteins in 50% (18)O water resulted in isotope patterns and increases in average masses that facilitated identification and characterization of disulfide-linked peptides even in complex mixtures, without the need for reference digests in 100% (16)O water. This is exemplified by analysis of peptic digests of model proteins lysozyme and ribonuclease A (RNaseA) by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS). Distinct isotope profiles were evident when two peptide chains were linked by disulfide bonds, provided one of the chains did not contain the C terminus of the protein. This latter class of peptide, and single-chain peptides containing an intrachain disulfide bond, could be identified and characterized by mass shifts produced by reduction. Reduction also served to confirm other assignments. Isotope profiling of peptic digests showed that disulfide-linked peptides were often enriched in the high molecular weight fractions produced by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the digests. Applicability of these procedures to analysis of a more complex disulfide-bond arrangement was shown with the hemagglutinin/neuraminidase of Newcastle disease virus.

18450927|t|Computer-assisted delivery of cognitive-behavioral therapy for addiction: a randomized trial of CBT4CBT.
18450927|a|OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the efficacy of a computer-based version of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for substance dependence. METHOD: This was a randomized clinical trial in which 77 individuals seeking treatment for substance dependence at an outpatient community setting were randomly assigned to standard treatment or standard treatment with biweekly access to computer-based training in CBT (CBT4CBT) skills. RESULTS: Treatment retention and data availability were comparable across the treatment conditions. Participants assigned to the CBT4CBT condition submitted significantly more urine specimens that were negative for any type of drugs and tended to have longer continuous periods of abstinence during treatment. The CBT4CBT program was positively evaluated by participants. In the CBT4CBT condition, outcome was more strongly associated with treatment engagement than in treatment as usual; furthermore, completion of homework assignments in CBT4CBT was significantly correlated with outcome and a significant predictor of treatment involvement. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CBT4CBT is an effective adjunct to standard outpatient treatment for substance dependence and may provide an important means of making CBT, an empirically validated treatment, more broadly available.

The i.p. injections of a "macrophage Ia-recruiting factor" induced exudates rich in Ia-bearing macrophages in both athymic and euthymic mice. These data suggest 2 levels of control of Ia-bearing macrophages: a basal T cell-independent level and a stimulated level dependent on mature T cells.

15210045|t|Prediction of successful menorrhagia treatment after thermal balloon endometrial ablation.
15210045|a|BACKGROUND: Thermal balloon endometrial ablation (TBEA) is a non-hysteroscopic technique, which relies on a combination of heat and pressure within the uterine cavity to destroy endometrium and superficial myometrium. It is a simple, easy and minimally invasive procedure with an equivalent effectiveness to hysteroscopic endometrial ablation. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of TBEA in the treatment of menorrhagia and to identify the possible predictive factors for a successful outcome after 2-year follow-up. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted, including 45 patients suffering from serious menorrhagia. Under local anesthesia with i.v. sedation, the Therma-Choice trade mark (Gynecare, Somerville, NJ, USA) balloon was inserted transcervically and after inflation in the endometrial cavity with 5% dextrose, it was heated to 87 degrees C for an 8-minute treatment cycle. RESULTS: There were no intraoperative complications and postoperative morbidity was minimal. At 2-year follow-up the overall improvement of menstrual pattern was 85%; with reported 29% amenorrhea, 23.5% hypomenorrhea and 32.5% euomenorrhea. Menorrhagia persisted in 15% of patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the factors that could affect the outcome showed that the chance for a successful treatment increased significantly with increased age (P = 0.044), shorter uterine depth (P = 0.049) and adequate balloon pressure (P = 0.027). These were the predictive factors for successful outcome. However, parity, uterine volume and endometrial thickness were not predictive factors. CONCLUSION: At 2-year follow-up, thermal balloon endometrial ablation is effective in menorrhagia treatment. Increased age, shorter uterine depth and adequate balloon pressure can be predictive factors for successful treatment.

7179854|t|[Indices of calcium and phosphorus balance in different variants of protein-vitamin deficiency]
7179854|a|The effect of unbalanced nutrition on mineral metabolism has been demonstrated. The leading role in the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis has been found to belong to vitamin D. It has been shown, however, that retinol, thiamine, riboflavine and pyridoxine as well as polyvitamin deficiencies are capable of producing an adverse effect on the calcium and phosphorus balance. Deficiency of food proteins results in an appreciable reduction in the blood mineral content and in another deterioration of the calcium and phosphorus balance. The studies have shown that different hypovitaminoses and protein deficiency are implicated in the development of rachitis.

2418020|t|Glucocorticoids increase cholecystokinin receptors and amylase secretion in pancreatic acinar AR42J cells.
2418020|a|We recently reported in AR42J pancreatic acinar cells that glucocorticoids increased the synthesis, cell content, and mRNA levels for amylase (Logsdon, C.D., Moessner, A., Williams, J.A., and Goldfine, I.D. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 100, 1200-1208). In addition, in these cells glucocorticoids increased the volume density of secretory granules and rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the present study we investigate the effects of glucocorticoids on the receptor binding and biological effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) on AR42J cells. Treatment with 10 nM dexamethasone for 48 h increased the specific binding of 125I-CCK. This increase in binding was time-dependent, with maximal effects occurring after 48 h, and dose-dependent, with a one-half maximal effect elicited by 1 nM dexamethasone. Other steroid analogs were also effective and their potencies paralleled their relative effectiveness as glucocorticoids. Analyses of competitive binding experiments conducted at 4 degrees C to minimize hormone internalization and degradation revealed the presence of a single class of CCK binding sites with a Kd of approximately 6 nM and indicated that dexamethasone treatment nearly tripled the number of CCK receptors/cell with little change in receptor affinity. Treatment with 10 nM dexamethasone increased both basal amylase secretion and the amylase released in response to CCK stimulation. In addition, dexamethasone increased the sensitivity of the cells to CCK. The glucocorticoid decreased the concentration of CCK required for one half-maximal stimulation of amylase secretion from 35 +/- 6 to 8 +/- 1 pM. These data indicate, therefore, that glucocorticoids induce an increase in the number of CCK receptors in AR42J cells, and this increase leads to enhanced sensitivity to CCK.

18448342|t|Support vector machines classification of hERG liabilities based on atom types.
18448342|a|Drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) can cause critical cardiovascular side effects and has accounted for the withdrawal of several drugs from the market. Blockade of the potassium ion channel encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) has been identified as a major contributor to drug-induced LQTS. Experimental measurement of hERG activity for each compound in development is costly and time-consuming, thus it is beneficial to develop a predictive hERG model. Here, we present a hERG classification model formulated using support vector machines (SVM) as machine learning method and using atom types as molecular descriptors. The training set used in this study was composed of 977 corporate compounds with hERG activities measured under the same conditions. The impact of soft margin and kernel function on the performance of the SVM models was examined. The robustness of SVM was evaluated by comparing the predictive power of the models built with 90%, 50%, and 10% of the training set data. The final SVM model was able to correctly classify 94% of an external testing set containing 66 drug molecules. The most important atom types with respect to discriminative power were extracted and analyzed.

16304867|t|Colorectal carcinoma, extent and spread in our population. Resection specimens give valuable information.
16304867|a|OBJECTIVE: To acquire information about the extent and spread of colorectal carcinomas in our population by examining colon and colorectum resection specimens received. METHODS: All colon and colorectum resection specimens received in the section of Histopathology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi from January 1, 2003 to July 31, 2003 were included in the study. RESULTS: Eighty five resection specimens were received during the study period, 69.41% patients were males, and 30.59% were females. The mean age for males was 49 years and for females 48 years. Tumor location was in left colon (58.82%), and in right colon (41.18%). The average size of the lesions in largest dimension was 5.5cms. Majority (83.53%) were colorectal adenocarcinomas, 71.76% cases were grade 11, 16.47% were grade I, and 11.76% were grade III. Most cases (85.88%) infiltrated full thickness of the bowel wall extending into the pericolonic fat. Vascular invasion was seen in 16.47% cases. Radial margin was positive in 23.08% of rectal carcinomas and 57.65% cases showed lymph node metastases. CONCLUSION: The findings in our study demonstrate that the disease is usually very advanced with extension into pericolonic fat and positive lymph nodes. Thus, the early detection and resection (while the disease is still in an early stage) are essential in our population using better surgical techniques, for proper staging of these tumors.

3897505|t|Scanning electron microscope evaluation of wear of dental curettes during standardized root planing.
3897505|a|Root planing relies upon the quality of instrument cutting edges. This study evaluated the sharpness and wear of some dental curettes available in the market following standardized root planing procedures. Nine working edges of nine Gracey No. 1/2 DE curettes, three each from three different manufacturers, were used as controls. These unused factory-sharpened edges were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Eighteen edges of nine curettes of the same brands were likewise examined after root planing procedures. Root planing was carried out on extracted one-rooted teeth mounted in natural positions in manikin jaws. Working areas measuring 3 X 5 mm were marked on root surfaces previously exposed by periodontitis. Root planing procedures included 15 vertical strokes done by either Side 1 or Side 2 of each instrument in relation to a single working area of a tooth, and the same procedure repeated 3 times using the opposite side of the curette. All working edges were examined at points 1 and 2 mm from the tip under 500 times magnification. Edge deformation increased significantly from the control group to the "15-stroke" group and from the "15-stroke" group to the "45-stroke" group. Factory-sharpened curettes (control) were sharp, with functional wire edges present on 55% of the specimens. After 15 strokes, nonfunctional wire edges and narrow edge deformations with bevels measuring less than 15 mu were present. After 45 strokes eight cutting edges (88.9%) showed bevels wider than 15 mu. The difference between the three brands was not significant in any group (i.e., controls, 15 strokes, 45 strokes). Further study is indicated to evaluate the relationships between bevel dimensions and root planing effectiveness.

18171150|t|Plants may alter competition by modifying nutrient bioavailability in rhizosphere: a modeling approach.
18171150|a|Plants modify nutrient availability by releasing chemicals in the rhizosphere. This change in availability induced by roots (bioavailability) is known to improve nutrient uptake by individual plants releasing such compounds. Can this bioavailability alter plant competition for nutrients and under what conditions? To address these questions, we have developed a model of nutrient competition between plant species based on mechanistic descriptions of nutrient diffusion, plant exudation, and plant uptake. The model was parameterized using data of the effects of root citrate exudation on phosphorus availability. We performed a sensitivity analysis for key parameters to test the generality of these effects. Our simulations suggest the following. (1) Nutrient uptake depends on the number of roots when nutrients and exudates diffuse little, because individual roots are nearly independent in terms of nutrient supply. In this case, bioavailability profits only species with exudates. (2) Competition for nutrients depends on the spatial arrangement of roots when nutrients diffuse little but exudates diffuse widely. (3) Competition for nutrients depends on the nutrient uptake capacity of roots when nutrients and exudates diffuse widely. In this case, bioavailability profits all species. Mechanisms controlling competition for bioavailable nutrients appear to be diverse and strongly depend on soil, nutrient, and plant properties.

9364069|t|Differential effects of abnormal tactile experience on shaping representation patterns in developing and adult motor cortex.
9364069|a|This study investigates the influence of early somatosensory experience on shaping movement representation patterns in motor cortex. Electrical microstimulation was used to map bilaterally the motor cortices of adult rats subjected to altered tactile experience by unilateral vibrissa trimming from birth (birth-trimmed group) or for comparable periods that began in adulthood (adult-trimmed group). Findings demonstrated that (1) vibrissa trimming from birth, but not when initiated in adulthood, led to a significantly smaller-sized primary motor cortex (M1) vibrissa representation in the hemisphere contralateral to the trimmed vibrissae, with no evidence for concomitant changes in size of the adjacent forelimb representation or the representation of the intact vibrissae in the opposite (ipsilateral) hemisphere; (2) in the contralateral hemispheres of the birth-trimmed group, an abnormal pattern of evoked vibrissa movement was evident in which bilateral or ipsilateral (intact) vibrissa movement predominated; (3) in both hemispheres of the birth-trimmed group, current thresholds for eliciting movement of the trimmed vibrissa were significantly lower than normal; and (4) in the adult-trimmed group, but not in the birth-trimmed group, there was a decrease bilaterally in the relative frequency of dual forelimb-vibrissa sites that form the common border between these representations. These results show that sensory experience early in life exerts a significant influence in sculpting motor representation patterns in M1. The mature motor cortex is more resistant to the type and magnitude of influence that tactile experience has on developing M1, which may indicate that such an influence is constrained by a developmentally regulated critical period.

1661619|t|Nerve growth factor enhances DNA synthesis in cultured cerebellar neuroblasts.
1661619|a|The cerebellar neuroblasts in primary cultures from five-day-old rats bore NGF receptor immunoreactivity, suggesting a potential responsive to NGF. At low plating density, NGF was found to enhance DNA synthesis in these cells in a dose-dependent manner. As these cells synthesize NGF, one possibility to account for the lack of response of neuroblasts plated at high density is that the amount of endogenous trophic agent produced in this culture condition is sufficient to ensure an optimal effect. The results demonstrate that premitotic neuroblasts in the CNS, as well postmitotic neurons, are responsive to NGF. At the early stage of its development, the cerebellum therefore appears to be a very good autocrine model of NGF action.

7919611|t|The screening programme for congenital hypothyroidism in Greece: evidence of iodine deficiency in some areas of the country.
7919611|a|Newborn screening for Congenital Hypothyroidism, using TSH measurement in dried blood spots, was started in Greece in 1979. A total of 1,274,000 neonates have been screened and 377 cases of Congenital Hypothyroidism were detected, for an incidence of 1:3370. Employing a cut-off point of 30 mU/L of TSH in whole blood, 0.3% of the infants were recalled for repeat examination. The sensitivity of the screening test was 0.99 and the predictive value of a positive test 0.1. The frequency of "false positive" cases in the different geographic regions of Greece showed wide variation between the south and the north areas of the country. We suggest that these differences reflect the degree of iodine deficiency in the population and may be used as an epidemiological indicator of this deficiency.

3368478|t|Parallel effects of DOCA on salt appetite, thirst, and blood pressure in sheep.
3368478|a|Salt appetite was quantified in sheep by measuring the relative amounts of high-salt (266 meq/kg) and low-salt (6 meq/kg) pelleted alfalfa that they ate. Given a choice of these two foods, normal sheep ate twice as much low-salt as high-salt pellets. Following DOCA administration the sheep rapidly developed an increased salt appetite, and after 10 days they ate approximately three times as much high-salt as low-salt pellets. Their choice rapidly reverted to control values after the end of the DOCA treatment. The changes in salt appetite were accompanied by changes in thirst and mean arterial pressure. We hypothesize that these effects of DOCA reflect changes that parallel those this mineralocorticoid causes in the hypothalamic regulatory centers for salt appetite, thirst, and blood pressure.

6208529|t|Toward a new understanding of vascular proliferative disease in children.
6208529|a|These studies provide the following evidence: (1) Angiogenesis is a multistep process. (2) The steps necessary to construct a capillary must occur in correct sequence, a motif that seems to be expressed entirely by vascular endothelial cells. (3) Primary tumors and their metastases are angiogenesis dependent, and angiogenesis may be a critical control point in tumor growth. (4) Heparin potentiates angiogenesis. (5) Heparin or its nonanticoagulant fragments, administered with cortisone, inhibit angiogenesis. (6) Heparin is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and yields low molecular weight fragments, some of which are absorbed into the circulation. (7) There is a group of corticosteroids that inhibit angiogenesis in the presence of a heparin fragment, but have no glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity. The compounds to which this new biologic activity has been assigned have been named "angiotropic" steroids. (8) There is a potential future role for angiogenesis inhibitors as a new class of pharmacologic agents.

5695066|t|Production of enterotoxin A in milk.
5695066|a|Enterotoxin A production in milk was studied by use of variables of milk quality, initial numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci, incubation temperature, and time. In both raw and pasteurized milks having a low total viable count, enterotoxin was detected in minimal incubation times of 6 to 9 hr at 35 C, 9 to 12 hr at 30 C, 18 hr at 25 C, and 36 hr at 20 C, after inoculation with 10(6)Staphylococcus aureus cells per ml. When similar milks were inoculated with 10(4)S. aureus cells per ml, enterotoxin was detected in 12 hr at 35 C, 18 hr at 30 C, 24 to 36 hr at 25 C, and 48 to 96 hr at 20 C. In high-count raw milk, enterotoxin was detected only in samples inoculated with 10(6)S. aureus cells per ml and incubated at 35 C. Generally, a concentration of 5 x 10(7)S. aureus cells per ml of milk was reached before enterotoxin A was detected.

15155376|t|Eukaryotic cells and their cell bodies: Cell Theory revised.
15155376|a|BACKGROUND: Cell Theory, also known as cell doctrine, states that all eukaryotic organisms are composed of cells, and that cells are the smallest independent units of life. This Cell Theory has been influential in shaping the biological sciences ever since, in 1838/1839, the botanist Matthias Schleiden and the zoologist Theodore Schwann stated the principle that cells represent the elements from which all plant and animal tissues are constructed. Some 20 years later, in a famous aphorism Omnis cellula e cellula, Rudolf Virchow annunciated that all cells arise only from pre-existing cells. General acceptance of Cell Theory was finally possible only when the cellular nature of brain tissues was confirmed at the end of the 20th century. Cell Theory then rapidly turned into a more dogmatic cell doctrine, and in this form survives up to the present day. In its current version, however, the generalized Cell Theory developed for both animals and plants is unable to accommodate the supracellular nature of higher plants, which is founded upon a super-symplasm of interconnected cells into which is woven apoplasm, symplasm and super-apoplasm. Furthermore, there are numerous examples of multinucleate coenocytes and syncytia found throughout the eukaryote superkingdom posing serious problems for the current version of Cell Theory. SCOPE: To cope with these problems, we here review data which conform to the original proposal of Daniel Mazia that the eukaryotic cell is composed of an elemental Cell Body whose structure is smaller than the cell and which is endowed with all the basic attributes of a living entity. A complement to the Cell Body is the Cell Periphery Apparatus, which consists of the plasma membrane associated with other periphery structures. Importantly, boundary structures of the Cell Periphery Apparatus, although capable of some self-assembly, are largely produced and maintained by Cell Body activities and can be produced from it de novo. These boundary structures serve not only as mechanical support for the Cell Bodies but they also protect them from the hostile external environment and from inappropriate interactions with adjacent Cell Bodies within the organism. CONCLUSIONS: From the evolutionary perspective, Cell Bodies of eukaryotes are proposed to represent vestiges of hypothetical, tubulin-based 'guest' proto-cells. After penetrating the equally hypothetical actin-based 'host' proto-cells, tubulin-based 'guests' became specialized for transcribing, storing and partitioning DNA molecules via the organization of microtubules. The Cell Periphery Apparatus, on the other hand, represents vestiges of the actin-based 'host' proto-cells which have become specialized for Cell Body protection, shape control, motility and for actin-mediated signalling across the plasma membrane.

The relative mobility of proteins remained unchanged, whilst the relative abundance of Band 3 and PAS-1 proteins decreased (stained with Coomassie blue and PAS). The adsorption of Band 3 on to quartz were dose- and time-dependent. Aluminium citrate can inhibit the quartz adsorptive activity. The results support that the membrane damage of quartz is related to interacting with Band 3 proteins.

1930366|t|A community screening test for high alcohol consumption using biochemical and haematological measures.
1930366|a|A discriminant function based on a number of biochemical and haematological tests from an extended multiple biochemical analysis and full blood count, together with weight, smoking status and systolic blood pressure is developed. The function was far more effective at detecting high alcohol use (greater than 40 g ethanol per day) than serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) or the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST) in a community sample of adult males. When classifying high alcohol consumption by GGT only, several division criteria were considered, the most effective being at 40 i.u./l. In terms of identifying high alcohol consumers, rather than alcoholics, the SMAST was no better than GGT, and both had unacceptably low sensitivity (49%, 51%) and poor performance on other measures, thus limiting their use as community screening tools. The discriminant function, however, had an estimated community sensitivity of 78%, was similarly high on other performance measures, and would perform satisfactorily as a community screening tool, particularly in situations where there was a tendency for individuals to under-report their alcohol consumption.

8876466|t|Estradiol increases the frequency of multiple synapse boutons in the hippocampal CA1 region of the adult female rat.
8876466|a|The effect of estradiol to increase the density of dendritic spines and axospinous synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in the adult female rat has been well-documented. However, presynaptic involvement in this process of synapse elimination and formation in the adult is unknown. To address this issue, we have reconstructed 410 complete presynaptic boutons through coded serial electron micrographs of CA1 stratum radiatum to determine the: (1) frequency of multiple (MSB) vs. single (SSB) synapse boutons; (2) number of synaptic contacts per MSB; (3) bouton volume and surface area; and (4) types of spines in synaptic contact with MSBs and SSBs in ovariectomized, estradiol-treated animals (OVX + E) versus ovariectomized oil-treated controls (OVX + O). Quantitative analysis of this tissue revealed that, in OVX + E animals, 45.0% of presynaptic boutons form multiple synaptic contacts with dendritic spines compared to 27.3% in controls (P < 0.01); the average number of synapses per dendritic spines compared to 27.3% in controls (P < 0.01); the average number of synapses per MSB was 2.7 in OVX + E animals compared to 2.3 in controls (P < 0.05). This represents a 25.5% increase in the number of synapses formed by a given number of presynaptic boutons in estradiol-treated animals (P < 0.01) which largely accounts for the previously observed estradiol-induced increase in axospinous synapse density. There was no treatment effect on bouton size; however, because MSBs are larger than SSBs, the increased frequency of MSBs in estradiol-treated tissue results in a trend toward an estradiol-induced increase in average bouton size. Additionally, MSBS were found to be more irregular in shape, i.e., significantly less spherical, than SSBs. Our results indicate that estradiol-induced dendritic spines form synapses primarily with preexisting boutons in stratum radiatum and that these boutons enlarge and change shape as they accommodate new synapses. Such findings suggest a relatively active role for dendrites in the process of adult synapse formation.

15718233|t|The crucial role of conserved intermolecular H-bonds inaccessible to the solvent in formation and stabilization of the TL5.5 SrRNA complex.
15718233|a|Analysis of the structures of two complexes of 5 S rRNA with homologous ribosomal proteins, Escherichia coli L25 and Thermus thermophilus TL5, revealed that amino acid residues interacting with RNA can be divided into two different groups. The first group consists of non-conserved residues, which form intermolecular hydrogen bonds accessible to solvent. The second group, comprised of strongly conserved residues, form intermolecular hydrogen bonds that are shielded from solvent. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce mutations into the RNA-binding site of protein TL5. We found that replacement of residues of the first group does not influence the stability of the TL5.5 S rRNA complex, whereas replacement of residues of the second group leads to destabilization or disruption of the complex. Stereochemical analysis shows that the replacements of residues of the second group always create complexes with uncompensated losses of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. We suggest that these shielded intermolecular hydrogen bonds are responsible for the recognition between the protein and RNA.

3994380|t|Glycosphingolipids of human plasma.
3994380|a|A number of glycosphingolipids, including 10 gangliosides, not previously identified in human plasma have been characterized. The plasma contains 2 micrograms of lipid-bound sialic acid/ml plasma and 54% of the gangliosides are monosialo, 30% disialo, 10% trisialo, and 6% tetrasialo. Individual glycosphingolipids were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography, and were characterized on the basis of their chromatographic mobility, carbohydrate composition, hydrolysis by glycosidases, methylation analysis, and immunostaining with anti-glycosphingolipid antibodies. The monosialogangliosides were identified as GM3, GM2, sialosyl(2-3)- and sialosyl(2-6)lactoneotetraosylceramides, sialosyllacto-N-nor-hexaosylceramide, and sialosyllacto-N-isooctaosylceramide. The major gangliosides in the polysialo fractions contained a ganglio-N-tetraose backbone and were identified as GD3, GD1a, GD1b, and GQ1b. The most abundant neutral glycosphingolipids were glucosyl, lactosyl, globotriaosyl, globotetraosyl and lactoneotetraosylceramides. The other neutral glycosphingolipids, tentatively identified by immunostaining with monoclonal antibodies, contained H1, Lea, Leb, and lacto-N-fucopentose III (X hapten) structures.

19002752|t|Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax associated with emphysema and ruptured bullae at the azygoesophageal recess.
19002752|a|PURPOSE: With secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) associated with emphysema, lesions responsible for pneumothorax can be located anywhere along the lung surface. Among such lesions, ruptured bullae at the azygoesophageal recess (AER) have received little attention thus far. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 38 right SSP patients with emphysema who underwent surgery. Among them, we reviewed the clinical characteristics and technical problems of patients with surgically proven ruptured bullae at the AER. RESULTS: Ruptured bullae at the AER were found in 10 of 38 patients. They accounted for 26.3% of all 38 patients and for 66.7% of 15 patients whose bullae at the AER were identified by preoperative computed tomography (CT). On CT, all the bullae were relatively large and oriented in a predominantly vertical axis. At surgery, they were confirmed as white, thin-walled structures originating from the mediastinal part of the apical segment of the right lower lobe. Surgery typically consisted of stapling bullectomy with video-assisted thoracic surgery. Technical problems in surgical treatment included poor mobilization of the base of the bulla and a restricted working space. CONCLUSION: Bullae at the AER are common and possibly lead to rupture. The presence of a bulla at the AER seen by CT can be predictive of rupture. Although the AER is a unique location, video-assisted bullectomy is the method of choice for treating these lesions.

1091900|t|Enchancement of deficient pituitary response to luteinizing hormone releasing hormone in patients with primary amenorrhea.
1091900|a|Although the absence of pituitary response to the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) test has been considered proof of a lesion primarily localized at the pituitary level, the possibility exists that an absent pituitary response may represent only the effect of a chronic deficiency of hypothalamic secretion. To verify this hypothesis, 4 patients with primary amenorrhea, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and deficient or absent responses to a 25 mug LHRH rapid IV test were treated with 400 mug LHRH infused in 7 hours during each of 3 successive days. The finding that patients with deficient LH responses to a rapid LHRH test became normally responsive to a second equivalent test after a slow and prolonged treatment with the decapeptide suggests that, in these patients, besides a lesion at the pituitary level, a primary defect at the hypothalamic or higher centers may also be suspected.

9206385|t|Revascularization of traumatized teeth assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry: case report.
9206385|a|Infection of the pulp space in addition to the attachment damage of a traumatic injury to a tooth, results in serious complications and often tooth loss. Therefore, the prevention or treatment of root canal infection is a major consideration in these cases. In immature teeth, revascularization of a necrotic pulp is possible and highly desirable. Unfortunately, current sensitivity tests are poor indicators of revascularization, with the result that many pulps are removed unnecessarily. Laser Doppler flowmetry is an objective test of the presence of moving red blood cells within a tissue, which has been reported to be effective in the detection of tooth pulp vitality as well. A case is presented where an eight year old child severely luxated both maxillary central incisors. While only one of the incisors was weakly responsive to CO2 ice at 76 days after replantation, the laser Doppler flowmeter indicated that revascularization was occurring in both teeth at a much earlier time. Because of the laser Doppler readings, endodontic treatment was not initiated and the teeth developed normally.

11278446|t|ATM-dependent phosphorylation of human Rad9 is required for ionizing radiation-induced checkpoint activation.
11278446|a|ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) is a Ser/Thr kinase involved in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. Human Rad9 (hRad9) is the homologue of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad9 protein that plays a critical role in cell cycle checkpoint control. To examine the potential signaling pathway linking ATM and hRad9, we investigated the modification of hRad9 in response to DNA damage. Here we show that hRad9 protein is constitutively phosphorylated in undamaged cells and undergoes hyperphosphorylation upon treatment with ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet light (UV), and hydroxyurea (HU). Interestingly, hyperphosphorylation of hRad9 induced by IR is dependent on ATM. Ser(272) of hRad9 is phosphorylated directly by ATM in vitro. Furthermore, hRad9 is phosphorylated on Ser(272) in response to IR in vivo, and this modification is delayed in ATM-deficient cells. Expression of hRad9 S272A mutant protein in human lung fibroblast VA13 cells disturbs IR-induced G(1)/S checkpoint activation and increased cellular sensitivity to IR. Together, our results suggest that the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of hRad9 is required for IR-induced checkpoint activation.

2223049|t|Neurones in the dorsal motor vagal nucleus of the cat with non-myelinated axons projecting to the heart and lungs.
2223049|a|Extracellular recordings were made from ninety-four single motoneurones in the dorsal motor vagal nucleus of chloralose-anaesthetized or decerebrate cats. Fifty-five neurones had axons in cardiac vagal branches and thirty-nine had axons in pulmonary vagal branches; the conduction velocities of the axons were in the C fibre range, i.e. the axons were non-myelinated. The neurons exhibited little or no spontaneous activity. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs were demonstrated by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve or its branches. Twenty-four neurones were tested by carotid sinus distension but only one was excited. Iontophoretic excitation of neurones projecting to cardiac vagal branches had no effect on heart rate. The properties of these neurones and their possible functions are discussed and contrasted with those of cardiac and pulmonary vagal motoneurones in the nucleus ambiguus.

3825674|a|Ninety-one delinquent adolescents were interviewed with respect to their personal and family drug use and criminal behavior. No significant gender differences with respect to drug use were found. Females, however, committed more crimes against property than did males. The drug use-delinquency association was explored and findings indicated that subjects saw a stronger causal relationship between drug use and subsequent criminal behavior than was found in the current study or past research. A multifactorial association between drug abuse and delinquency behaviors as part of a spectrum of sociopathic personality development was supported.

7651096|t|Sperm conservation and HIV infection.
7651096|a|In the course of preparing a medico-legal report in civil proceedings instituted by a couple contaminated by HIV, the case of Mr B. was brought to our attention. At the end of 1984 Mr B. had a serious accident in consequence of which he received a number of blood transfusions. The post-transfusion inquiry established blood contamination. Several years later (in 1990), and for reasons closely related to the above accident, Mr B. and his wife were having difficulty in having a child. They decided to resort to intraconjugal artificial insemination (IAI) first through a private laboratory and then through a CSCOS (Centre for the Study and Conservation of Human Ova and Sperm). In 1992 Mr B. and his wife were both found to be HIV positive; the infection was ascribed to the IAI, as the most plausible cause. In the face of such dramatic events, we wondered why neither the laboratory nor the CSCOS had checked whether the couple were HIV positive. Reflecting on this led us: (a) to make an inventory of the different organizations and facilities empowered to manipulate sperm for medically assisted procreation (MAP); (b) to investigate their obligation in terms of the prevention and control of specific diseases.

8067620|t|Plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide in relation to severity of mitral regurgitation in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.
8067620|a|Plasma concentration of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (ir-ANP) was investigated in 83 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with variable severity of mitral regurgitation caused by chronic valvular disease (CVD). Severity of mitral incompetence was assessed by echocardiography. Significant differences in plasma concentrations of ir-ANP were not found between clinically normal dogs (New York Heart Association functional class O), dogs with only cardiac murmur (class I), and dogs with echocardiographic evidence of slight to moderate left atrial and ventricular dilatation (class II). Dogs with severe left atrial and ventricular dilatation and clinical signs of congestion (classes III and IV) were found to have significantly (P < 0.001) increased plasma concentration of ir-ANP. Overall, moderate degree of association was found between plasma concentration of ir-ANP and left atrial and left ventricular diameters (Pearson's r = 0.65, 0.60, respectively, P < 0.001), as well as heart rate (r = 0.47, P < 0.01). However, left atrial enlargement was found to have the predominant effect on plasma ir-ANP concentration. It is concluded that the plasma concentration of ir-ANP did not become markedly increased before decompensation of chronic mitral regurgitation associated with severe enlargement of the left atrium and ventricle in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

10398682|t|Crystal structure of the conserved core of the herpes simplex virus transcriptional regulatory protein VP16.
10398682|a|On infection, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) virion protein VP16 (Vmw65; alphaTIF) forms a transcriptional regulatory complex-the VP16-induced complex-with two cellular proteins, HCF and Oct-1, on VP16-responsive cis-regulatory elements in HSV immediate-early promoters called TAATGARAT. Comparison of different HSV VP16 sequences reveals a conserved core region that is sufficient for VP16-induced complex formation. The crystal structure of the VP16 core has been determined at 2.1 A resolution. The results reveal a novel, seat-like protein structure. Together with the activity of mutant VP16 proteins, the structure of free VP16 suggests that it contains (1) a disordered carboxy-terminal region that associates with HCF, Oct-1, and DNA in the VP16-induced complex, and (2) a structured region involved in virion assembly and possessing a novel DNA-binding surface that differentiates among TAATGARAT VP16-response elements.

6860526|t|Postoperative ileus, pregnancy-related cholinesterase deficiency and suxamethonium after-pains. A case report.
6860526|a|An account is presented of a patient who developed ileus, of greater or lesser severity, after each of seven operations (including two extra-abdominal and three Caesarean sections). During her most recent pregnancy, reviewed here, her plasma cholinesterase activity was found to be decreased and it remained low until at least the 6th day post-partum. However, as the normal activity had been gained by 6 weeks after delivery, the phenomenon had evidently been pregnancy-related. Despite receiving suxamethonium by infusion to completion of her Caesarean section, she did not show an abnormally prolonged response, although she did suffer considerable suxamethonium "after-pains". The question is posed of a possible relationship between the postoperative ileus, muscle pains and the decrease in cholinesterase activity.

8469412|a|Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is readily absorbed through skin, and relieves musculoskeletal pain when applied topically to painful areas. We studied the effects of DMSO on C-type nerve fibers, which mediate pain sensation. DMSO was applied directly to exposed cat sural nerves. C fiber conduction velocity was slowed by DMSO, even in low concentrations (5-7% v/v). Higher concentrations completely blocked C fiber conduction, with a minimum blocking concentration of 9%. Onset of nerve block was almost immediate with 15% DMSO or higher concentrations. C fiber blockade may account for analgesia with DMSO.

12065870|t|Transcatheter arterial embolization with zinostatin stimalamer for hepatocellular carcinoma.
12065870|a|Zinostatin stimalamer (SMANCS) is a lipophilic intra-arterial chemotherapeutic agent for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our previous study, transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy using SMANCS for HCC showed a response rate of 20%. In an effort to obtain a superior anti-tumor effect against HCC, we conducted a phase II study of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) using SMANCS and gelatin sponge in 50 chemotherapy-naive patients with HCC. Four milligrams SMANCS plus 4 ml lipiodol emulsion was injected into the hepatic artery, followed by an injection of gelatin sponge. The responses were evaluated by computed tomography (CT) 1 month after treatment and thereafter every 3-4 months. One patient (2%) showed complete response and 15 patients (30%) had partial response resulting in an overall response rate of 32% (16/50; 95% confidence interval 19-45%). In 33 patients (66%), the disease remained stable, and 1 patient (2%) showed progressive disease. In 35 patients (70%), the rate of necrotic area to whole tumor was more than 50% according to the evaluation method using lipiodol accumulation in CT. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 90, 55 and 19%, respectively. Grade 3 hematological toxicity was observed as thrombocytopenia in 2 patients (4%). Grade 3 and 4 non-hematological toxicity (liver dysfunction) occurred in 17 (34%) and 7 patients (14%), respectively. TAE using SMANCS, which was well tolerated, may be an effective treatment for advanced HCC.

10933938|t|Role of vector in activation of T cell subsets in immune responses against the secreted transgene product factor IX.
10933938|a|Defining immune responses against the secreted transgene product in a gene therapy setting is critical for treatment of genetic diseases such as hemophilia B (coagulation factor IX deficiency). We have previously shown that intramuscular administration of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector results in stable expression of therapeutic levels of factor IX (F.IX) and may be associated with humoral immune responses against F.IX. This study demonstrates that intramuscular injection of an AAV vector expressing F.IX fails to activate F.IX-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in hemostatically normal or in hemophilia B mice, so that there is an absence of cellular immune responses against F.IX. However, transgene-derived F.IX can cause B cell responses characterized by production of T helper cell-dependent antibodies (predominantly IgG1, but also IgG2 subclasses) resulting from activation of CD4+ T helper cells primarily of the Th2 subset. In contrast, administration of an adenoviral vector efficiently activated F.IX-specific CTLs and T helper cells of both Th1 and Th2 subsets, leading to inflammation and destruction of transduced muscle tissue and activation of B cells as well. Therefore, vector sequences fundamentally influence T cell responses against transgene-encoded F.IX. In conclusion, activation of the immune system in AAV-mediated gene transfer is restricted to pathways mediated by F.IX antigen presentation through MHC class II determinants resulting in T and B cell responses that are more comparable to responses in the setting of protein infusion rather than of viral infection/gene transfer.

7390619|t|Induction of cell infiltration and acid hydrolase release into the peritoneal cavity of mice.
7390619|a|An injection of thioglycollate into the peritoneal cavity of mice produced a peak of exudate at 4 h, a peak of total leukocytes at 24 h when the predominant cell was the polymorphonuclear neutrophil, and a secondard macrophage phase beginning 2--3 days after thioglycollate. The release of N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.30) into the peritoneal fluid paralleled the macrophage phase. The amount of enzyme released was related to the dose of thioglycollate. Neither zymosan (400 micrograms) nor endotoxin (30 micrograms) produced a marked inflammatory response when injected into the peritoneal cavity.

9920270|t|Evolutionary molecular engineering by random elongation mutagenesis.
9920270|a|We describe a new method of random mutagenesis that employs the addition of peptide tails with random sequences to the C-terminal of enzyme molecules. A mutant population of catalase I from Bacillus stearothermophilus prepared by this method has a diversity in thermostability and enzyme activity equal to that obtained after random point mutagenesis. When a triple mutant of catalase I (I108T/D130N/1222T)-the thermostability of which is much lower than that of the wild type-was subjected to random elongation mutagenesis, we generated a mutant population containing only mutants with higher thermostability than the triple mutant. Some had an even higher stability than the wild-type enzyme, whose thermostability is considered to be optimized. These results indicate that peptide addition expands the protein sequence space resulting in a new fitness landscape. The enzyme can then move along the routes of the new landscape until it reaches a new optimum. The combination of random elongation mutagenesis with random point mutagenesis should be a useful approach to the in vitro evolution of proteins with new properties.

9781965|t|Comparison of the prognostic value of C-reactive protein and troponin I in patients with unstable angina pectoris.
9781965|a|This study assessed the prognostic value of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in unstable angina, and specifically in patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease. These biochemical parameters, which are related to myocardial injury or to systemic inflammation, may help in short-term risk stratification of unstable angina. We prospectively studied 195 patients with unstable angina, 100 of whom had angiographically proven coronary artery disease (with normal creatine kinase [CK] and CK-MB mass). Serum concentrations of cTnI (N < 0.4 ng/ml) and CRP (N < 3 mg/L) were measured at admission, 12, and 24 hours later. The rate of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, or emergency revascularization) was higher in patients with increased cTnI within the first 24 hours, regardless of the results of coronary angiography (23% vs 7%; p < 0.001). Conversely, events occurred at similar rates in patients with or without increased CRP. In patients with angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease, multivariate analysis showed that increased cTnI within 24 hours of admission (35 patients) was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events (odds ratio 6.7, range 1.7 to 27.3), but not cTnI levels at admission and CRP at 0, 12, and 24 hours. Thus, both in unselected patients with unstable angina and in patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease, increased cTnI within 24 hours of admission, but not CRP, is a predictor of in-hospital clinical outcome. We also found a temporal link between cTnI increase and late elevation of CRP, suggesting that systemic inflammation may partially be a consequence of myocardial injury.

17383950|t|Loss of myostatin (GDF8) function increases osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells but the osteogenic effect is ablated with unloading.
17383950|a|Myostatin (GDF8) is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth and mice lacking myostatin show a significant increase in muscle mass and bone density compared to normal mice. In order to further define the role of myostatin in regulating bone mass we sought to determine if loss of myostatin function significantly altered the potential for osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and in vivo. We first examined expression of the myostatin receptor, the type IIB activin receptor (AcvrIIB), in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from mouse long bones. This receptor was found to be expressed at high levels in BMSCs, and we were also able to detect AcvrIIB protein in BMSCs in situ using immunofluorescence. BMSCs isolated from myostatin-deficient mice showed increased osteogenic differentiation compared to wild-type mice; however, treatment of BMSCs from myostatin-deficient mice with recombinant myostatin did not attenuate the osteogenic differentiation of these cells. Loading of BMSCs in vitro increased the expression of osteogenic factors such as BMP-2 and IGF-1, but treatment of BMSCs with recombinant myostatin was found to decrease the expression of these factors. We investigated the effects of myostatin loss-of-function on the differentiation of BMSCs in vivo using hindlimb unloading (7-day tail suspension). Unloading caused a greater increase in marrow adipocyte number, and a greater decrease in osteoblast number, in myostatin-deficient mice than in normal mice. These data suggest that the increased osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs from mice lacking myostatin is load-dependent, and that myostatin may alter the mechanosensitivity of BMSCs by suppressing the expression of osteogenic factors during mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, although myostatin deficiency increases muscle mass and bone strength, it does not prevent muscle and bone catabolism with unloading.

15458102|t|Quantitative methodology of evaluating surgeon performance in laparoscopic surgery.
15458102|a|Quantitative performance and skill assessments are critical for evaluating the progress of surgical residents and the efficacy of different training programs. Current evaluation methods are subjective and potentially unreliable, so there is a need for objective methods to evaluate surgical performance. We identify a feasible method to measure kinematic data in the live operating room setting and to assess the repeatability of an analysis method based on a hierarchical decomposition of surgical tasks. We used an optoelectronic motion analysis system to acquire postural data and tool tip trajectories of one expert surgeon over a period of four months. To assess repeatability of performance measures, we created a hierarchical decomposition diagram describing the procedure in terms of surgical tasks, tool sequences and fundamental tool actions. From the kinematic data, we extracted characteristic measures of individual tool actions and compared these measured distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. The comparisons of distributions show consistent performance over time by a trained surgeon and little effect from patient variability, and so are likely reliable measures of performance. An expanded set of reliable kinematic measures will form the basis for quantifying surgical skill and should be useful in validating surgical simulations for use in training, certifying surgeons and designing and evaluating new surgical tools.

17206949|t|Does CDX2 expression predict Barrett's metaplasia in oesophageal columnar epithelium without goblet cells?
17206949|a|BACKGROUND: Intestinal metaplasia (Barrett's oesophagus), but not cardiac-type mucosa in columnar-lined oesophagus, is regarded as premalignant. As intestinal metaplasia and cardiac-type mucosa are endoscopically indiscernible, it is difficult to take targeted samples from columnar-lined oesophagus with consequently a risk of having undetected intestinal metaplasia. AIM: To investigate whether the intestinal markers CDX2, MUC2 and villin can predict the presence of undetected intestinal metaplasia in columnar-lined oesophagus. Methods Presence of intestinal metaplasia or cardiac-type mucosa was identified in 122 biopsy sets of columnar-lined oesophagus from 61 patients, collected at two subsequent follow-up upper endoscopies. CDX2, MUC2 and villin expression were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: All intestinal metaplasia samples (55) were positive for CDX2 and MUC2 and 32 of 55 for villin. CDX2 expression was detected in 23 of 67 (34%) samples with only cardiac-type mucosa. Detection of CDX2 in cardiac-type mucosa increased the likelihood of finding intestinal metaplasia in another biopsy set of columnar-lined oesophagus (odds ratio 3.5, 95% CI = 1.2-10, P = 0.02). MUC2 was positive in 13 of 23 (57%) of CDX2-positive cardiac-type mucosa samples, whereas villin was detected in seven of 23 (30%). CONCLUSIONS: CDX2 expression in cardiac-type mucosa might be able to predict the presence of undetected intestinal metaplasia in columnar-lined oesophagus, and thus may be a putative marker for the presence of intestinal metaplasia in the absence of goblet cells.

8278340|t|Accessibility and distribution of intraerythrocytic antigens of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes following mild glutaraldehyde fixation and detergent extraction.
8278340|a|Malarial antigens on the surface of infected erythrocytes have been described by many investigators. However, few of these antigens have been unambiguously demonstrated to be exposed on the surface of erythrocytes. This study demonstrates that mild glutaraldehyde fixation results in the cytoplasmic face of the host membrane becoming accessible to antibody under conditions that normally do not expose the cytoplasmic face of uninfected erythrocytes. These results indicate that caution should be used in interpreting data on the membrane disposition of malarial antigens. Detergent extraction of the glutaraldehyde-fixed erythrocytes results in an increased permeabilization such that malarial antigens on the parasite surface and within the cytoplasm of the infected erythrocyte are accessible to antibody. The accessibility of these antigens was demonstrated by both immunofluorescence and two-color flow cytometry. The antigens within the host cytoplasm were not diffuse but associated with patchy aggregates. Analysis of the antigens associated with the cytoplasmic aggregates by immunoelectron microscopy indicated that they were not associated with membrane-bound compartments. The fixation and permeabilization protocol described herein will have useful applications for the characterization and analysis of malarial antigens.

11812328|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the parent-offspring similarity of class II division 1 malocclusion. METHODS: On the basis of family units, the polygonic curves and superimposed graphs of parents with those of the offspring were compared. RESULTS: (1) Craniofacial structure of most parents of the class II division 1 patients have class II convex tendency. (2) The curves of the offspring resemble one or two of the parent's in 84% of the families, and the resemblance mainly concentrates in skeleton. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Class II division 1 malocclusion is characterized by familial aggregativity. (2) High probability of heredity exists in parent-offspring similarity, and we believe that hereditary factors dominate in skeletal area while in dental area there is a higher probability that environmental factors dominate.

11313594|t|Aminopyrimidine-carboxyl(ate) interactions in trimethoprim maleate, an antifolate drug.
11313594|a|In the title cocrystal, trimethoprim maleate [2,4-diamino-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidin-1-ium maleate], C(14)H(19)N(4)O(3)(+).C(4)H(3)O(4)(-), the trimethoprim molecule is protonated at N1. The carboxyl group of the maleate ion makes a specific double hydrogen bond of type N-H.O with the 2-amino group and the protonated N1 atom of the trimethoprim cation which is similar to the carboxylate-trimethoprim cation interaction observed in the complex of dihydrofolate reductase with trimethoprim. The pyrimidine moieties of trimethoprim cations are centrosymmetrically paired through a pair of N-H.N hydrogen bonds involving the 4-amino group and the pyridinium N3 atom of a symmetry-related molecule. One of the O atoms at the maleate carboxylate group bridges the 2-amino and 4-amino groups on either side of the paired trimethoprim cations. The other O atom of the carboxylate group forms an intramolecular O-H.O hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group. These characteristic hydrogen bonds result in infinite two-dimensional aggregation of rings into a supramolecular ladder, which is further crosslinked through weak C-H.O interactions with methoxy groups of neighbouring trimethoprim molecules to form a layered structure.

11806439|a|Penetrating wounds to the heart represent a significant surgical challenge because of their unique clinical course and the need for emergent operative care. This operative care, which may include cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), must be initiated in a prompt yet careful fashion to optimize outcome, while minimizing morbidity. Trauma, because of its unpredictable and non-routine nature, may present many challenges to the perfusionist in an attempt to anticipate surgical needs and requirements. In this case report, we describe the successful surgical repair of a cardiac nail gun injury, as well as strategies we feel are essential for the safe, successful, and timely application of emergent CPB.

18418421|t|Both enalapril and losartan attenuate sarcolemmal Na+-K+-ATPase remodeling in failing rat heart due to myocardial infarction.
18418421|a|To investigate the mechanisms underlying the depressed sarcolemmal (SL) Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in congestive heart failure (CHF), different isoforms and gene expression of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were examined in the failing left ventricle (LV) at 8 weeks after myocardial infarction (MI). In view of the increased activity of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in CHF, these parameters were also studied after 5 weeks of treatment with enalapril (10 mg x kg-1 x day-1), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and losartan (20 mg.kg-1.day-1), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, starting at 3 weeks after the coronary ligation in rats. The infarcted animals showed LV dysfunction and depressed SL Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. Protein content and mRNA levels for Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha2 isoform were decreased whereas those for Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha3 isoform were increased in the failing LV. On the other hand, no significant changes were observed in protein content or mRNA levels for Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha1 and beta1 isoforms. The treatment of infarcted animals with enalapril or losartan improved LV function and attenuated the depression in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha2 isoform as well as the increase in alpha3 isoform, at both the protein and mRNA levels; however, combination therapy with enalapril and losartan did not produce any additive effects. These results provide further evidence that CHF due to MI is associated with remodeling of SL membrane and suggest that the blockade of RAS plays an important role in preventing these alterations in the failing heart.

11965354|t|Chronic stress during prepubertal development: immediate and long-lasting effects on arterial blood pressure and anxiety-related behavior.
11965354|a|The present work was undertaken to study the immediate and long-lasting effects of environmental stress during prepubertal life in rats with inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension (ISIAH) and normotensive Wistar rats on blood pressure (BP) levels and anxiety-related behavior. Two models of chronic stress (21-32 postnatal days) were used: repeated handling (HS) and unpredictable stress (US) of daily exposures to a variety of mild physical or psychoemotional stressors. Rats were tested just after the end of the chronic stress period and then at the age of 4 months. Chronic prepubertal stress did not affect the basal or stress-induced BP levels in young or adult Wistar rats. In ISIAH rats, chronic stress during the early phase of hypertension development did not accelerate its formation and did not augment its manifestation in adults. Moreover, the basal BP was decreased in young and adult ISIAH rats exposed to HS or US as compared to the age-matched controls. No long-lasting effect on BP elevation under acute stress in adults was found. Plasma corticosterone levels at resting and acute stress conditions were not changed in adult rats that had experienced prepubertal stress. Hypertensive rats proved to be less anxious in the elevated plus-maze test. The immediate effects of chronic stress were similar in the two rat strains: HS had an anxiolytic action while US stimulated anxiety. Long-lasting consequences depended on the rat strain: the anxiolytic effect of HS was retained in Wistar rats and US caused a greater anxiety in adult ISIAH rats. The data do not evidence that symptoms of anxiety are related to the development and maintenance of stress-sensitive arterial hypertension in ISIAH rats.

11119296|t|Likelihood-ratio affected sib-pair tests applied to multiply affected sibships: issues of power and type I error rate.
11119296|a|"All-pairs" likelihood-ratio analyses, such as those performed by MAPMAKER/SIBS [Kruglyak and Lander, 1995], require that a sibship containing N affected siblings be split into N(N - 1)/2 sibships, each containing a different pair of affected sibs, before analysis. Each of these N(N - 1)/2 sibships may also contain the other affected sibs from the original sibship, coded as unaffected, to infer missing parental genotypes, as is done automatically in MAPMAKER/SIBS. Then, the use of the same individuals both as affecteds to test for linkage and, elsewhere, as unaffecteds to infer missing parental genotypes leads to negative correlations in the estimated identity by descent sharing among affected pairs from the same original multiplex sibship. This gives a conservative test of linkage, even when no downweighting is applied. Conversely, if the other affected sibs from the original sibship are omitted, the correlations are positive and the linkage test is anticonservative in the absence of weighting. True type I error probability also depends on marker informativity, typed parents, number of affected sibs included in the analysis, and the weighting scheme. This suggests the use of simulation, rather than asymptotic theory, to assess significance levels. The power of multiplex sibships relative to affected pairs increases with increasing phenocopy percentage, but the presence of typed unaffected sibs improves the relative power of multiplex sibships greatly only when penetrance is high. It was found that the 2/N weighting proposed by Suarez and Hodge [1979] increased power over an unweighted analysis in many situations, provided significance levels were adjusted appropriately by simulation.

6678338|a|Attempts are described to 'normalize' germfree mice by association with 3, 21 and 71 different intestinal bacterial cultures isolated from mice with an SPF flora. Germfree mice associated naturally with an SPF flora served as controls. Vital bacterial counts were determined by aerobic and anaerobic culture. Stomach and small intestine contained fewer bacteria per gram than caecum and large intestine. Aerobic vital counts from caecum and large intestine were higher in the experimental groups than in control mice. The aerobic and anaerobic flora in stomach and small intestine comprised mainly Gram-positive non-fusiform shaped rods. In the caecum and colon Gram-positive cocci predominated in the aerobic culture while in the anaerobic culture fusiform-shaped rods were prominent. Scanning electron microscopy of oesophagus, ileum, caecum and faeces demonstrated colonization of the oesophageal epithelium only after association with 71 bacterial strains; the filamentous bacteria present in the ileum of SPF mice were not found in the experimental groups and caecum and faeces contained mainly fusiform-shaped bacteria. Non-bacterial matter decreased in the caecum and faeces with increase in the complexity of the flora.

Of the 11 patients who received only one part of the concentrated high dose treatment (3 x 650 rads mid-line dose to the whole brain during 3 consecutive days and then, after a rest period of 3 weeks, 12 x 170 rads mid-line dose given in two weeks using classical fractionation, total dose 3990 rads), 9 (81.8%) responded favourably with average survival of 5 months. Of the 36 patients who received both parts of the concentrated high dose treatment, i.e. 3 x 650 rads mid-line dose in 3 consecutive days and then the same treatment repeated 3 weeks later. giving a total dose of 3900 rads, 31 (86.1%) responded favourably with an average survival of 5 months. This type of regimen, using the two-part concentrated high dose treatment ("split course therapy"), not only spectacularly alleviated neurological signs and symptoms but had the added advantage of appreciably reducing the patients' stay in hospital.

8906543|a|SK-N-BE cells were differentiated (D) to neurons with retinoic acid. Total n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially arachidonic acid (AA), were increased in D versus ND cells. AA synthesis from linoleic acid (LA) and phospholipid (PL) synthesis from glycerol were initially elevated, whereas both processes were reduced approaching differentiation. At this stage, the incorporation of glycerol in triglycerides was enhanced. Formation of long chain PUFA and synthesis of acceptors (PL) for esterification, during RA-induced SK-N-BE differentiation, appear to be associated.

4048279|t|Dielectric properties of low-water-content tissues.
4048279|a|The dielectric properties of two low-water-content tissues, bone marrow and adipose tissue, were measured from 1 kHz to 1 GHz. From 1 kHz to 13 MHz, the measurements were performed using a parallel-plate capacitor method. From 10 MHz to 1 GHz, a reflection coefficient technique using an open-ended coaxial transmission line was employed. The tissue water contents ranged from 1 to almost 70% by weight. The dielectric properties correlate well with the values predicted by mixture theory. Comparison with previous results from high-water-content tissues suggests that bone marrow and adipose tissues contain less motionally altered water per unit dry volume than do the previously studied tissues with lower lipid fractions. The high degree of structural heterogeneity of these tissues was reflected in the large scatter of the data, a source of uncertainty that should be considered in practical applications of the present data.

16103028|t|Expression of the Ian family of putative GTPases during T cell development and description of an Ian with three sets of GTP/GDP-binding motifs.
16103028|a|Reports suggest that two members of the novel immune-associated nucleotide (Ian) GTPase family, Ian1 and Ian5, play roles in T cell development. We performed real-time PCR analysis of the expression of Ian genes of the rat during T cell maturation, in macrophages and in cell lines. We found that all of the genes were expressed at relatively low levels at the early double-negative thymocyte stage but were expressed more strongly at later cell stages. Our study also revealed the fact that the previously reported Ian9, Ian10 and Ian11 genes are, instead, parts of a single gene for which we retain the name Ian9, potentially encoding a GTPase with a highly unusual triplicated structure. Antisera were developed against both Ian1 and Ian9. We established that Ian9 is produced as an approximately 75-kDa protein in both T cells and thymocytes. We observed that levels of both Ian1 and Ian9 proteins are profoundly reduced in T cells from lymphopenic rats as compared with wild-type rats. It was demonstrated that thymocytes and B cells from lymphopenic rats (Ian5 null) did not show enhanced sensitivity to gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis.

2845135|t|Expression of bovine herpesvirus 1 glycoproteins gI and gIII in transfected murine cells.
2845135|a|Genes encoding two of the major glycoproteins of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), gI and gIII, were cloned into the eucaryotic expression vectors pRSVcat and pSV2neo and transfected into murine LMTK- cells, and cloned cell lines were established. The relative amounts of gI or gIII expressed from the two vectors were similar. Expression of gI was cell associated and localized predominantly in the perinuclear region, but nuclear and plasma membrane staining was also observed. Expression of gI was additionally associated with cell fusion and the formation of polykaryons and giant cells. Expression of gIII was localized predominantly in the nuclear and plasma membranes. Radioimmunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of tunicamycin revealed that the recombinant glycoproteins were proteolytically processed and glycosylated and had molecular weights similar to those of the forms of gI and gIII expressed in BHV-1-infected bovine cells. However, both recombinant glycoproteins were glycosylated to a lesser extent than were the forms found in BHV-1-infected bovine cells. For gI, a deficiency in N-linked glycosylation of the amino-terminal half of the protein was identified; for gIII, a deficiency in O-linked glycosylation was implicated. The reactivity pattern of a panel of gI- and gIII-specific monoclonal antibodies, including six which recognize conformation-dependent epitopes, was found to be unaffected by the glycosylation differences and was identical for transfected or BHV-1-infected murine cells. Use of the transfected cells as targets in immune-mediated cytotoxicity assays demonstrated the functional recognition of recombinant gI and gIII by murine antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Immunization of mice with the transfected cells elicited BHV-1-specific virus-neutralizing antibody, thus verifying the antigenic authenticity of the recombinant glycoproteins and the important role of gI and gIII as targets of the immune response to BHV-1 in this murine model system.

7060010|t|Formation and removal of (guan-8-yl)-DNA-2-acetylaminofluorene adducts in liver and kidney of male rats given dietary 2-acetylaminofluorene.
7060010|a|Radioimmunoassay has been used to measure acetylated and deacetylated deoxyguanosine C-8 DNA adducts of 2-acetylaminofluorene in liver and kidney DNA of male Wistar-Furth rats fed a dietary regimen of 0.02 or 0.04% 2-acetylaminofluorene. When adduct formation was monitored during continuous feeding up to 60 days, substantial levels of binding (80 fmol/microgram DNA) were observed in liver by 1 day, and maximum steady-state values averaging 230 fmol/microgram DNA were reached by 30 days. Initially, during the continuous feeding, about 80% of the total C-8 adducts were deacetylated [N-deoxyguanosin(8-yl)aminofluorene], and this proportion increased to about 97% by 15 and 30 days of administration of 0.04 and 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene diets, respectively. Levels of C-8 adducts bound to kidney DNA in the same animals averaged 10 to 15% of the liver values with greater than or equal to 80% of these adducts in the deacetylated form. In separate experiments, rats were exposed to 2-acetylaminofluorene for 3, 7, 28, and 112 days; the carcinogen-containing diet was discontinued; and C-8 adducts were monitored during 1, 7, and 28 days of feeding control diet. At both carcinogen doses, after dietary administration for 3 or 7 days, there was a rapid decrease in liver C-8 adducts so that, after 28 days on control diet, 65 to 90% of the original adducts were no longer present in the DNA. In contrast, in animals fed 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene for 28 days, there were high levels (70 to 100% of the original C-8 adduct) remaining on the DNA at the end of 28 days on control diet. This apparent loss in capacity for removal of C-8 adducts is discussed in relation to biological and biochemical changes induced in the rat liver during 2-acetylaminofluorene hepatocarcinogens.

1747877|t|Coronary pressure-flow, pressure-function, and function-myocardial oxygen consumption relations in postischaemic myocardium.
1747877|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE--The aim was to study coronary pressure-flow, pressure-myocardial wall motion and myocardial wall motion-myocardial oxygen consumption relations in postischaemic myocardium with prolonged myocardial dysfunction (stunned myocardium) in comparison with normal myocardium. DESIGN--Regional myocardial wall thickening was measured with ultrasonic crystals, and postischaemic myocardial dysfunction was achieved by occlusion of a carotid-left anterior descending coronary artery bypass (15 min) and reperfusion (30 min). Coronary perfusion pressure was decreased in 10 mm Hg steps by constricting the bypass before and after producing postischaemic myocardial dysfunction. At each constriction step, coronary flow, regional wall thickening, and regional myocardial oxygen consumption in the area perfused by the left anterior descending artery were measured. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIAL--12 anaesthetised open chest mongrel dogs, weighing 12-16 kg, were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--At the basal level, myocardial wall thickening of postischaemic myocardium was depressed compared to normal myocardium, at 18.5(SD 8.9)% v 1.3(7.1)%, p less than 0.01. With coronary stenosis, wall thickening gradually decreased at a coronary pressure below 60 mm Hg in normal myocardium, but remained unchanged until mean coronary pressure was reduced to 50 mm Hg in postischaemic myocardium. Myocardial wall thickening of postischaemic myocardium was always more depressed than normal myocardium. At any level of coronary pressure, coronary flow in postischaemic myocardium was not different from normal myocardium. There was no difference in regional myocardial oxygen consumption between normal and postischaemic myocardium at any level of coronary pressure. However, regional myocardial oxygen consumption in postischaemic myocardium was higher than in normal myocardium performing similar levels of myocardial wall thickening. CONCLUSION--The coronary pressure-function relation but not the pressure-flow relation changed in postischaemic myocardium after a 15 min coronary occlusion. Regional myocardial oxygen consumption was relatively increased in postischaemic myocardium.

8198049|t|Efficacy of water-soluble vitamin E in the treatment of vitamin E malabsorption in short-bowel syndrome.
8198049|a|A water-soluble form of vitamin E, tocopheryl succinate polyethylene glycol 1000 (TPGS), was used as an oral vitamin E supplement in a 71-y-old patient with severe fat malabsorption and vitamin E deficiency secondary to short-bowel syndrome. An absorption test with deuterium-labeled TPGS demonstrated that TPGS was absorbed and the released alpha-tocopherol was transported normally in lipoproteins. The disappearance portion of the deuterated alpha-tocopherol curves were parallel to those in control subjects, suggesting normal metabolic turnover of alpha-tocopherol. Long-term (3 y) supplementation with orally administered TPGS (10,360 mg or 4000 IU/d) maintained normal plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations, raised adipose tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations, and prevented further progression of the neurological abnormalities resulting from vitamin E deficiency. Thus, TPGS can be an effective vitamin E supplement in short-bowel syndrome despite severe fat malabsorption.

9851950|t|Ten-year follow-up of the first megatrial testing thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction: results of the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto-1 study. The GISSI Investigators.
9851950|a|BACKGROUND: We conducted a 10-year follow-up of the 11 712 patients with acute myocardial infarction randomized in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto-1 study, the first large trial assessing thrombolytic therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Information on survival at 10 years was obtained for the 93% of all randomized patients through the census offices of their towns of residence. The difference in survival produced by streptokinase and sustained up to 1 year was still significant at 10 years (log-rank test, P=0.02), with the absolute benefit of 19 (95% CI 1 to 37) lives saved per 1000 patients treated. The time dependence of the extent of the benefit was confirmed, as the higher mortality rate reductions found in patients treated earlier were still present at 10 years. In the overall population, most of the benefit was obtained before hospital discharge (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.90), since no difference in survival between thrombolyzed and control patients discharged alive was found at 10 years (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.06). However, a slight albeit nonsignificant divergence of the survival curves of patients randomized within the first hour was observed [90 (95% CI 34 to 146) lives saved per 1000 at 10 years versus 72 (95% CI 37 to 107) lives saved at hospital discharge]. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of a single intravenous infusion of 1.5 million units of streptokinase in prolonging survival of patients with acute myocardial infarction is sustained up to 10 years, with a still-evident trend in favor of the patients admitted earlier.

9687925|t|[Iatrogenic lesions of the bile ducts in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therapeutic potential of interventional radiology]
9687925|a|PURPOSE: We investigated the efficacy of interventional radiology procedures in some patients with iatrogenic injuries of the biliary tree from laparoscopic cholecystectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the last two years, 8 patients with complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy were treated in the Department of Radiology of Umberto I Hospital, Ancona, Italy. Five of them had a subhepatic biliary collection due to a cystic duct stump leak, 2 has a leak of the Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (from a iatrogenic injury of the common biliary duct) and 1 had a right hepatic biliary duct stricture from a clip. In the patients with a cystic duct stump leak, we treated the biloma with percutaneous catheter drainage and the endoscopist positioned a nasobiliary tube, while a percutaneous abdominal catheter was positioned to drain the biloma and a percutaneous transhepatic catheter was positioned through the biliary duct tract or through the hepaticojejunostomy. RESULTS: All injuries were completely repaired within 5-8 weeks of the procedure. There were no maneuver-related complications. All patients had normal serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and transaminase at the monthly follow-up tests performed for 3 months. US and MR cholangiopancreatography at 3 months excluded strictures, fistulas or bilomas of the biliary tree. DISCUSSION: The prompt detection of the injuries is essential to the success of interventional radiology procedures: the patients are less debilitated, small caliber catheters can be used and recovery is quicker. The combined effort of surgeons, endoscopists and radiologists is necessary to optimize the management of patients with laparoscopic cholecystectomy-related biliary complications. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained positive results with minimally invasive procedures costing less than another operation. Thus, we suggest that interventional radiology procedures become the method of choice in patients with iatrogenic injuries of the biliary tree after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

6643527|t|The use of ligament efficiency to model fenestrations in the internal elastic lamina of cerebral arteries. II--analysis of the spatial geometry.
6643527|a|During uniaxial extension of the latex model, the holes (both marked on the sheet and perforated) demonstrated a distinctive change in their shape, from circular to elliptical. Measurements of the axial and transverse diameters of a consistent row of holes, along with the width of the sample at distinct elongations were converted into an area, ligament efficiency (transverse and axial) and shape factor (eccentricity). Values for the expansion ratio of the holes and necking of the latex sheet were also computed. The perforations expanded more rapidly than with the holes only marked on the solid material, which translated into a more rapid increase for the axial diameter, area and eccentricity, while the axial ligament efficiency decreased more rapidly. The transverse diameter and transverse ligament efficiency remained essentially constant. Necking of the latex sheet was consistent for all of the specimens (both solid and perforated). The relative expansion ratios paralleled the relative changes for the standardized stresses presented in Part I.

16777217|t|Biodegradation of poly(anhydride-esters) into non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and their effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in vitro and on the foreign-body response in vivo.
16777217|a|The ability of poly(anhydride-esters) composed of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that biodegrade to salicylic acid (SA) and adipic acid to prevent colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and their effects on the foreign-body response were studied in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Soluble SA in bacterial medium at concentrations up to 300 mg/L did not affect the growth rate or viability of P. aeruginosa, indicating that SA does not exhibit a direct toxicity effect on the bacterium. Batch degradation rates of the salicylate-based polymer in the presence of an actively growing bacterial culture only marginally (14%) increased relative to polymer degradation rates in sterile medium. Short-term (3h) bacterial adhesion studies in agitated batch systems indicated a 47% reduction in the rate of P. aeruginosa adhesion relative to a control polymer that does not release SA upon biodegradation. Long-term (3-day) biofilm accumulation studies indicated a dramatic reduction in biofilm formation on salicylate-based polymer versus controls. A recombinant P. aeruginosa pMHLAS, containing a fluorescent reporter gene prior to the las regulon, was employed to determine whether salicylate-based polymer prevents biofilm formation by the released SA inhibiting quorum sensing pathways. Long-term biofilm accumulation studies with P. aeruginosa pMHLAS insinuate that salicylate-based polymer prevents biofilm accumulation by inhibiting the las quorum sensing system. Furthermore, unlike control polymer, salicylate-based polymer implanted subcutaneously for a period of 4 weeks-resisted cell-mediated degradation and remained intact. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis indicated a reduction in overall encapsulation and paucity of macrophages in the area of the salicylate-based polymer implant.

3484740|t|Role of the nucleoside transport function in the transport and salvage of purine nucleobases.
3484740|a|Genetic deficiencies in the nucleoside transport function markedly altered the abilities of cultured mutant S49 T lymphoblasts to transport, incorporate, and salvage exogenous hypoxanthine. The concentrations of exogenous hypoxanthine required to reverse azaserine toxicity and replenish azaserine-depleted nucleoside triphosphate pools in AE1 cells, a nucleoside transport-deficient clone, were about 10-fold higher than those required for wild type cells. In a similar fashion, guanine could reverse mycophenolic acid toxicity in wild type but not in AE1 cells. Surprisingly, a second nucleoside transport-deficient clone, 80-5D2, which had lost 80-90% of its ability to transport nucleosides, required lower hypoxanthine concentrations than the wild type parent to reverse these azaserine-mediated effects. The addition of submicromolar concentrations of either p-nitrobenzylthioinosine or dipyridamole, two potent inhibitors of nucleoside transport, to wild type cells mimicked the phenotype of the AE1 cells with respect to hypoxanthine. AE1 cells or p-nitrobenzylthioinosine-treated wild type cells could only transport hypoxanthine at 10-25% the rate of untreated wild type cells, whereas 80-5D2 cells could transport hypoxanthine more efficiently. Adenine transport was also diminished in AE1 and FURD-80-3-6 cells, but not to sufficiently low levels to interfere with their ability to salvage adenine to overcome azaserine toxicity. These studies on S49 cells altered in their nucleoside transport capacity provide powerful genetic evidence that purine nucleobases share a common transport function with nucleosides in these mammalian T lymphoblasts.

9103949|t|Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.
9103949|a|The prevalence of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is about 0.2%. The most common cause is Graves' disease. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality may be reduced to a minimum with careful attention to the clinical symptoms and interpretation of thyroid tests. Ideally, hyperthyroid women should be rendered euthyroid before considering conception. The incidence of maternal and neonatal morbidity is significantly higher in those patients whose hyperthyroidism is not medically controlled. Even the incidence of thyroid storm is high in women who are under poor medical supervision in the presence of a medical or obstetric complication. Maternal morbidity includes a higher incidence of toxemia, premature delivery, placenta abruptio, congestive heart failure, and thyroid crisis. In some series, anemia and infections were also reported. Neonatal morbidity includes SGA neonates, intrauterine growth retardation, LBW infants, and prematurity. Fetal goiter and transient neonatal hypothyroidism is occasionally reported in infants of mothers who have been overtreated with ATD. Propylthiouracil and MMI are equally effective in controlling the disease. In most patients, symptoms improved and thyroid tests returned to normal in 3-8 weeks after initiation of therapy. Resistance to ATD is extremely rare, most cases are caused by patient poor compliance. Surgery for the treatment of hyperthyroidism is reserved for the unusual patient who is allergic to both ATD; to those who have large goiters; to those who require large doses of ATD; or to those patients who poorly comply. Fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism can be predicted in the majority of cases by the previous maternal medical and obstetric history and by the proper interpretation of thyroid tests. Finally, hyperthyroidism may recur in the postpartum period.

3872944|t|Enhanced regeneration of transplanted splenic tissue by increased work load to the splenic compartments.
3872944|a|Autologous splenic tissue regenerates after subperitoneal transplantation in laboratory animals and in man. Qualitatively it resembles normal splenic tissue but the quantity usually only attains a small proportion of the normal spleen. In the prevention of overwhelming post-splenectomy sepsis a critical mass and a considerable blood flow to the regenerated spleen seem to be essential. By increasing the work load to splenic transplants in rats, significantly more splenic tissue was regenerated. This was achieved by: stimulating the white pulp by repetitive injections of xenogeneic red cells; stimulating the red pulp by damaging red cells with phenylhydrazine; a combination of 1 and 2; and stimulating the reticuloendothelial system by IP injections of methylcellulose. Stimulating the red pulp and the reticuloendothelial system were more effective than the injection of antigens. As the splenic mass is obviously regulated by the work load, we conclude that this effect should be used to attain the critical splenic mass and to increase the blood flow for effective clearance of bacteria from the blood.

12734256|t|Identification and characterization of a new variant of Shiga toxin 1 in Escherichia coli ONT:H19 of bovine origin.
12734256|a|A new variant of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1), designated Stx1d, which deviates considerably more than any other known variant from Stx1 encoded by phage 933J, was identified in an Escherichia coli strain, ONT:H19, isolated from bovine feces. The complete stx(1) gene of this strain was amplified and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence homology with stx(1) from phage 933J was only 91%, resulting in the substitution of 20 amino acids in the A subunit and 7 amino acids in the B subunit of the protein. Cell culture supernatant of this strain, which was negative for stx(2) by PCR testing, was cytotoxic to Vero cells and gave positive results in two commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for Stx. PCR primers were constructed for the specific detection of the new variant. The findings of this study suggest that Stx1 is not as conserved as thought before and that there might be more variants which cannot be detected by commonly used PCR methods.

9206764|t|[The PAPNET system in cytological rescreening of cervical smears]
9206764|a|BACKGROUND: The Papanicolaou test has reduced mortality from cervical cancer but has not completely eradicated the disease. A reason for the false negative screening errors may be found in one of three steps of the test (obtaining, processing and interpretation of the cervicovaginal smears). The possible false negative primary screening errors may be detected with the help of rescreening. Therefore, an automated quality control by means of a system such as in the PAPNET is necessary. The PAPNET combines the use of algorithmic image analysis with neural networks and allows to conventionally reassess cervicovaginal smears. Nevertheless, the cytopathologist always decides whether to reassess the sample with the optic microscope as suggested by the presence of abnormal cells in the frames selected by the PAPNET system. Therefore the cytopathologist always formulates the conclusive diagnosis. METHODS: In this study, we rescreened 300 cervicovaginal smears. RESULTS: Only 122 smears have been reassessed by the optic microscope. The human papillomavirus infection and the SIL (squamous Intraepithelial Lesion) diagnoses formulated by means of rescreening with the PAPNET have coincided with the primary screening diagnoses. The only exception was a human papillomavirus infection not previously detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the use of the PAPNET system facilitates the quality control measures and has reduced the false negatives.

2492104|t|Structure of the NGFI-A gene and detection of upstream sequences responsible for its transcriptional induction by nerve growth factor.
2492104|a|The NGFI-A gene encodes a "zinc-finger" protein that is rapidly induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. The complete exon/intron organization and nucleotide sequence of the rat NGFI-A gene have been determined. The gene spans 3789 nucleotides (nt) and is interrupted by a single intron at nt 588. All three zinc-finger DNA-binding domains are contiguously coded for within the 3' exon; this is in contrast to the structure described by others for the Xenopus laevis transcription factor TFIIIA gene. To analyze the transcription of this gene, we have determined the transcription start site and nucleotide sequence of the 5' flanking region. Transfection of PC12 cells with a fragment from the 5' flanking region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene revealed that it contains an element which imparts an NGF-inducible phenotype to the normally silent CAT gene. Several regions with homologies to recognizable sequence elements are present in this fragment, including a TATA box at nt -27, serum response elements at nt -84, -106, -370, and -408, a cAMP-responsive element at nt -140, and a transcription factor Sp1-binding site at nt -286. These results establish the genomic structure of this mammalian multifinger protein and demonstrate that an NGF-responsive element lies upstream of the NGFI-A gene.

11557236|t|Characteristics of L-aspartate transport and expression of EAAC-1 in sarcolemmal vesicles and isolated cells from rat heart.
11557236|a|OBJECTIVE: L-Aspartate is an important intermediary metabolite in the heart and has also been implicated in myocardial protection, but little is known about its transport across the cardiac sarcolemma. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that the high affinity sodium-dependent aspartate transporter, EAAC-1 is expressed in heart and have also characterised aspartate transport into the myocardium. METHODS: Characteristics of L-[14C]aspartate uptake into rat heart were investigated using sarcolemmal vesicles and isolated myocytes. The expression of EAAC-1 in the two preparations was also investigated by western blotting. RESULTS: The K(m) and V(max) of L-aspartate uptake was 9.78+/-0.7 microM and 1.17+/-0.27 pmol/mg/s in vesicles compared to 6.53+/-1.24 microM and 13.65+/-1.0 pmol/microl/s in cells. In vesicles, L-aspartate uptake was dependent on external sodium and internal potassium, and was rheogenic. In cells, L-aspartate uptake was also dependent on external sodium. Addition of unlabelled L- and D-aspartate and L-glutamate significantly inhibited L-[14C]aspartate uptake in both preparations but D-glutamate had no effect. An antibody to the aspartate transporter, EAAC-1 recognised a protein of appropriate size in both vesicles and cells. CONCLUSIONS: L-aspartate uptake in heart is mediated by a high affinity sodium-dependent transporter. This is accompanied by the expression in heart of EAAC-1. The physiological significance of this transporter with respect to aspartate utilisation in the heart is discussed.

15955724|t|EPR investigations on radiation induced chemical transformations in Pd(ClO4)2/i-PrOH/HClO4 system from 77 to 300 K.
15955724|a|The EPR studies have been carried out on gamma irradiated samples of Pd(ClO4)2 in 9 M/4M HClO4 in the presence and absence of isopropanol [i-PrOH (5%, v/v)], in the temperature range of 77-300 K. The EPR studies revealed the formation of Pd+ complex, Pd3+ complex and several radicals such as H., OH., ClO3., ClO4. and O3- on radiolysis of these systems. Reduction of Pd2+ to Pd clusters could not be observed in the absence of i-PrOH and warming of the irradiated sample finally resulted in recovery of Pd2+ complex. However, in the presence of 5% i-PrOH, strongly oxidizing radicals like OH., ClO3. and ClO4. are suppressed and (CH3)2C.OH radical was produced along with reducing species like H.. EPR spectra in these strongly reducing conditions showed formation of Pd+ complex, which on heating above 230 K, disproportionated into Pd0 and Pd2+ complex and finally lead to formation of Pd metal aggregates. Simultaneously, pulse radiolysis technique has been employed as an alternative method to verify the EPR observations.

18812342|t|Surgery for sinus of valsalva aneurysm: 27-year experience with 100 patients.
18812342|a|Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is a rare anomaly. This study was designed to assess the long-term outcome of surgical repair of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm and factors influencing the prognosis. From August 1980 to August sinus of Valsalva aneurysm repair. Ventricular septal defect (42) and aortic regurgitation (34) were the most frequent coexisting anomalies. An approach via the involved chamber was used in 60 patients, aortotomy in 5, and a combined approach in 35. Either direct (43) or patch (57) closure was used to repair the defect. Aortic valve replacement was required in 14 patients, and 8 needed valvuloplasty. Eighty patients were followed up for 15.6 +/- 3.9 years. There were 3 hospital deaths and 2 late deaths. New York Heart Association functional class improved significantly after surgery. Actuarial survival was 94% at 10 years, and 90% at 15 years. Surgical treatment of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is safe and effective, but late progressive aortic regurgitation is still a risk during long-term follow-up, and early aggressive measures are recommended.

877290|a|366 patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the oropharynx treated by external irradiation were studied to see whether residual disease at the end of treatment influences control. The frequency of recurrence was found to be significantly greater when residual disease was present. When the total dose was determined by the degree of regression of the primary lesion during treatment rather than the initial tumor volume, recurrence was significantly more frequent. Forcing the dose beyond a level suitable for the original volume of disease failed to prevent recurrence in patients with residual disease, most likely due to the hypoxic state of the remaining tumor cells.

9824959|t|The psychiatric review of symptoms: a screening tool for family physicians.
9824959|a|The psychiatric review of symptoms is a useful screening tool for identifying patients who have psychiatric disorders. The approach begins with a mnemonic encompassing the major psychiatric disorders: depression, personality disorders, substance abuse disorders, anxiety disorders, somatization disorder, eating disorders, cognitive disorders and psychotic disorders. For each category, an initial screening question is used, with a positive response leading to more detailed diagnostic questions. Useful interviewing techniques include transitioning from one subject to another rather than abruptly changing subjects, normalization (phrasing a question to convey to the patient that such behavior is normal or understandable) and symptom assumption (phrasing a question to imply that it is assumed the patient has engaged in such behavior). The psychiatric review of symptoms is both rapid and thorough, and can be readily incorporated into the standard history and physical examination.

6849542|t|Effect of intermittent high dose parenteral corticosteroids on the alveolitis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
6849542|a|Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal disorder in which chronic accumulation of neutrophils within the alveolar structures occurs. These cells with their large stores of preformed mediators likely play a major role in subsequent lung derangement. To evaluate the adjunctive use of intermittent high dose "pulse" corticosteroid therapy as a means of inhibiting neutrophil accumulation in the IPF lung, 5 patients were treated in a single blind random fashion with "high dose" corticosteroids (2 g methylprednisolone given intravenously once a week plus 0.25 mg/kg prednisone given orally daily) and 8 patients were treated with "low dose" corticosteroids only (0.25 mg/kg prednisone given orally daily). All patients had biopsy-proved disease in midcourse, and the 2 groups were matched for clinical and physiologic criteria. To evaluate the effect of these therapies on the quantity of neutrophils in the lungs of these patients, both groups underwent bronchoalveolar lavage and 67Ga scanning at the beginning and end of the 6-month study period; both methods gave an estimate of the intensity of the neutrophil alveolitis in these patients. Low dose corticosteroids had little effect on neutrophil accumulation (% neutrophils in lavage, - 5 +/- 8% change from baseline; 67Ga uptake, + 27 +/- 14% change from baseline), whereas high dose corticosteroids significantly reduced neutrophil accumulation (% neutrophils in lavage, - 46 +/- 8% change from baseline, p less than 0.02 compared with that in the low dose group; 67 Ga uptake, - 23 +/- 11% change from baseline, p less than 0.05 compared with that in the low dose group). In addition, 2 patients in the high dose group were reevaluated 6 months after cessation of the intermittent high dose pulse corticosteroids. Both had marked increases in lavage neutrophils compared with when they were receiving the high dose therapy (10 to 22% and 18 to 52%, respectively). These findings suggest that massive doses of intermittent intravenously administered corticosteroids may help to suppress the neutrophil component of the alveolitis of IPF.

8212385|t|[Treatment of accidents occurring in a municipality in general practice and emergency clinics]
8212385|a|In one Danish municipality inhabited by 9433 persons, 9119 were registered in the health security system as group 1-secured (i.e. full public health coverage). Fifteen general practitioners in seven practices participated in a one year-project by registering accidents where the general practitioner was the primary treatment contact. These general practitioners were allocated 84.5% of the group 1-secured persons in the municipality. The general practitioners were the primary contact persons in 466 accidents. The one year contact incidence rate was 61 per 1000 secured persons. During the same period the total number of inhabitants of the municipality made 1006 contacts to the local emergency rooms as a direct consequence of accidents. The one year rate of contact incidence for emergency rooms was 107 per 1000 inhabitants. The total rate of contact incidences to medical practitioners in the local health system is calculated to be 166 per 1000 inhabitants. The general practitioners saw more children and more accidents that had taken place in schools and day care-centres. Injuries caused by acute muscular overtraining led more frequently to contact with general practice. Fewer fractures and open wounds due to accidents were registered in general practice than in the emergency room. During the daytime working hours, the general practitioner was contacted more frequently than the emergency room.

6426698|t|Adrenal medullary implants in the dopamine-denervated rat striatum. I. Acute catecholamine levels in grafts and host caudate as determined by HPLC-electrochemistry and fluorescence histochemical image analysis.
6426698|a|Rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced degeneration of the left nigrostriatal dopamine system were given intrastriatal implants of one cortex-free adrenal medulla divided into 4 pieces. Two pieces were placed in the center of the anterior part of the denervated caudate and two pieces in a more posterior position in lateral caudate. The distribution of catecholamines (CA) in grafts and host brain was studied 2, 100 and 400 min after grafting by HPLC-electrochemistry and Falck-Hillarp fluorescence histochemistry combined with computer-aided image analysis. Two minutes after implantation the chromaffin tissue grafts contained large amounts of adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) and small amounts of dopamine (DA). The chromaffin cells had a relatively normal fluorescence histochemical appearance. From the grafts, CA had spread into the surrounding host brain tissue where high levels of A and NA and low levels of DA were now found in the denervated host striatum. Fluorescence histochemistry and image analysis showed the CA to have spread 1-1.5 mm in all directions from the grafts. The CA concentrations decreased almost linearly with increasing distance from the grafts. At 100 min after implantation approximately a third of the chromaffin cells were still strongly fluorescent while the rest of the cells were very weakly fluorescent or non-fluorescent. The amounts of A, NA and DA in the host brain had decreased considerably, while the size of the fluorescent halo around the grafts had not diminished. At 400 min after grafting, only scattered cells in the chromaffin implants were strongly fluorescent and the surrounding host striatum contained low amounts of CA. It is concluded that intrastriatal adrenal medullary implants acutely release or leak large amounts of CA into surrounding host brain tissue. Taken together with results from the accompanying paper these data show that the grafts can maintain CA levels in host striatum high enough to elicit strong rotational responses during approximately 200 min.

3657924|t|Output of bacterial metabolites as a diagnostic means.
3657924|a|Output of bacterial metabolites reflects not only the number but the metabolic activity of certain microorganisms. In case of excess of a substrate one can observe the increased output of metabolite(s) without the overgrowth of intestinal bacteria. This matter is used for detection of malabsorption of some carbohydrates (lactose, glucose) by increased excretion of hydrogen in expired air. Another group of so-called breath tests (14C-cholylglycine, 14C-xylose) is designed to detect the bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine by measuring the rise of the concentration of 14CO2 in alveolar air. All the tests basing on the decomposition of the test substance by intestinal bacteria, have some limitations. Little is known about the microorganisms decomposing the different test substances. Significant correlations between the urinary phenols (p-cresol, phenol) and certain groups of mucosal flora (staphylococci, bacteroides) of the small intestine of rats could be found. Therefore one suggests that elucidating the origin of a bacterial metabolite is still possible in some instances, although very complicated. In conclusion, the authors refer to several reasons for failure to obtain correlations between the output of the metabolite(s) and data of bacteriological investigation.

17301558|t|Investigating the utility of the HIV-1 BED capture enzyme immunoassay using cross-sectional and longitudinal seroconverter specimens from Africa.
17301558|a|BACKGROUND: The identification of populations at risk of HIV infection is a priority for trials of preventive technologies, including HIV vaccines. To quantify incidence traditionally requires laborious and expensive prospective studies. METHODS: The BED IgG-Capture enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was developed to estimate HIV-1 incidence using cross-sectional data by measuring increasing levels of HIV-specific IgG as a proportion of total IgG. To evaluate this assay, we tested 189 seroconversion samples taken at 3-monthly intervals from 15 Rwandan and 26 Zambian volunteers with known time of infection and cross-sectional specimens from 617 Kenyan and Ugandan volunteers with prevalent infection. RESULTS: The BED-EIA-estimated incidence in Uganda was unexpectedly high, at 6.1%/year [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.2-8.0] in Masaka and 6.0%/year (95% CI 4.3-7.7) in Kakira. Prospective incidence data in Masaka from the same population was 1.7%/year before and 1.4%/year after the study. Kenyan estimates were 3.5%/year in Kilifi (95% CI 2.1-4.9) and 3.4%/year in Nairobi (95% CI 1.5-5.3). From the Rwandan and Zambian data, the sensitivity of the assay was 81.2% and the specificity was 67.8%. After approximately one year, subjects misclassified as recently infected tended to have lower plasma viral loads compared with those not misclassified as recent (median copies/ml 14 773 versus 93 560; P = 0.02). Clinical presentation, sex and HIV subtype were not significantly associated with BED-EIA misclassification in seroconverter samples. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that this assay does not perform reliably in all populations. Further research is warranted before using this assay to estimate incidence from prevalent HIV samples.

9516923|t|Phase II trial of topotecan administered as 72-hour continuous infusion in children with refractory solid tumors: a collaborative Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, and Children's Cancer Group Study.
9516923|a|The antitumor activity of topotecan administered as a 72-h continuous i.v. infusion was evaluated in children with refractory neuroblastoma and sarcomas of soft tissue and bone. We also attempted to increase the dose intensity of topotecan by including an intrapatient dose escalation in the trial design. Ninety-three children (85 eligible and evaluable for response) with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, or other soft-tissue sarcomas received topotecan administered as a 72-h i.v. infusion every 21 days. The initial dose was 1.0 mg/m2/day, with subsequent intrapatient dose escalation to 1.3 mg/m2/day for those patients who did not experience dose-limiting toxicity after their first cycle of topotecan. There was one complete response in a patient with neuroblastoma (n = 26) and one partial response in a patient with Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor (n = 25). No complete or partial responses were observed in 17 patients with osteosarcoma, 15 patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, or 2 patients with other soft-tissue sarcomas; however, 8 patients had prolonged (15-48 weeks) stable disease while receiving topotecan. Topotecan was well tolerated. The most commonly observed toxicities were myelosuppression (dose-limiting) and nausea and vomiting. Intrapatient dose escalations were performed in 68% of the patients who received more than one cycle of topotecan, and 1.3 mg/m2/day was tolerated by 79% of the patients who received the higher dose and were evaluable for hematological toxicity. In conclusion, topotecan administered as a 72-h continuous infusion every 21 days is inactive (objective response rate, < 20%) in children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma and sarcomas of soft tissue or bone.

9883411|t|Complete uterine septum with cervical duplication, longitudinal vaginal septum and duplication of a renal collecting system. A case report.
9883411|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of congenital uterine anomalies in the general population is estimated at 0.001-10%. Mullerian defects are associated with an increased incidence of urinary anomalies, an increased risk of infertility, early pregnancy loss, premature rupture of membranes, preterm labor and malpresentation. CASE: A 34-year-old, infertile woman with a presumed diagnosis of uterine didelphys and a longitudinal vaginal septum was noted to have a thin, communicating membrane separating the uterine horns on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A communication between these two horns was noted on hysterosalpingography (HSG). The diagnosis of complete uterine septum was therefore established. Uterine leiomyomata and a complete duplication of the right renal collecting system were also noted. CONCLUSION: Cases of complete uterine and vaginal septum can be easily confused with uterine didelphys. Management of these two mullerian anomalies is different, with surgical correction usually needed in cases of complete uterine septum. The use of pelvic ultrasound, MRI and HSG aided in correctly diagnosing this unusual form of mullerian anomaly.

7044960|t|Sites of autoantibody production in rats with thyroiditis.
7044960|a|We have developed a thyroglobulin-specific haemolytic plaque assay and investigated potential sites of autoantibody synthesis in good and poor responder strains of rats immunized with thyroglobulin and in rats subjected to thymectomy and sub-lethal irradiation which subsequently develop thyroiditis spontaneously. The bone marrow appears to be the most important site of thyroglobulin antibody synthesis in all groups, but spleen and cervical lymph nodes are also involved. No thyroglobulin plaque-forming cells could be found in the thyroid. These results imply widespread involvement of the humoral immune system in organ-specific autoimmune processes.

6685323|t|Attraction of gerbil pups to maternal nest odors: duration, specificity and ovarian control.
6685323|a|Gerbil pups are attracted to the odors of their maternal nest. This attraction develops by three weeks and is still strong at six weeks, but ceases by nine weeks of age. Removing either the mother's scent gland or her ovaries, a procedure that decreases scent gland size, decreases pup attraction to maternal nest odors. These data suggest that the mother's scent gland is the primary, though not the sole, source of the maternal nest attractants and that ovarian steroids stimulate attractant production. The gradual decline in pup attraction to maternal nest odors with age also parallels the decrease in maternal scent gland size. Pup attraction to nest odors becomes more specific as pups mature. Based on pup responses to odors of other mothers and their young, we suggest that nursing pups approach a species-typical pheromone produced by all lactating females, but that weaning pups imprint on scent gland odors specific to their mother. Other maternal odors and/or odors produced by the pups may also make the nest attractive to the young.

11458497|t|Role of the microenvironment of the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros region in hematopoiesis.
11458497|a|Although various cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines are known to regulate hematopoiesis, expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro with the use of such agents has proved problematic. Stromal cells are major components of the microenvironment that surrounds hematopoietic cells and are thought to play an important role in hematopoiesis in vivo. Co-culture of HSCs with stromal cells promotes hematopoiesis and self-renewal of HSCs. Definitive hematopoietic cells first appear during mammalian embryonic development in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, and it is therefore thought that the microenvironment of this region plays an important role in HSC ontogeny. We have adopted two approaches to studying the contribution of the AGM microenvironment to hematopoiesis. In the first approach, we have developed an in vitro culture system for mouse AGM explants. Hematopoiesis is enhanced in such cultures by the presence of the combination of stem cell factor (SCF), basic fibroblast growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M (SFLO culture). However, transplantation assays revealed that HSCs capable of long-term reconstitution of the hematopoietic compartment of irradiated mice (LTR-HSCs) do not expand in AGM-SFLO cultures; rather, these cultures appear to provide a favorable microenvironment for hematogenic angioblasts that are precursors of both endothelial and hematopoietic cells. In our second approach, we have established various stromal cell lines from the mouse AGM region. The AGM-S3 cell line supports human and mouse primitive hematopoietic cells as well as mouse LTR-HSCs. Maintenance of LTR-HSCs is mediated by a mechanism other than SCF signaling through its receptor (c-Kit). These two in vitro approaches should prove useful for further elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie hematopoiesis and HSC self-renewal.

7125683|t|Natural history of egg hypersensitivity.
7125683|a|Twenty-five children with clinical egg hypersensitivity, confirmed by double-blind challenge, were followed for between 2 and 2 1/2 years. Clinical egg hypersensitivity was fund to have resolved in 11 children but was persistent in 14. Skin prick tests reactions to egg were initially of equivalent size in the resolved and persistent groups, but became negative or diminished in size with resolution of clinical egg hypersensitivity, while remaining positive in the group with persisting symptoms. Symptoms after egg ingestion were categorised as cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and angioedema. The adverse reactions of the resolved group were either cutaneous or gastrointestinal symptoms. The persisting group had multisystem involvement and most of them developed angioedema and respiratory symptoms. These differences may be useful as prognostic indicators in clinical egg hypersensitivity.

1758975|t|Neuromedin-N inhibits migrating myoelectric complex and induces irregular spiking in the small intestine of rats; comparison with neurotensin.
1758975|a|The effects of neuromedin-N on migrating myoelectric complexes in the small intestine of rats were studied. As neuromedin-N and neurotensin are structurally related peptides a comparison with neurotensin was made. Myoelectric activity was recorded by means of three bipolar electrodes implanted into the wall of the small intestine at 5, 15 and 25 cm distal to the pylorus. The peptides were administered as intravenous infusions to fasted conscious rats. Neuromedin-N at doses of 100-800 pmol kg-1 min-1 caused a dose-dependent disruption of the migrating myoelectric complexes and induced irregular spiking activity (n = 7, P less than 0.05). Neurotensin induced a similar response, but at doses of 1.0-8.0 pmol kg-1 min-1 (n = 5, P less than 0.05). Thus, on a molar basis, neuromedin-N appeared to be about 100-times less potent than neurotensin. Hexamethonium (20 mg kg-1 i.v.) inhibited the migrating motor complexes and induced quiescence, but did not block the effect of neuromedin-N at a dose of 800 pmol kg-1 min-1. Atropine (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) and mepyramine (2 mg kg-1 i.v.) did not affect the migrating motor complexes, nor did they block the effect of neuromedin-N. Simultaneous infusion of neuromedin-N and neurotensin in a 1:1 molar ratio at doses of 2 pmol kg-1 min-1 showed inhibition of the response to neurotensin in eight out of ten experiments. In conclusion, neuromedin-N changes the myoelectric activity in the small intestine from a fasting to a fed pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

7556247|t|Preoperative CT and MR imaging of inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma.
7556247|a|We investigated the radiological findings of five patients with primary leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava (IVC) comparing cavography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The radiographic presentation ranged from an intraluminal lesion with obstruction of the IVC to a tumor mass extending from the media musculature into the surrounding perivascular tissue with only slight protrusion into the lumen. The lesions were associated with late or few symptoms. Pathognomonic radiological findings could not be established. In cases with an extraluminal growth a lobulated, well-defined, encapsulated tumor with an inhomogeneous contrast uptake is characteristic in CT studies. Additional information was provided by MRI. Leiomyosarcomas with extraluminal involvement showed homogeneous intermediate signal intensity (SI) on T1-, and mixed intermediate/high SI on T2-weighted images. In cases with predominantly intraluminal growth, both CT and MRI demonstrated the IVC to be dilatated and allowed to differentiate between tumor extent and obliterating thrombosis. Modern imaging modalities allow an early and accurate pre-operative diagnosis resulting in a higher rate of surgical resection and improvement of survival.

3799979|t|Lymph vessels of the heart. A comparative study of various techniques for light and electron microscopy.
3799979|a|This investigation was carried out in order to find out which was the best technique, among those reported in the literature, to recognize the small lymph vessels by light microscopy, while at the same time allowing a good ultrastructural preservation of tissues. The study was performed with rabbit hearts according to the following methods: (1) injection of India ink into the wall of the heart followed by perfusion with aldehyde fixative; (2) injection of India ink into the wall of the heart followed by immersion in aldehyde fixative; (3) treatment of the animals with histamine dihydrochloride by e.v. route and aldehyde (4) fixation by immersion; (5) fixation by immersion in osmium tetroxide fixative; fixation by immersion in aldehyde fixative; (6) fixation by perfusion with the same mixture as in (5). In cases (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6), the tissue specimens were postfixed in osmium tetroxide according to conventional methods. The validity of the different methods was checked by examining semithin sections of varying thickness at the light microscope and ultrathin sections at the transmission electron microscope. A comparative examination of the preparation showed that the method allowing the promptest recognition of the small lymph vessels, together with the best ultrastructural preservation and a good reproducibility of results was perfusion of the coronary circle.

8315219|t|Long-term caloric restriction improves baroreflex sensitivity in aging Fischer 344 rats.
8315219|a|The effects of aging and caloric restriction on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and baroreflex sensitivity were determined in young (7-9 months) and old (22-24 months) awake, male Fischer 344 rats which had been either ad libitum fed or calorie restricted (60% of the ad libitum calories). The MAP of young rats was higher than that of old rats. The MAP of old ad libitum fed rats was higher than that of old restricted rats with no effect of diet in young rats. The HR of restricted rats was lower than ad libitum fed rats with no significant age effect. Reflex bradycardia to hypertensive episodes was greater in restricted than in ad libitum fed rats. Reflex tachycardia to hypotensive episodes was greater in young than in old rats and greater in calorie restricted than in ad libitum fed rats. These findings demonstrate that caloric restriction alters the age-associated decline in several hemodynamic parameters.

The thyroidea ima artery arose from the aortic arch between the branchiocephalic trunk and the left common carotid artery. The thyroidea ima passed to the left lobe and isthmus of the thyroid gland for the supply of these. The inferior thyroid artery on the right side was of common type in its origin and course, though that on the left side was absent.

6477600|t|Light scattering stopped-flow studies on the time course of shape changes induced in human erythrocytes by several amphiphilic lipids.
6477600|a|The light scattering stopped-flow method was used to study the time course of shape changes in human erythrocytes induced by two series of lipids (saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) species, both with various acyl chain lengths (C12-C18] at pH 7.4 and 23 degrees C. The decrease in the scattered light intensity as a function of time suggested that these lipids induce crenation of erythrocytes, the rate constant of which is largely dependent on the nature of the respective lipids. For both series of lipids, an increase in chain length was found to decrease the rate of the induction of shape changes. The results were discussed in relation to hydrophobicity of lipid molecules.

18569180|t|Use of M-CHAT for a multinational screening of young children with autism in the Arab countries.
18569180|a|There has been a decline in the mortality rate among infants and children under five years of age in the last decade in many developing countries. This has led to a shift in focus to look beyond survival to the prevention or reduction of impairment and promotion of children's health. With the apparent rise in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the Arab countries the development of an Arabic tool for early diagnosis and intervention was sought as part of an effort to better understand the prevalence of this disorder. The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) was chosen. The study was conducted in nine Arabic speaking countries. The final analysis included 228 children (122 screened positive for ASD). The sensitivity (0.86), the specificity (0.80) and positive predictive value (0.88) were very similar to Robins et al. study (2001). Maternal health problems during pregnancy and labour were found to be more significant for ASD mothers than their control. In addition, child health problems were more evident among ASD subjects as reported by their parents with significant differences from controls. The limitation of the study is that the sample size is not large enough to generalize the results to all countries of the region. The strength of the study is that it is the first known study where Arab countries undertook a collaborative mental health study using the same tool for screening for a specific disorder.

3991550|t|Follow-up prednisolone dosage in rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis successfully treated with pulse methylprednisolone or plasma exchange.
3991550|a|Of nineteen patients with RPCGN who responded promptly to initial treatment with PMP or PX, and who were subsequently maintained on oral immunosuppression with prednisolone (reducing dosage from 30mg/day) and azathioprine/cyclophosphamide (1-3 mg/kg/day), five showed progressive loss of renal function within one year of responding to treatment. Both the daily dose at four weeks and the cumulative dose of prednisolone at six months were significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in the group whose renal function deteriorated. We suggest that the follow-up dosage of prednisolone may be critical in maintaining continued stable renal function in the first few months after starting PMP or PX.

9563666|t|The effects of age on survival and other parameters in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx.
9563666|a|Many papers have been written on the effect of age on survival from cancer and a number of these papers have concentrated on cancer of the head and neck. The literature is fairly evenly split between those studies that claim that the young patient has a better chance of survival and those that suggest the older patient has a better chance of survival. The present study investigates 2647 patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx. The tumour-specific 5-year survival of patients with head and neck cancer from the third decade through to the seventh decade at presentation was 54%, whereas this figure dropped to 44% for the eighth, ninth and tenth decades. This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0001). When the patients in the third to seventh decades of presentation were compared with those from the eighth to tenth decades, it was found that older patients tended to have significantly more advanced disease at the primary site and fewer neck node metastases when compared with younger patients at presentation. These differences were confirmed by multiple logistic regression. Multivariate analysis of survival confirmed that advanced age was associated with poor survival (P = 0.0001). Whilst patients with head and neck cancer in their eighth, ninth and tenth decades fared worse than younger patients, their mean tumour specific survival at 5 years was in the region of 44%, which makes treatment worthwhile, certainly in selected cases.

10702181|t|Nutritional and metabolic effects of the endotoxin bacterial lipopolysaccharide in orally and parenterally fed rats.
10702181|a|BACKGROUND: Animals treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) developed severe metabolic abnormalities despite receiving sufficient protein and energy by total parenteral nutrition (TPN). OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the nutritional and metabolic effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. DESIGN: Rats were randomly allocated to 5 groups: oral nutrition (ON control; n = 7), TPN control (n = 7), ON+LPS (n = 6), TPN+LPS (n = 9), and pair fed (PF) in relation to ON+LPS (n = 6). RESULTS: Body weight decreased significantly as diet consumption decreased in the ON+LPS and PF groups compared with the ON control group. Relative carcass weights were significantly lower in the TPN+LPS and ON+LPS groups than in their respective control groups. Diaphragm and extensor digitorum longus weights were significantly lower in the ON+LPS and PF rats, but not in the TPN+LPS rats, compared with their respective controls. Biochemical abnormalities and plasma corticosterone concentrations were greater in the TPN+LPS group than in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that provision of sufficient protein and energy by TPN does not prevent general carcass wasting induced by LPS but may protect individual muscles. However, compared with an oral ad libitum diet, TPN providing sufficient protein and energy worsens the biochemical abnormalities induced by LPS. More rapid clearance of TNF-alpha and low corticosterone concentrations in weight-losing animals may help reduce the severity of the metabolic effects of LPS.

3415237|a|Investigations of nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections associated with various environmental sources have been hampered by the lack of adequate techniques for selective isolation of these organisms from environmental fluids. This study compared chemical dosing techniques for recovery of NTM from water samples collected from 115 randomly selected dialysis centers. Cell suspensions of NTM group II and IV isolates and gram-negative bacteria were exposed to solutions containing sodium hypochlorite (0.2 micrograms/ml of free available chlorine), formaldehyde (1, 0.75, or 0.5%), oxalic acid (1.25%), cetylpyridinium chloride (25 micrograms/ml), or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (100 micrograms/ml). Results of standard membrane filtration assays with laboratory test strains and water samples from dialysis centers showed that 5 min of exposure to 1% formaldehyde effectively reduced gram-negative bacterial populations and allowed increased recovery of NTM in environmental fluids containing mixed microbial populations.

9801924|t|Signalling by proteolysis: death receptors induce apoptosis.
9801924|a|Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a genetically regulated mechanism with a central role in both metazoan development and homeostasis. Death receptors (Fas, TNFR-2, DR3, and TRAIL receptors) induce apoptosis upon ligation to cognate ligands or ectopic expression. The assembly of a death-inducing signalling complex occurs in a hierarchical manner upon receptor activation. The death domain of the receptor binds to the corresponding domain of the adapter molecule FADD, which in turn recruits the zymogen form of the death protease FLICE (MACH/caspase-8). Upon approximation, FLICE "zymogens" attain a sufficient concentration to self-activate and to trigger the apoptotic pathway. For the first time, a transmembrane receptor directly engaging a protease at the signalling complex and subsequently triggering a proteolytic signalling cascade is described.

17209189|t|Efficacy of daily and weekly multiple micronutrient food-like tablets for the correction of iodine deficiency in Indonesian males aged 6-12 mo.
17209189|a|BACKGROUND: Infants are highly vulnerable to iodine deficiency, and little data exist on the effect of multiple micronutrient supplementation on their iodine status. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the efficacy of daily and weekly multiple micronutrient food-like tablets (foodLETs) on increasing iodine status among infants. DESIGN: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 133 Indonesian males aged 6-12 mo were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: a daily multiple-micronutrient foodLET providing the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI)(DMM), a weekly multiple-micronutrient foodLET providing twice the RNI (WMM), a daily 10-mg Fe foodLET (DI), or placebo. Urinary iodine (UI) concentrations were measured at baseline and at 23 wk. RESULTS: At baseline, the average UI concentration (1.37 micromol/L) was within the normal range, and 30.8% of subjects had iodine deficiency (UI < 0.79 micromol/L). At 23 wk, the DMM group had the highest increment in UI; however, after adjustment for initial UI, the changes in UI were not significantly different between the 4 groups (P = 0.39). Initial UI correlated inversely with the changes in UI (P < 0.001). The DMM group had the greatest reduction and increment in the proportion of iodine-deficient infants and in infants with iodine excess, respectively; however, no significant difference was found in these proportions (P = 0.13 and P = 0.42) between the 4 groups. CONCLUSION: Daily consumption of a multiple-micronutrient foodLET providing the RNI during infancy may be one strategy to improve iodine status.

9069739|t|Commentaries on venous leg ulcers diagnostic and treatment draft guideline.
9069739|a|A guideline on venous leg ulcer diagnosis and treatment was developed by a research team from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pa., in collaboration with an inter-disciplinary panel of wound care clinicians. Working from a consensus statement based on a literature review, the authors developed preliminary algorithms, which were reviewed by a national advisory panel. The draft guideline was prepared, and the authors now seek national peer review to address whether it is clinically relevant, useful and represents current practice. The entire diagnostic draft guideline was published in the April issue of Ostomy/Wound Management; the entire treatment draft guideline in the May issue. After peer review and pilot testing, the guideline will be modified and validated in prospective clinical trials.

17904554|t|Toxoplasma gondii: virulence of tachyzoites in serum free media at different temperatures.
17904554|a|Highly virulent Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoite multiplication was recorded on the 4th and 5th days post cultivation (dpc) in seven selected cell lines either with or without fetal calf serum (FCS) in the maintenance media. The multiplication rate was slightly lower in the absence of FCS. The cell line mono-layers collapsed dying by the 6th day of infection both in presence or absence of FCS at 37 degrees C. Carcinoma of human larynx (Hep2) and Madian Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cell lines were the most suitable for in vitro multiplication, followed by that of African green monkey kidney cells (VERO), pooled kidney from 1-day-old hamster (BHK), rabbit kidney cells (RK13) and human rhabdomyosarcoma (RDA), while Chicken embryo cells (CER) were the least suitable. In absence of FCS, CER, BHK, Hep2, RDA and MDBK were able to maintain virulent tachyzoites at +4 degrees C for 14 days. The infectivity of the tachyzoites was however lower, killing 40% of the inoculated mice. Tachyzoites survived at room temperature, in the dark, for 14 days in Hep2, RDA and MDBK. However, Hep2 was the only one able to keep virulent tachyzoites until 21 dpc at room temperature and at +4 degrees C. Hep2 propagated tachyzoites were still alive but with low infectivity up to 28 dpc. The cell-lines failed to support the development of tachyzoites after 7 dpc at 37 degrees C and after the 35 dpc at lower temperatures.

10823704|a|In order to elucidate the reaction mechanism of the cyclization between an ethynyl group and an imino group at the ortho-position on an aromatic ring to afford isoquinolines, reaction of 2-ethynylbenzaldehydes under various conditions was examined. It is concluded that reaction proceeds via an ionic process and the isoquinoline 4-hydrogen atom derives from the solvent. In addition, it was found that 2-ethynylbenzaldehyde O-methyloximes underwent cyclization in the presence of primary and secondary alcohols to give 3-substituted isoquinolines.

3540280|a|We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the small subunit rRNA gene expressed by bloodstream stages of the apicomplexan Plasmodium berghei. It is 2059 nucleotides long. Elements contributing to its relatively large size are all concentrated in regions known to be variable in length among eukaryotes. In a phylogenetic tree constructed from pairwise comparisons of eukaryotic small subunit rRNA sequences, the apicomplexan line branches at a rather early point in eukaryotic evolution before any multicellular kingdoms had yet appeared.

8384288|t|Genetic and molecular analysis of a three-component transposable-element system in maize.
8384288|a|Two different factors control the mutability of an unstable allele (c2-m881058Y) of the C2 gene of maize. Both an autonomous En/Spm element and an unrelated independent factor, named Mediator, are coordinately required for the excision of the insert in c2-m881058Y. According to genetic analysis, Mediator does not have the suppressor (S) function or mutator (M) function of En/Spm. Mediator has no effect on the timing or frequency of excision of En1, En-low, or various I/dSpm elements. Hence, Mediator only mediates a specific interaction between En and the insert at c2-m881058Y. Molecular analysis of c2-m881058Y has revealed a 3.3 kb, complex, En-related receptor element inserted into the second exon of the C2 gene. The ends of this element are homologous to the ends of En/Spm, but an internal 1.7 kb region shows no En/Spm homology. A great degree (11-14%) of nucleotide changes, relative to En1, occur within and between the 12 bp TNPA binding motifs. Alterations of these critical cis-determinants may account for the need for a "helper" factor for excision. This element is named Irma, for Inhibitor that requires Mediator also, and represents a unique, low copy number class of receptor element.

15162393|t|Evaluation of three new culture media for the cultivation and isolation of Leishmania parasites.
15162393|a|The aim of this study was to establish novel culture media for Leishmania parasites with a potential of obtaining high amounts of promastigotes with long-term viability, and consisting of ingredients that were available in microbiology or parasitology laboratories. Other features of these media included no requirement for blood, FCS (Fetal calf serum) or erythrocyte lysate, inexpensiveness and easiness in preparation. In addition, aspiration samples obtained from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) suspected patients were cultivated in these media. Three culture media were prepared; trypticase beef extract hemoglobine (TBH) medium, including trypticase, beef extract and yeast extract as the protein source, glucose as the carbohydrate source, FeNH4 and bovine hemoglobine; Peptone-Yeast extract medium (PY), found to be effective in our previous studies for cultuvation of on Leishmania parasites, with bovine hemoglobine (PYH) and Brain Heart medium, containing bovine hemoglobine (BKH). The number of promastigotes were the highest on day 8 and 13 in RPMI 1640 and BKH medium, respectively. In TBH and PYH, the peak level of reproduction was between day 16 and 19, and it was found to be higher in TBH medium after the day 20. The number of promastigotes were found to be close in BKH, TBH and RPMI-1640 media and lower in PYH medium. Examination of the cultivation of the aqueous lesion specimens of the 10 CL-suspected cases in media revealed reproduction in 9 flasks of RPMI-1640 containing 10% FCS, 7 TBH, 6 BKH and 4 PYH. The differences between the culture media were not found to be statistically significant. These results suggested that, three liquid culture media, assessed in this study, with no requirement for FCS or erythrocyte lysate, were effective in the reproduction of promastigotes, and could be used effectively in the patient isolation and field studies, as well.

12576032|t|Oral metastases: report of 24 cases.
12576032|a|AIM: To study patients with oral metastatic tumours for the distribution of sex and age, the oral site and histopathological type of the metastasis, the primary tumour site and length of follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients who had an oral metastasis diagnosed during the period January 1970-January 2001 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery/Oral Pathology, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, were included in this retrospective case study. RESULTS: Of 1537 patients with newly diagnosed oral cancers, 24 had metastatic tumours. There was an equal sex distribution and age at the time of diagnosis ranged from 8 to 90 years (median 60). The metastatic tumours most commonly involved the bone (18/24), the mandible being the most common (15/18). The predominant histological type was adenocarcinoma. In most patients (n = 16) the primary tumour was already known before the oral metastatic lesion appeared. The most common primary tumours were breast, lung, kidney, and prostate, in that order. Prognosis was poor (median survival 6 months, range 1-60). CONCLUSIONS: Oral metastases are rare and may present at any age in both sexes and predominantly involve bony structures, particularly the mandible. A third of oral metastases appeared to be the first indication of an occult malignant process elsewhere.

19012387|t|Spectroscopically determined force field for water dimer: physically enhanced treatment of hydrogen bonding in molecular mechanics energy functions.
19012387|a|Our ab initio transformed spectroscopically determined force field (SDFF) methodology emphasizes, in addition to accurate structure and energy performance, comparable prediction of vibrational properties in order to improve reproduction of interaction forces. It is now applied to the determination of a molecular mechanics (MM) force field for the water monomer and dimer as an initial step in developing a more physically based treatment of the hydrogen bonding that not only underlies condensed-phase water but also must be important in molecular-level protein-water interactions. Essential electrical components of the SDFF for monomer water are found to be the following: an off-plane charge distribution, this distribution consisting of four off-atom charge sites in traditional lone pair (LP) but also in inverted lone pair (ILP) positions; allowance for a diffuse size to these off-atom sites; and the incorporation of charge fluxes (i.e., the change in charge with change in internal coordinate). Parametrization of such an LP/ILP model together with the SDFF analytically transformed valence force field results in essentially exact agreement with ab initio (in this case MP2/6-31++G(d,p)) structure, electrical, and vibrational properties. Although we demonstrate that the properties of this monomer electrical model together with its van der Waals and polarization interactions are transferable to the dimer, this is not sufficient in reproducing comparable dimer properties, most notably the huge increase in infrared intensity of a donor OH stretch mode. This deficiency, which can be eliminated by a large dipole-derivative-determined change in the effective charge flux of the donor hydrogen-bonded OH bond, is not accounted for by the charge flux change in this bond due to the induction effects of the acceptor electric field alone, and can only be fully removed by an added bond flux associated with the extent of overlap of the wave functions of the two molecules. We show that this overlap charge flux (OCF) emulates an actual O-H...LP-O intermolecular dipole flux, reflecting the unitary nature of the hydrogen-bonded system in the context of MM-separable molecules. The effectiveness of incorporating the OCF noncanonical character demonstrates that a distinctively QM-unique property can be substantively represented in MM energy functions.

591597|a|The authors report a new case of hepatic adenoma apparently related to oral contraception continued for more than 9 years with a pill containing mestranol. The clinical presentation suggested an attack of hepatic colic with swollen gall bladder. The preoperative diagnosis of a tumour of segment VI of the liver was made by radiological examination of neighbouring organs. Hepatic arteriography, hepatic radioisotope scan using technetium phytate and echotomography. Surgical removal of segment VI confirmed by histological study showed that it was an adenoma with multiple foci, associated with hepatic involvement. One of the tumours was the site of central included hemorrhage, responsible for the clinical syndrome. In connection with this case the authors review the possible relationship between hepatic adenoma and oral contraception.

283707|t|Effects of orthodontic intermaxillary class III mechanics on craniofacial structures. Part II - computerized cephalometrics.
283707|a|The relation between active growth and induced anatomic changes was examined using a computerized cephalometric analysis of ten Class III cases treated with intermaxillary traction. The following can be concluded from this investigation: 1. Mandibular growth was redirected and mandibular opening was observed due to maxillary molar extrusion and counterclockwise rotation of the maxilla. 2. Condylar repositioning was noted to occur in all cases due to the effect of the external pterygoid muscle and a possible translatory movement during mandibular rotation. 3. Counterclockwise palatal development occurred in most of the treated cases through vertical action of the Class III mechanism. 4. The effect of the Class III traction was also observed in the mandibular incisor and molar teeth. The incisors retruded and the molars either were located in the predicted position or farther distally. 5. The soft tissue profile was less concave than the predicted value due to less mandibular growth and more retruded incisors in the treated cases. 6. Evidence was shown that a positive relationship exists between computerized cephalometrics and photoelastic techniques in the analysis of ten treated cases. This relationship is based on the fact that specific changes which took place during treatment were found to be consistent with the results of the photoelastic analysis.

2047157|a|A series of nine infants, 2-8 months of age, with a history of animal or vegetable fat intake within 10 days after birth, is presented. The infants developed respiratory problems and failure to thrive. Plain films and computed tomography showed areas of consolidation in the medial-posterior parts of the lungs. The areas of consolidation showed three types of changes at computed tomography. Attenuation measurements did not reveal fat. To establish the diagnosis, fine needle aspiration biopsy, tru-cut biopsy and/or open lung biopsy was done in eight infants and bronchopulmonary lavage in one patient. The pathological findings were an intense lymphocytic infiltration with scattered granulomas which contained lipid deposit.

Mice injected with lipopolysaccharide and then X-rayed did not demonstrate the tolerant state. An injection of thorium dioxide in mice that had previously received tolerance-inducing amounts of lipopolysaccharide rendered them as susceptible to acute C. albicans toxicity as control mice. A bimodal manifestation of tolerance was noted. Groups of mice given single injections of lipopolysaccharide at 6 or 1 days before challenge demonstrated high levels of tolerance, whereas the tolerance in mice given a single dose at 3 days was negligible. The bimodal effect was not observed in tolerant mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide. Injections of viable or nonviable pathogenic fungi known to produce tolerance to the toxicity of C. albicans in recipient mice did not produce tolerance to lipopolysaccharide. Serum from mice injected with lipopolysaccharide showed in vitro inhibitory activity for C. albicans.

WISC-III and Visual Motor Integration-3R scores from 99 boys and 46 girls ranging in age from 6 to 16 years were obtained by certified school psychologists to study the relationship between the two measures. Participants were drawn from six suburban Chicago school districts, two being very affluent. These Pearson correlations for standard scores ranging from .34 to .57 and following previous research, were ranked from highest to lowest and then transformed into an approximately normal Z statistic using Fisher Z. The highest correlation was compared to the next highest and so on, which yielded significant differences. Only four comparisons had to be made.

12559135|t|Correlation of mental health problems with psychological constructs in adolescence: final results from a 2-year study.
12559135|a|In recent years, it has been widely witnessed that a surprising number of adolescents suffer emotional and mental health problems, and such turmoil is very often carried over into adulthood with serious implications for adjustment during the post-adolescent years. On this point, mental health problems in Korea are only now being considered crucial factors in the health status of adolescents and important public and social issues. It is also true that studies concerning the link between adolescents' mental health problems and their psychology are limited. The purposes of this study were to investigate mental health problems of Korean adolescents, to reveal factors affecting their negative mental health and to explore a possible relationship between mental health problems and psychological variables. 2052 Korean adolescents selected randomly from junior high and high schools in Seoul, Korea were surveyed. Korean Symptom Checklist, Health Locus of Control Scale, Self-efficacy Scale and Self-esteem Scale were used to identify mental health problems and psychological variables of adolescents. Results indicated that Korean adolescents showed high prevalence in interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety and hostility. In addition, the findings revealed that there were significant differences in adolescents' mental health problems between gender and age. Furthermore, results revealed that the adolescents' mental health problems were statistically correlated with psychological variables. This study provides significant information for the relatively unstudied Korean adolescents and also has the potential to influence the development of better mental health programs for adolescents.

18571329|t|Clinical efficacy assessment of the albendazole-ivermectin combination in lambs parasitized with resistant nematodes.
18571329|a|Combination of anthelmintic drugs from different chemical groups has been proposed as alternative parasite control strategies where failure of individual drugs is documented. The main goal of the current trial was to compare the clinical anthelmintic efficacy of albendazole (ABZ) and ivermectin (IVM) given either separately or co-administered to lambs naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes resistant to both molecules. Seventy (70) Corriedale lambs naturally infected with multiple resistant gastrointestinal nematodes were involved in the efficacy trial: the animals were allocated into 7 experimental groups (n=10) and treated with either ABZ intravenously (iv) (ABZ(IV)), IVM(IV), ABZ(IV)+IVM(IV), ABZ intraruminally (ir) (ABZ(IR)), IVM subcutaneously (sc) (IVM(SC)) and ABZ(IR)+IVM(SC) or kept as untreated controls. The indirect estimation of the efficacy of the different treatments was performed by the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). Additionally, four animals randomly chosen from the untreated control and ABZ(IV,) IVM(IV) and ABZ(IV)+IVM(IV) experimental groups were sacrificed 15 days post-treatment to evaluate the efficacy against different adult resistant nematode parasites. The results were statistically compared by a non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis test). The following egg output reduction values were obtained: 73.4% (ABZ(IV)), 79.0% (IVM(IV)), 91.9% (ABZ(IV)+IVM(IV)), 43.5% (ABZ(IR)), 79.8% (IVM(SC)) and 70.8% (ABZ(IR)+IVM(SC)). The efficacy against Haemonchus spp. was 95.1 (ABZ(IV)), 99.3 (IVM(IV)) and 99.9% (ABZ(IV)+IVM(IV)), while the efficacy against Trichostrongylus colubriformis for the same treatment groups was 79.6, 100 and 99.9%. The data obtained on the assessment of the ABZ-IVM combination indicates that no potentiation synergism is observed. This work is complementary to a parallel study that demonstrated the lack of negative pharmacokinetic interactions between the two anthelmintics acting by different mode of action. Thus, an additive effect may be achieved against nematodes resistant to both compounds. Further work is required to understand the implications of potential pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interactions between anthelmintics before drug combined formulations are developed to be introduced into the pharmaceutical market.

6512993|t|Functional cardiac depression caused by defibrillator shocks. Quantitation of the safety factor for electrical defibrillation.
6512993|a|The overdose shock strengths required to depress ventricular contraction were determined for damped sinusoidal current in 7 metabolically supported, isolated contracting canine hearts. Each heart was suspended in an isoresistive and isotonic solution-through which the defibrillating shocks were delivered. Defibrillation thresholds were determined with standard damped sine wave shocks of 4.4-5.5 msec duration. Then overdose shocks were delivered and the depressant effect on systolic left ventricular pressure was measured for shocks of 3-12 times threshold current. The minimum (threshold) current and energy densities required to defibrillate were 59.5 +/- 4.6 mA/cm2 (average) and 3.12 +/- 0.2 mJ/cm3. Increasing the shock strength above threshold produced a concomitant reduction of postshock left ventricular systolic pressure. The current and energy densities required to produce 50% depression (TD50) of left ventricular systolic pressure were 5.0 and 24.1 times the threshold current and energy densities respectively, indicating a wide safety margin using this criterion.

2358015|t|Antigenic phenotyping of human follicular dendritic cells isolated from nonmalignant and malignant lymphatic tissue.
2358015|a|Follicular dendritic cells (FDC) are located within follicles of secondary lymphoid tissue and in lymph nodes of patients with germinal center cell-derived non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Reliable antigenic phenotyping of FDC within tissue sections has been difficult due to simultaneous labeling of the surrounding germinal center cells. Using an enzyme cocktail to digest human tonsils and cervical lymph nodes with subsequent fractionation by albumin gradient centrifugation, cell isolates containing up to 20% FDC were obtained. This preparation allowed the determination of antigenic phenotype on individual FDC. Molecules expressed by FDC were detected by an isotype-specific immunocytochemical double-labeling procedure, i.e. a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for FDC (KiM4 or DRC1) in conjunction with a mAb reactive against an additional antigenic determinant. Nonspecific binding of mAb to immunoglobulin Fc receptors located on FDC membranes was avoided by incubation of cells with human IgG aggregates prior to immunostaining. The results revealed that isolated FDC from these lymphoid tissues express transferrin receptors, the intercellular adhesion molecule 1, class II antigens, the B cell antigens CD20 and CD21, and the myelomonocytic properties CD11b and CD14. Immunoglobulin mu or gamma heavy chains and the B cell antigens CD23 and CD24 are detected on 50% of an isolated FDC population. These FDC are negative for the T helper cell antigen CD4, the B cell cell antigens CD19 and CD22, the immunolobulin alpha and delta chains and the S-100 protein. FDC isolated from lymph nodes of patients with low-grade malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma, identified by DRC1 or KiM4 mAb, presented the same antigenic profile as seen on FDC from nonmalignant tissue. This suggests that FDC from lymphoma tissue isolated in this manner have the same properties as those found in normal tissue.

10652466|t|Structural features of MHC class I molecules that might facilitate alternative pathways of presentation.
10652466|a|Comparisons of the structures of different mouse MHC class I molecules define how polymorphic residues determine the unique structural motif and atomic anchoring of their bound peptides. Here, Ted Hansen and colleagues speculate that quantitative differences in how class I molecules interact with peptide, beta2-microglobulin and molecular chaperones that facilitate peptide loading might determine their relative participation in different pathways of antigen presentation.

18019565|t|Development of HPTLC-UV absorption densitometry method for the analysis of alprazolam and sertraline in combination and its application in the evaluation of marketed preparations.
18019565|a|A new simple, sensitive, and reproducible high-performance thin-layer chromatography method for the estimation of alprazolam and sertraline in combination is developed using silica gel plates with fluorescent indicators. The system is equipped with an automated sample applicator, and the detection was performed at 254 nm by using UV absorption densitometry. The mobile phase consists of carbon tetrachloride, methanol, acetone, and ammonia in the ratio 12:3:5:0.1. The retention factor values for alprazolam and sertraline are found to be 0.52 and 0.70, respectively. The limit of detection of alprazolam and sertraline in the mixture of given proportion is observed to be 0.05 microg/mL and 2.5 microg/mL and the limit of quantitation is 0.2 microg/mL and 10 microg/mL, respectively. The method has shown good linearity in the range of 0.2 microg/mL to 0.65 pg/mL for alprazolam (R2 > 0.9953) and 10 pg/mL to 32.5 microg/mL for sertraline (R2 > 0.9942). The intra- and inter-assay (n=5) variations in the linear range are less than 4% for alprazolam and 6% for sertraline. Three pharmaceutical products containing this combination are analyzed to test the applicability of the new method. The percentage of alprazolam and sertraline in the tablets studied range from 97.7% to 102.82% and 96.5% to 99.9%, respectively.

4083224|t|[Clinical evaluation of aztreonam for complicated urinary tract infection]
4083224|a|Efficacy and safety of Aztreonam, a monobactam antibiotic developed by E.R. Squibb & Sons, Inc. U.S.A., in complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) were studied. Aztreonam was administered to 15 patients with complicated UTI admitted to our Hospitals between July, 1984 and January, 1985. A two-gram dose of Aztreonam was administered twice a day intravenously or intraductally for 5 days consecutively. There were 11 evaluable cases in accordance with the UTI Drug Efficacy Evaluation Standard (the second issue). Overall clinical effect of these cases were "excellent" in 6 cases, "good" in 2 cases and "poor" in 3 cases. All the effective cases ("excellent" and "good") were of single infections and all the non-effective cases ("poor") were of complicated infections. All of the gram-negative pathogens and 4 of the 8 gram-positive pathogens were eliminated. In no cases were side effects or significantly abnormal laboratory findings reported. Therefore, Aztreonam is very effective and safe for complicated UTI, especially gram-negative infections.

11687065|t|Prophylactic caffeine to prevent postoperative apnea following general anesthesia in preterm infants.
11687065|a|BACKGROUND: Growing ex-preterm infants who undergo general anesthesia for surgery at about term-equivalent age may have episodes of apnea, cyanosis and bradycardia during the early postoperative period. A breathing stimulant such as caffeine, given at the time of operation, might prevent these episodes. OBJECTIVES: In ex-preterm infants who undergo general anesthesia for surgery, does the prophylactic use of caffeine prevent episodes of apnea, cyanosis and bradycardia during the postoperative period without clinically important side effects? SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal trials, MEDLINE (1966 - July 2001), EMBASE 1980 - July 2001), CINAHL (1982 - July 2001) and Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2001. Search terms included text 'apnea', 'caffeine' and MeSH 'infant, premature'. Searches were also made of previous reviews including cross references. Abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research were hand searched for the years 1996 - 2001 inclusive. SELECTION CRITERIA: All trials utilising random or quasi-random patient allocation, in which treatment was compared with placebo or no treatment, were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used to select trials, evaluate quality and to extract data. The methodological quality of each trial was reviewed by the second author blinded to trial authors and institution(s). Each author extracted data separately, compared and resolved differences. Meta-analysis used relative risk and risk difference. MAIN RESULTS: Three eligible trials were found. In each trial apnea/bradycardia occurred in fewer treated than control infants. The typical estimate for relative risk reduction was 91%, 95% CI 66%, 98%. Absolute risk reduction was 58%, indicating that fewer than two infants have to be treated with caffeine to expect to prevent one with postoperative apnea. In two trials continuous recordings of oxygen saturation detected hypoxaemic episodes (<90 %) in fewer treatment than control infants. No infant in any trial required intubation and mechanical ventilation. No adverse effects were reported. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Implications for practice. Caffeine can be used to prevent postoperative apnea/bradycardia and episodes of oxygen desaturation in growing preterm infants if this is deemed clinically necessary. In view of the small numbers of infants studied in these trials and uncertainty concerning the clinical significance of the episodes, caution is warranted in applying these results to routine clinical practice. Implications for research. There is a need to determine which infants might benefit most by this treatment. Studies confined to those most at risk of apnea (prior history, younger postmenstrual age) and those that might require mechanical ventilation (chronic lung disease) would be of value.

18816975|t|Using real-time visual feedback to improve posture at computer workstations.
18816975|a|The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of a multicomponent intervention that included discrimination training, real-time visual feedback, and self-monitoring on postural behavior at a computer workstation in a simulated office environment. Using a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across 8 participants, the study assessed the effects of the intervention across three postural variables. Following an information phase, the intervention started for the lowest stable postural variable. The intervention led to substantial improvements in safety behavior for most targeted postural variables. A reversal to the information phase for 2 participants did not lead to decreases in safety. Postures self-monitored with high accuracy improved to a greater degree than postures self-monitored with low accuracy.

7050059|t|Bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine in young asymptomatic smokers.
7050059|a|Methacholine inhalation challenges were performed in 10 young smokers who denied having respiratory symptoms and in 10 nonsmokers of the same age. There were five males and five females in each group. The bronchoconstriction was evaluated with specific lung conductance (sGL), maximum partial (initiated from end-inspiratory lung volume) expiratory flows assessed at 40% vital capacity breathing air (Vmax40p air), and a He-O2 mixture (Vmax40p He), and with maximum complete flows breathing He-O2 [forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1), Vmax50c He]. Dose-response curves were studied for 1) threshold concentration (TC) where values depart by more than two SD from base line; 2) provocative concentration (PC) causing a fixed fall in a parameter. Smokers differed significantly from nonsmokers for TC and PC accessed by Vmax40p He (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01, respectively), Vmax40p air (P less than 0.01), and Vmax50c He (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively). TC and PC estimated by sGL and FEV1 were not significantly different. Males and females showed a similar reaction.

17726617|t|Effects of serine protease inhibitors on viability and morphology of Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis promastigotes.
17726617|a|To investigate the importance of serine proteases in Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes, we analyzed the effects of classical serine protease inhibitors and a Kunitz-type inhibitor, obtained from sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus (ShPI-I), on the viability and morphology of parasites in culture. Classical inhibitors were selected on the basis of their ability to inhibit L. amazonensis serine proteases, previously described. The N-tosyl-L: -phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and benzamidine (Bza) inhibitors, which are potential Leishmania proteases inhibitors, in all experimental conditions reduced the parasite viability, with regard to time dependence. On the other hand, N-tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) did not significantly affect the parasite viability, as it was poor Leishmania enzymes inhibitor. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that both Bza and TPCK induced changes in the flagellar pocket region with membrane alteration, including bleb formation. However, TPCK effects were more pronounced than those of Bza in Leishmania flagellar pocket in plasma membrane, and intracellular vesicular bodies was visualized. ShPI-I proved to be a powerful inhibitor of L. amazonensis serine proteases and the parasite viability. The ultrastructural alterations caused by ShPI-I were more dramatic than those induced by the classical inhibitors. Vesiculation of the flagellar pocket membrane, the appearance of a cytoplasmic vesicle that resembles an autophagic vacuole, and alterations of promastigotes shape resulted.

1972395|t|Liver damage induced by intrabiliary turpentine in rats.
1972395|a|Inflammation of the rat bile duct induced by administration of turpentine into it has been used to study the influence of the impaired duct on liver function. Turpentine was dissolved in olive oil 1:1000 and 1:500. A 2 h ligation of the bile duct was used to promote a local effect. Contemporary groups of intact, sham-operated, control rats (given 0.9% NaCl by intrabiliary injection) and animals with total chronic obstruction were compared to assess the significance of changes. Serum concentrations of total and conjugated bilirubin, cholesterol and creatinine, activities of S-alanine-aminotransferase, S-aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, mortality of rats, and also total body weight compared with the weight of the liver, were investigated on days 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64 after surgery and turpentine, or following ligation of the bile duct. An increase in bilirubin and cholesterol, an augmentation of enzymatic activity and the histological changes were indicative of hepatotoxicity or cholestasis. The turpentine concentration--effect, manifested in body-weight change, suggests some specificity of the effect. There were no changes in serum creatinine arterial blood pressure, heart rate or portal blood pressure, when turpentine was administered by the intrabiliary route. These results suggest primary liver damage.

15165654|t|Training support persons to help smokers quit: a pilot study.
15165654|a|BACKGROUND: Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a skills-training intervention for adults interested in helping someone to stop smoking (i.e., support persons). METHODS: Sixty adult support persons (77% female) were directly recruited from the community and randomly assigned to this intervention (manual plus five weekly group-based sessions) or a control condition (one-page leaflet). All intervention and outcome assessments occurred through the support persons. Assessments occurred at weeks 0 (baseline), 6 (end of treatment), 12, and 24. The study was conducted from 1998 to 2001; data collection occurred from 1999 to 2000. Outcomes were ratings of treatment acceptability, recruitment and retention rates, supportive behaviors provided to the smoker, and smoking behavior change in the smoker as reported by the support person. RESULTS: Support persons were recruited in a timely manner and study retention rates were high. Support persons in skills training showed significant increases in their supportive behavior scores compared with control subjects at weeks 6 and 12. Although not statistically significant, the skills-training intervention was associated with more quit attempts, greater improvement in stage of change, and higher 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates in the smokers than the control condition. CONCLUSIONS: A skills training intervention for support persons is feasible and acceptable. Further studies are needed to test the efficacy of this approach for smoking cessation.

15505702|t|Canadian Standards Association standard CAN/CSA/Z264.1-02:2002: a new voluntary standard for spacers and holding chambers used with pressurized metered-dose inhalers.
15505702|a|A new Canadian standard (CAN/CSA/Z264.1-02:2002) has been published with the purpose of helping to ensure the safety, efficacy and functionality of spacers and/or holding chambers. They are prescribed for use by spontaneously breathing patients for the treatment of various respiratory diseases where medication is delivered to the lungs using pressurized-metered dose inhalers. This consensus standard was developed with the support of pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers of spacers and holding chambers, and with the help of clinicians, retail pharmacists and representatives of patient advocate bodies associated with respiratory diseases and the dissemination of information related to the treatment and the delivery of inhaled medications. Advice was also sought from expert groups outside of Canada to ensure that the standard would be relevant internationally. Whereas monographs in the pharmaceutical compendia and guidance documents published by regulatory bodies provide information that is largely about the drug product and inhaler, this is the only standard whose focus is primarily on these add-on devices. The purpose of the present review is to highlight the main features of the standard for clinicians by describing its scope, the tests that are intended to assure the robustness of the construction of these devices, the type of testing that is specified to establish in vitro efficacy, and the recommendations for the marking and labelling of the device and its associated packaging. Manufacturers who test their products to this Canadian Standards Association standard will be able to provide performance information about add-on devices to the clinician, facilitating an informed decision when selecting devices for patients.

2546857|t|IS257 from Staphylococcus aureus: member of an insertion sequence superfamily prevalent among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
2546857|a|The nucleotide sequences for the IS257 family of insertion sequences from Staphylococcus aureus were compared with those of the ISS1 family from Streptococcus lactis and the IS15 family which is widespread amongst Gram-negative bacteria. These elements have a striking degree of similarity in both their putative transposase polypeptide sequences and their nucleotide sequences (40 to 64% between pairs), including 12 out of 14 bp conservation in their terminal inverted repeats. The evolutionary distance between the IS15 family and the IS257 and ISS1 families of Gram-positive origin is approximately twice that between the IS257 and ISS1 families. Analysis of base substitutions in the three sequences has provided insights into the effect of selection for the G + C content of immigrant genes to conform to that of their hosts, and into the evolution of biases in overall amino acid composition of cellular proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The IS257, ISS1, IS15 families form a superfamily of insertion sequences that has been involved in the spread of a number of antimicrobial resistance determinants in Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.

9974187|t|Tizanidine protects mice against convulsions induced by lidocaine: involvement of alpha 2-adrenoceptors.
9974187|a|The effects of alpha-adrenoceptors agents on seizures induced by intraperitoneal administration of lidocaine (75 mg/kg) were studied in mice. Pretreatment with the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, tizanidine, decreased the incidence of seizures induced by lidocaine. Tizanidine increased the latency to the first seizure in those animals which progressed to seizures. The blockade of alpha 2-adrenoceptors with yohimbine or phentolamine counteracted the protection induced by tizanidine. The selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, did not modify the protection induced by tizanidine. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine also increased the latency to the first seizure induced by lidocaine. The protective effect of clonidine was also reversed by pretreatment with the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved in seizures induced by lidocaine.

6202881|t|Characterization of a Rous sarcoma virus mutant defective in packaging its own genomic RNA: biochemical properties of mutant TK15 and mutant-induced transformants.
6202881|a|The accompanying paper (S. Kawai and T. Koyama , J. Virol. 51:147-153, 1984) describes the isolation and biological properties of a mutant, TK15 , derived from a Rous sarcoma virus mutant, tsNY68 . The cis-acting defect of the mutant is analyzed biochemically in this paper. TK15 virions released from virus-producing 15c (+) cells were deficient in viral genomic 39S RNA, although comparable amounts of viral RNAs were transcribed in 15c (+) and tsNY68 -infected cells. Analysis of provirus DNA occurring in 15c (+) cells suggested that the mutant genome had a deletion of ca. 250 bases near the 5' end of the genome somewhere between the primer binding site and the 5' end of the gag-coding region. These findings indicate that at least part of the sequence lost in the TK15 genome is indispensable for packaging viral genomic RNA into virions. TK15 induces nonvirus -producing 15c (-) transformants at high frequency. Southern blot analysis of DNAs from those 15c (-) clone cells revealed that TK15 -derived proviruses contained various extents of internal deletions. Many 15c (-) clones had a provirus carrying only the src gene with long terminal repeat sequences at both ends. The mechanism for the segregation of 15c (-) cells is discussed.

8507782|t|Quantitative in vivo assessment of the tissue response to dermal sheep collagen in abdominal wall defects.
8507782|a|We quantified the tissue response, tissue organization and patency of biodegradable patches for the repair of abdominal wall defects. We used dermal sheep collagen, cross-linked with hexamethylenediisocyanate in a model. The collagen patches were implanted either untreated or plasma polymerized with tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), to improve the properties of the patch for bowel adhesion and rate of degradation. The implants with surrounding tissue were retrieved after 3 d, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 wk, then sectioned and stained specifically for macrophages, neutrophils, T-lymphocytes and endothelium. Only macrophages and neutrophils were observed in the implant and surrounding tissue, with different antigen expression in the macrophages. This was found to be dependent on whether the macrophages were found within the implant or in the surrounding tissue. The neutrophils and macrophages were assessed using image analysis techniques to quantify the tissue responses to treated and untreated collagen, enabling comparison of the respective tissue responses. No significant differences were found between the two forms of this collagen. Infection played a key role in the severity of the tissue response around both types of implants, resulting in large variations in cell counts at each time period. Treating the collagen with TFE did not significantly improve its performance in this application.

1801313|a|The resistance of several animals to snake venom has been reviewed. Some general concepts are introduced to allow the comparative evaluation of the resistance of different animals studied by different investigators. The purification and properties of several factors isolated from the serum of different animals by some researchers are described: Trimeresurus flavoviridis (Omori-Satoh et al., 1972); Vipera palaestinae (Ovadia et al., 1975, 1977); Sigmodon hispidus (Pichyangkul and Perez, 1981); Didelphis virginiana and Didelphis marsupialis (Menchaga and Perez, 1981; Moussatche et al., 1979, 1980, 1981; Perales et al., 1986, 1989a,b); Neotoma micropus (Garcia and Perez, 1984); Erinaceus europaeus (de Witt and Westromm, 1987); Herpestes edwardsii (Tomihara et al., 1987); Dinodon semicarinatus (Tomihara et al., 1988); and Philander opossum (Domont et al., 1989). The protective antihemorrhagic and antineurotoxic factors have some common characteristics: they are acid proteins with isoelectric points ranging between 4.0 and 5.4; their molecular masses vary from 52 to 90 kDa, with one exception of 780 kDa; none has proteolytic activity; their pH and thermostabilities are high and they seem to be glycoproteins. No precipitation lines are formed between the neutralizing proteins and the venoms upon immunodiffusion, indicating that the serum protective factors are not immunoglobulins. The possible mode of action of the antineurotoxic factor isolated from Vipera palaestinae by Ovadia et al. (1977) is shortly discussed as well as the possibility that the antihemorrhagic factors may act by a similar mechanism.

17276029|t|[Non-guideline use of innovative and expensive drugs in pediatrics: assessing clinical practice]
17276029|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze in a pediatric hospital the use of expensive drugs as part of the new activity-based system (T2A) of funding for French public hospitals. We identified and analyzed the therapeutic use of these drugs in indications not included in the expert recommendations issued to accompany this change, with the goal of proposing specific pediatric recommendations. METHOD: Analysis of prescriptions from May through September 2005 showed that 259 patients received expensive drugs subject to special reimbursement. The computerized prescription system enabled us to monitor and validate prescriptions daily. Indications for these expensive drugs were ranked by relevance. RESULTS: The prescriptions analyzed covered 26 expensive drugs. Among the 344 "patient-drugs", 80% were expensive drugs for an accepted therapeutic use, 5% for a pertinent therapeutic use (under evaluation), and 15% for "off-label" uses (2% "not approved" and 13% for indications not considered by the recommendations). CONCLUSION: This study showed that some therapeutic uses not approved by the official recommendations are nevertheless justified. Gathering data from other pediatric hospitals is essential to determine the need for pediatric clinical trials.

18327366|t|An inverse relation between CagA+ strains of Helicobacter pylori infection and risk of erosive GERD.
18327366|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is investigating the association of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and its cytotoxic-associated gene A (cagA) strain with reflux esophagitis. METHODS: In a case-control setting (May 2005-2006), patients with reflux esophagitis (case group) were compared with age and gender matched people suffering from symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease with normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopic findings (control group) in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tabriz, Iran. The rates of H. pylori and its cagA positive infections were separately compared between the 2 groups and the subgroups with different severity of reflux esophagitis. RESULTS: Ninety-two and 93 patients were enrolled in the case and the control groups. The rate of H. pylori infection was insignificantly lower in the case group (81.5% versus 87.10%, p=0.29, odd ratio 0.654, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 0.293 to 1.495). The CagA positive infections were found significantly more frequent in the control group (59.1% versus 40.2%, p=0.01, odd ratio 0.465, 95% CI 0.258 to 0.836). There was no significant difference between the severity subgroups of the disease for H. pylori (p=0.30) or cagA positive infection rates (p=0.40). CONCLUSION: The CagA positive strains might have a protective effect against reflux esophagitis.

11929910|t|Responses of spinothalamic lamina I neurons to repeated brief contact heat stimulation in the cat.
11929910|a|It was recently shown that repeated heat stimulation, using brief contacts (<1 s) with a preheated thermode at sufficiently short interstimulus intervals (ISIs <5 s) and high temperatures (> or =51 degrees C), will elicit in humans a sensation of rapidly augmenting "second" (burning) pain with only a weak "first" (sharp) pain sensation. Most strikingly, at short intertrial intervals (ITIs >5 s) such summation will reset, or begin again at baseline. In the present experiments, the responses of nociceptive lamina I spinothalamic (STT) neurons in the lumbosacral dorsal horn of barbiturate-anesthetized cats were examined using this repeated brief contact heat paradigm. The neurons were classified as nociceptive-specific (NS, n = 8) or polymodal nociceptive (HPC, n = 8) based on their responses to quantitative thermal stimuli; all had receptive fields on the glabrous ventral hindpaw. A pneumatic piston was used to apply a thermode preheated to 34, 46, 49, 53, or 58 degrees C with a contact dwell time of approximately 0.7 s to the ventral hindpaw repeatedly (15 times) at ISIs of 2, 3, and 5 s, with 3-5 min between trials. The mean responses of the 16 nociceptive lamina I STT cells showed rapid temporal summation that was directly dependent on temperature and inversely dependent on ISI, with the greatest increases occurring between the 3rd and 10th contacts. The temporal profiles of this family of curves correspond with the psychophysical data on human sensation. Further analysis showed that this summation was due to the HPC cells, which all showed strong summation; in contrast, the NS cells showed little, if any. The HPC responses to the repeated heat stimuli lagged each contact by approximately 1 s, consistent with the strong, monosynaptic C-fiber input that is characteristic of HPC cells and also with the dependence of second pain on C-fiber nociceptors. HPC cells also displayed the reset phenomenon at short ITIs, again in correspondence with the psychophysical data. The summation and the reset displayed by HPC cells were not related to skin temperature. Thus the results presented in this study, together with those in the preceding article, demonstrate a double dissociation indicating that NS and HPC lamina I STT cells can subserve the qualitatively distinct sensations of first (sharp) and second (burning) pain, respectively. These findings support the concept that the lamina I STT projection comprises several discrete sensory channels that are integrated in the forebrain to generate distinct sensations.

3589908|t|Nonthoracotomy esophagectomy for corrosive esophagitis with gastric perforation.
3589908|a|Surgical treatment of corrosive esophagitis with gastric perforation is a high risk operation. Nonthoracotomy esophagectomy plus total gastrectomy was performed upon seven patients and compared with cervical esophagostomy plus total gastrectomy performed upon five patients. Two patients in the first group and all of the patients in the second group died. Transpleural esophagectomy for these critically ill patients is usually dangerous with high morbidity rates, while nonthoracotomy esophagectomy is a procedure which has lower risks and more advantages for removing the damaged esophagus of the patient with corrosive esophagitis.

3985239|t|Does a vegetarian diet reduce the occurrence of diabetes?
3985239|a|We propose the hypothesis that a vegetarian diet reduces the risk of developing diabetes. Findings that have generated this hypothesis are from a population of 25,698 adult White Seventh-day Adventists identified in 1960. During 21 years of follow-up, the risk of diabetes as an underlying cause of death in Adventists was approximately one-half the risk for all US Whites. Within the male Adventist population, vegetarians had a substantially lower risk than non-vegetarians of diabetes as an underlying or contributing cause of death. Within both the male and female Adventist populations, the prevalence of self-reported diabetes also was lower in vegetarians than in non-vegetarians. The associations observed between diabetes and meat consumption were apparently not due to confounding by over- or under-weight, other selected dietary factors, or physical activity. All of the associations between meat consumption and diabetes were stronger in males than in females.

39532|t|A comparison between lick or lever-pressing contingent reward and the effects of neuroleptics thereon.
39532|a|Rats implanted with an electrode in the lateral hypothalamus were trained to obtain brain-stimulation by either pressing a lever or by licking a steel drinking tube in subsequent 15-min sessions. Half of the rats began the sessions with lever-pressing, the other half began with licking. After stabilization of the response rates, rats were run in saline- or drug-sessions. During the drug sessions rats were treated with 4 doses of the following neuroleptics: haloperidol, pimozide, pipamperone, azaperone. These neuroleptics dose-relatedly inhibited licking for brain-stimulation but suppressed lever-pressing only at the highest dose tested. The lick response was thus inhibited at lower doses than lever-pressing. This differential sensitivity to neuroleptics appears not to be due to a difference in baseline response rates, schedule differences or to the motor activity involved in both responses, but rather to the different thresholds of reinforcement produced by licking and lever-pressing for brain-stimulation.

15543632|t|The influence of microtextured basal lamina analog topography on keratinocyte function and epidermal organization.
15543632|a|The rational design of future bioengineered skin substitutes requires an understanding of the mechanisms by which the three-dimensional microarchitecture of tissue scaffolds modulates keratinocyte function. Microtextured basal lamina analogs were developed to investigate the relationship between the characteristic topography at the dermal-epidermal interface of native skin and keratinocyte function. Microfabrication techniques were used to create master patterns, negative replicates, and collagen membranes with ridges and channels of length scales (e.g., grooves of 50-200 microm in depth and width) similar to the invaginations found in basal lamina at the dermal-epidermal junction of native skin. Keratinocytes were seeded on the surfaces of basal lamina analogs, and histological analyses were performed after 7 days of tissue culture at the air-liquid interface. The keratinocytes formed a differentiated and stratified epidermis that conformed to the features of the microtextured membranes. Morphometric analyses of immunostained skin equivalents suggest that keratinocyte stratification and differentiation increases as channel depth increases and channel width decreases. This trend was most pronounced in channels with the highest depth-to-width ratios (i.e., 200 microm deep, 50 microm wide). It is anticipated that the findings from these studies will elucidate design parameters to enhance the performance of future bioengineered skin substitutes.

17434188|t|Effects of environmental air pollution on endogenous oxidative DNA damage in humans.
17434188|a|Epidemiological studies conducted in metropolitan areas have demonstrated that exposure to environmental air pollution is associated with increases in mortality. Carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (c-PAHs) are the major source of genotoxic activities of organic mixtures associated with respirable particulate matter, which is a constituent of environmental air pollution. In this study,we wanted to evaluate the relationship between exposure to these genotoxic compounds present in the air and endogenous oxidative DNA damage in three different human populations exposed to varying levels of environmental air pollution. As measures of oxidative DNA damage we have determined 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and cyclic pyrimidopurinone N-1,N(2) malondialdehyde-2'-deoxyguanosine (M(1)dG) by the immunoslot blot assay from lymphocyte DNA of participating individuals. The level of endogenous oxidative DNA damage was significantly increased in individuals exposed to environmental air pollution compared to unexposed individuals from Kosice (8-oxodG adducts) and Sofia (M(1)dG adducts). However, there was no significant difference in the level of endogenous oxidative DNA and exposure to environmental air pollution in individuals from Prague (8-oxodG and M(1)dG adducts) and Kosice (M(1)dG adducts). The average level of M(1)dG adducts was significantly lower in unexposed and exposed individuals from Kosice compared to those from Prague and Sofia. The average level of 8-oxodG adducts was significantly higher in unexposed and exposed individuals from Kosice compared to those from Prague. A significant increasing trend according to the interaction of c-PAHs exposure and smoking status was observed in levels of 8-oxodG adducts in individuals from Kosice. However, no other relationship was observed for M(1)dG and 8-oxodG adduct levels with regard to the smoking status and c-PAH exposure status of the individuals. The conclusion that can be made from this study is that environmental air pollution may alter the endogenous oxidative DNA damage levels in humans but the effect appears to be related to the country where the individuals reside. Genetic polymorphisms of the genes involved in metabolism and detoxification and also differences in the DNA repair capacity and antioxidant status of the individuals could be possible explanations for the variation observed in the level of endogenous oxidative DNA damage for the different populations.

6918202|t|Dose response of elastase-induced emphysema in hamsters.
6918202|a|Elastase-induced emphysema in hamsters was studied using pulmonary function tests in an effort to develop techniques for determining the effects of air pollutants on the progression of this disease. Single intratracheal injections of 6, 12, or 24 units of porcine pancreatic elastase produced dose-related changes in pulmonary function after 4 wk when compared with sham-injected control animals. Boyle's law end-expiratory volume and residual volume, measured by gas dilution, increased (p less than 0.05) at 12 and 24 units, respectively, whereas vital capacity, determined plethysmographically, and total lung capacity wee increased (p less than 0.05) at all 3 elastase doses. Respiratory system compliance, calculated by a nonlinear least squares regression fit of the deflation pressure-volume curve, increased (p less than 0.05) at 24 units only. The multiple-breath nitrogen washout slope (N2 slope) and the single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) decreased (p less than 0.05) at all 3 doses of elastase. Both histologic and physiologic evaluation showed dose-related pulmonary impairment. It appears, therefore, that as little as 6 units of elastase produces mild emphysema in hamsters, which is detectable by pulmonary function testing. Of these tests, the DLCO and N2 slope were the most effective in detecting the degree of impairment.

480515|a|Serum samples from 153 woodchucks (Marmota monax) from Tompkins County, New York, obtained in 1976 and 1977, were examined by plate agglutination tests for antibodies against five Leptospira antigens. Fourteen sera showed significant titers against either L. hardjo, L. icterohemorrhagiae and/or L. pomona. Reactions against L. hardjo were the most frequent. Woodchucks collected from two dairy farms with histories of bovine leptospirosis did not have a greater prevalence of antibodies than woodchucks collected from other locations. Each of two woodchucks experimentally-inoculated with L. hardjo developed titers to L. hardjo. Maximum titers occurred approximately 30 days post-inoculation. L. hardjo was not observed in urine specimens of these animals.

11402218|t|Cloning and expression pattern of a gene encoding an alpha-xylosidase active against xyloglucan oligosaccharides from Arabidopsis.
11402218|a|An alpha-xylosidase active against xyloglucan oligosaccharides was purified from cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) leaves. Two peptide sequences were obtained from this protein, the N-terminal and an internal one, and these were used to identify an Arabidopsis gene coding for an alpha-xylosidase that we propose to call AtXYL1. It has been mapped to a region of chromosome I between markers at 100.44 and 107.48 cM. AtXYL1 comprised three exons and encoded a peptide that was 915 amino acids long, with a potential signal peptide of 22 amino acids and eight possible N-glycosylation sites. The protein encoded by AtXYL1 showed the signature regions of family 31 glycosyl hydrolases, which comprises not only alpha-xylosidases, but also alpha-glucosidases. The alpha-xylosidase activity is present in apoplastic extractions from Arabidopsis seedlings, as suggested by the deduced signal peptide. The first eight leaves from Arabidopsis plants were harvested to analyze alpha-xylosidase activity and AtXYL1 expression levels. Both increased from older to younger leaves, where xyloglucan turnover is expected to be higher. When this gene was introduced in a suitable expression vector and used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae, significantly higher alpha-xylosidase activity was detected in the yeast cells. alpha-Glucosidase activity was also increased in the transformed cells, although to a lesser extent. These results show that AtXYL1 encodes for an apoplastic alpha-xylosidase active against xyloglucan oligosaccharides that probably also has activity against p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucoside.

16612926|t|Endovascular stent-graft placement in the descending aorta through an ascending aorto-bifemoral bypass.
16612926|a|PURPOSE: To report a combined conventional and endovascular strategy to treat a descending aorta anastomotic aneurysm. CASE REPORT: A 60-year-old man with previous obliteration of the infra renal aorta suffered from bilateral lower limb acute ischemia. Lower limb vascularization was provided by a previous thoraco-bifemoral bypass. Computed tomography and angiography revealed an aortic anastomotic false aneurysm and an embolic aspect of the first centimeters of the graft. Treatment combined revascularisation of the lower limbs by an ascending aorta bifemoral bypass through a median sternotomy and endovascular coverage of the false aneurysm by stent-graft placement in the descending aorta. Stent-grafts were introduced through a graft's limb and across the anastomosis in the ascending aorta. Imaging at 3 months revealed no endoleak and perfect patency of the bypass. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates how combined endovascular and conventional procedures can minimize surgical risks in complex cases.

7903176|t|Neurotransmitter control of neocortical neuronal activity and excitability.
7903176|a|The pattern of activity and excitability of cortical neurons and neuronal circuits is dependent upon the interaction between glutamatergic and GABAergic fast-activating transmitter systems as well as the state of the more slowly acting transmitters such as ACh, norepinephrine, 5-HT, and histamine. Through the activation of GABAA receptors, GABAergic neurons regulate the amplitude and duration of EPSPs and, in so doing, control the level of functional activation of NMDA receptors. In contrast, activation of muscarinic, adrenergic, serotoninergic, histaminergic, and glutamate metabotropic receptors controls the excitability and pattern of action potential generation in identified pyramidal cells through increases or decreases in various K+ conductances. Activation of muscarinic, alpha 1-adrenergic, or glutamate metabotropic receptors on layer V burst-generating corticotectal or corticopontine neurons results in depolarization through a reduction in a K+ conductance and a switch in the firing mode from repetitive burst firing to single-spike activity. In contrast, activation of muscarinic, beta-adrenergic, H2-histaminergic, and serotoninergic receptors on regular-spiking layer II/III, V, and/or VI corticogeniculate pyramidal cells results in a decrease in spike frequency adaptation and increased responsiveness to depolarizing inputs through a reduction in a slow Ca(2+)-activated K+ current IAHP, and/or a voltage-dependent K+ current, IM. Through these, and other, mechanisms the spatial and temporal pattern of activity generated in cortical circuits is regulated by both intracortical and extracortical neurotransmitter systems.

6673905|t|Long-term effects of vasectomy. Part II: Immunological parameters. An ICMR Task Force study on regulation of male fertility (surgical approaches).
6673905|a|A cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess the long-term immunological sequelae of vasectomy with respect to humoral response as well as the cell-mediated immune response (CMI) to spermatozoa. In the humoral response, circulating immune-complexes (CICs) were also estimated and attempts were made to investigate whether the development of antibodies to spermatozoa had any association with the HLA system. Four different techniques, viz. tray agglutination test (TAT), spermatozoa immobilization test (SIT), cellular-radioimmunoassay (CRIA) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to estimate antibodies to spermatozoa. Serum samples were considered positive when at least two of the above mentioned techniques gave a positive response to spermatozoal antigens. The results indicated that 37.5% of the vasectomized men developed antibodies to spermatozoa. CICs were present in 12% of the vasectomized subjects and 4% of the controls. 59.3% of the vasectomized who showed the presence of CICs, were negative to the presence of antibodies to spermatozoa. The HLA antigen frequency in the vasectomized subjects did not differ in individuals with and without spermatozoal antibodies. The CMI response to spermatozoa was negative in vasectomized subjects.

Little or no information was obtained from the lay media or the product brochure. Two thirds of the personnel to whom the vaccine was offered accepted the vaccine. The major reason for accepting the vaccine was a perceived high-risk of contracting hepatitis B. In contrast, one third of the high-risk individuals offered the vaccine declined the opportunity. The major reason for not accepting the vaccine was concern with potential side effects. This information would have been helpful during the planning phase of the program.

11428704|t|Prolonged cerebellin administration inhibits the growth, but enhances steroidogenic capacity of rat adrenal cortex.
11428704|a|Cerebellin is a 16-amino acid peptide, that has been previously found to acutely stimulate steroid secretion from rat adrenal cortex in vivo and in vitro. We have investigated the effects of a prolonged cerebellin treatment (daily injections of 15 nmoles/kg for 6 consecutive days) on the growth and secretion of rat adrenal cortex. Cerebellin lowered adrenal weight, and morphometry showed that this was due to the decrease in the volume of each adrenocortical zone exclusively ensuing from the reduction in the number of its parenchymal cells. Cerebellin did not alter plasma concentration of ACTH, but it raised the levels of circulating aldosterone and corticosterone. The conclusion is drawn that cerebellin chronic administration evokes a marked hypoplastic atrophy of rat adrenocortical cells, that is coupled with an enhanced ACTH-independent steroidogenic capacity of the remaining parenchymal cells.

In order to further delineate the sequences which mediate this complex pattern of regulation, putative regulatory sequences were assayed for function in transgenic tobacco plants in the context of an inactive 5' deleted rbcS-3A test gene. We have identified a minimal functional unit of 58 bp which is able to confer organ-specific transcriptional activity. It contains two sequences conserved among the pea rbcS family members, namely box II (-151 to -138; GTGTGGTTAATATG) and box III (-125 to -114; ATCATTTTCACT). These sequences bind the nuclear factor termed GT-1 in vitro. Substitution mutations within this 58 bp element have demonstrated that sequences upstream of, or located between, boxes II and III are not required for the transcriptional activity conferred by this element. Distance and orientation of these sequences from the gene are not critical for activity within the limits tested. DNA fragments upstream of nucleotide -170 of rbcS-3A that contain other GT-1 binding sites can also confer regulated expression upon the rbcS-3A promoter deleted to -50. Multimers of individual motifs, namely four tandem copies of boxes II and III, are unable to drive expression of the deleted promoter. These observations suggest that while GT-1 binding is necessary for promoter activity it is by itself not sufficient.

17883932|t|[Work-related behavior and experience of physicians in the third to eighth year of their professional life]
17883932|a|OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological data show psychosocial health risks for physicians. This study identifies psychosocial health resources and risk factors in profession-related experience and behavior of physicians. METHODS: A written survey with the questionnaire "Pattern of work-related coping behavior (AVEM)" and the "Questionnaire for the assessment of dispositional self-awareness (SAM)" was sent to physicians in Schleswig-Holstein, Sudbaden and graduates of the private University of Witten-Herdecke. The response rate of the 1204 physicians addressed was 31.6 % (n = 381), of which n = 344 (in the third to eighth year of their professional life) were further analyzed. RESULTS: 39.9 % of the physicians showed psychosocial strain patterns with a tendency toward overexertion or resignation. 43.4 % showed a reduced working motivation. Only 16.7 % showed healthy and motivated behavior and experience patterns. The public self-awareness scores of the study group were higher than in a norm sample. CONCLUSIONS: The results show distinct psychosocial strain patterns in physicians. Health promotion and prevention of psychosocial symptoms and impairment therefore appear to be important issues during physicians' education as well as their further training.

7500013|t|A hypoxia-responsive element mediates a novel pathway of activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase promoter.
7500013|a|Picolinic acid, a catabolite of L-tryptophan, activates the transcription of the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS) in IFN-gamma-treated murine macrophages. We performed functional studies on the 5' flanking region of the iNOS gene linked to a CAT reporter gene to identify the cis-acting element(s) responsible for the activation of iNOS transcription by picolinic acid. Transient transfection assays showed that the full-length iNOS promoter in the murine macrophage cell line ANA-1 was activated by the synergistic interaction between IFN-gamma and picolinic acid. Deletion or mutation of the iNOS promoter region from -227 to -209, containing a sequence homology to a hypoxia-responsive enhancer (iNOS-HRE), decreased picolinic acid- but not LPS-induced CAT activity by more than 70%. Functional studies using a tk promoter-CAT reporter gene plasmid demonstrated that the iNOS-HRE was sufficient to confer inducibility by picolinic acid but not by IFN-gamma or LPS. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that picolinic acid alone induced a specific binding activity to the iNOS-HRE. Furthermore, we found that the iNOS-HRE activity was inducible by hypoxia and that hypoxia in combination with IFN-gamma activated the iNOS promoter in transient transfection assays and induced iNOS transcription and mRNA expression. These data establish that the iNOS-HRE is a novel regulatory element of the iNOS promoter activity in murine macrophages and provide the first evidence that iNOS is a hypoxia-inducible gene.

9440058|t|Epidemiology of dyspepsia: discriminant value of smoking and Helicobacter pylori status as predictors of peptic lesions in primary care.
9440058|a|Male gender and smoking have an established discriminant value of increased risk for duodenal ulcers. The present analysis is focused on whether this could be generally enhanced by considering Helicobacter pylori status in dyspeptic patients consulting their primary physician. Patients were enrolled into our Dyspepsia Study if they met the following criteria: Symptoms for minimum one month, informed consent for drug trial, including upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE), if required. All were prospectively screened for criteria suggesting an organic origin of the disorder such as nocturnal pain, severe pain, severe regurgitation or heartburn, loss of weight, pain relieved by food, age > 50 years. 16% of patients had one or more relevant lesion: 7.8% oesophagitis, 8.5% duodenal ulcers, and 1.8% gastric ulcers. Of the clinical criteria enumerated only nocturnal pain and/or severe regurgitation or heartburn had a marginal discriminant power (P < 0.1). In contrast smoking and/or positive CLO-urease test had a substantial and significant (P < 0.001), discriminant value both for oesophagitis and duodenal ulcers. Patients with both a positive CLO-urease test and who smoked accounted for only 16% of the population but for 46% of the lesions, but this was only 4% for the 42% subjects who were non-smokers and had a negative CLO-urease test. Positive H. pylori status and smoking appear to have an important and probably additive discriminant value to distinguish between organic and functional dyspepsia.

15770591|t|The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
15770591|a|The aim of this paper is to review the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in neonates with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). The difficulties in identifying patients with fatal lung hypoplasia are highlighted and the role of adjunctive therapies on ECMO (surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide, high-frequency ventilation and liquid lung distension) as well as the timing of surgical repair is discussed. Survivors of severe CDH who have been supported on ECMO have significant late mortality and morbidity. There remains a need for a randomized controlled trial of the role of ECMO in neonates with severe CDH.

9877419|t|Capsaicin desensitization and stimulus-induced recovery on facial compared to lingual skin.
9877419|a|It was recently demonstrated that capsaicin desensitization of the tongue can be temporarily reversed during bouts of recurrent or constant stimulation. The present study investigated whether this "stimulus-induced recovery" (SIR) also occurs on skin other than the oral mucosa. Twenty-two subjects received capsaicin treatments on the cheek and on the tongue tip at concentrations (330 and 33 microM) that produced approximately equal sensory irritation on the two sites. Desensitization and SIR occurred on both test sites, although the longer time course of irritation on the face changed the magnitude and form of SIR. There were large individual differences in the extent of desensitization and recovery, and the two phenomena were not correlated across sites, i.e., the capacity for SIR on the tongue was not a good predictor of an individual's capacity for SIR on the face. The results are discussed in terms of possible sources of regional and individual differences, and the implications they may have for the efficacy of topical analgesics that contain capsaicin.

15502343|t|Structure of the phenazine biosynthesis enzyme PhzG.
15502343|a|PhzG is a flavin-dependent oxidase that is believed to play a role in phenazine antibiotic synthesis in various bacteria, including Pseudomonas. Phenazines are chorismic acid derivatives that provide the producing organisms, including the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa, with a competitive growth advantage. Here, the crystal structures of PhzG from both P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens solved in an unliganded state at 1.9 and 1.8 A resolution, respectively, are described. Although the specific reaction in phenazine biosynthesis catalyzed by PhzG is unknown, the structural data indicates that PhzG is closely related to pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase, the Escherichia coli pdxH gene product, which catalyzes the final step in pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) biosynthesis. A previous proposal suggested that the physiological substrate of PhzG to be 2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (DHHA), a phenazine precursor produced by the sequential actions of the PhzE and PhzD enzymes on chorismate, and that two DHHA molecules dimerized in another enzyme-catalyzed reaction to yield phenazine-1-carboxylate. However, it was not possible to demonstrate any in vitro activity upon incubation of PhzG and DHHA. Interestingly, analysis of the in vitro activities of PhzG in combination with PhzF suggests that PhzF acts on DHHA and that PhzG then reacts with a non-aromatic tricyclic phenazine precusor to catalyze an oxidation/aromatization reaction that yields phenazine-1-carboxylate. It is proposed that phzG arose by duplication of pdxH and that the subtle differences seen between the structures of PhzG and PdxH correlate with the loss of the ability of PhzG to catalyze PLP formation. Sequence alignments and superimpositions of the active sites of PhzG and PdxH reveal that the residues that form a positively charged pocket around the phosphate of PLP in the PdxH-PLP complex are not conserved in PhzG, consistent with the inability of phosphorylated compounds to serve as substrates for PhzG.

15629263|t|Effects of salmeterol on cilia and mucus in COPD and pneumonia patients.
15629263|a|The present study was performed to evaluate the effects of salmeterol xynaphoate on ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of nasal epithelium and on rheological parameters of tracheobronchial mucus. We studied 10 steady-state COPD patients, eight patients with community-acquired pneumonia and eight healthy subjects as controls. They underwent a nasal brushing of the inferior turbinate to study the CBF in basal conditions and following application of salmeterol at 10(-5), 10(-6), 10(-7) and 10(-8) M concentrations directly to the epithelial samples. We also collected sputum samples, in COPD patients only, by the technique for "protected expectoration" for the rheological assessment in basal conditions and following addition of salmeterol at 10(-5), 10(-6), 10(-7) and 10(-8) M concentrations. Only samples with basal viscosity values higher than 2000 mPa/s were admitted. Our results confirmed previous studies that demonstrate a ciliostimulating effect induced by salmeterol. The mean basal CBF was 11.18 +/- 0.75 Hz in control subjects, while the pathological subjects showed a markedly lower basal values: 8.64 +/- 0.88 Hz (p = 0.000) and 8.83 +/- 0.68 Hz (p = 0.000), in COPD and pneumonia patients, respectively. Salmeterol induced ciliostimulation in both patients groups as well as the healthy controls. The maximum increase in CBF, highly significant, was obtained at 10(-6) M concentrations of salmeterol, while this effect decreased at lower concentrations. Regarding the action of salmeterol on rheological parameters, a direct effect of salmeterol on mucus cannot been demonstrated and the described beneficial clinical effects on mucociliary clearance occurring in vivo are probably related to an indirect effect of stimulation of ciliary beat. This preliminary study suggests that, in addition to COPD, salmeterol could be a useful therapeutic agent in pneumonia also, for its positive effect on ciliary movement other than bronchodilation, but this finding needs further investigations.

16203911|t|Remodeling in cells from different regions of the reentrant circuit during ventricular tachycardia.
16203911|a|BACKGROUND: Anisotropic reentrant excitation occurs in the remodeled substrate of the epicardial border zone (EBZ) of the 5-day infarcted canine heart. Reentry is stabilized because of the formation of functional lines of block. We hypothesized that regional differences of ionic currents in cells of the EBZ form these lines of block. Therefore, we first mapped reentrant circuits of sustained tachycardias, then dispersed cells (infarct zone cells, IZs) from the central common pathway of the circuit (IZc) as well as from the other side of the line of block (outer pathway, IZo) for study. METHODS AND RESULTS: We mapped reentrant circuits in the EBZ of infarcted hearts during sustained ventricular tachycardias (>30 seconds, n=17 episodes, cycle lengths=218+/-7.9 ms). INa density was reduced in both IZc and IZo, and the kinetic properties of IZc INa were markedly altered versus IZo. Structural remodeling of the sodium channel protein Nav1.5 occurred in IZs, with cell surface localization differing from normal cells. Both IZc and IZo have similar but reduced ICaL, whereas IZc showed changes in Ca2+ current kinetics with an acceleration of current decay. Computer simulations of the 2D EBZ showed that incorporating only differences between INa in IZc and IZo prevented stability of the reentrant circuit. Incorporating only differences between ICaL in the IZc and IZo cells also prevented stability of the circuit. However, incorporating both INa and ICaL current differences stabilized the simulated reentrant circuit, and lines of block formed between the 2 distinct regions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in INa and ICaL properties in cells of the center and outer pathways of a reentrant circuit, the resulting changes in effective refractory periods tend to stabilize reentry in this remodeled substrate.

11270442|t|Slow and fast visual motion channels have independent binocular-rivalry stages.
11270442|a|We have previously reported a transparent motion after-effect indicating that the human visual system comprises separate slow and fast motion channels. Here, we report that the presentation of a fast motion in one eye and a slow motion in the other eye does not result in binocular rivalry but in a clear percept of transparent motion. We call this new visual phenomenon 'dichoptic motion transparency' (DMT). So far only the DMT phenomenon and the two motion after-effects (the 'classical' motion after-effect, seen after motion adaptation on a static test pattern, and the dynamic motion after-effect, seen on a dynamic-noise test pattern) appear to isolate the channels completely. The speed ranges of the slow and fast channels overlap strongly and are observer dependent. A model is presented that links after-effect durations of an observer to the probability of rivalry or DMT as a function of dichoptic velocity combinations. Model results support the assumption of two highly independent channels showing only within-channel rivalry, and no rivalry or after-effect interactions between the channels. The finding of two independent motion vision channels, each with a separate rivalry stage and a private line to conscious perception, might be helpful in visualizing or analysing pathways to consciousness.

12881983|t|[The effect of phorbol ester in a wide range of concentrations on the lipid structure of microsome membranes of tumor cells in vitro]
12881983|a|The action of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate (TPA) in vitro in a wide range of concentration from 10(-3) mol/l down to ultra-low doses 10(-23) mol/l and dilution 10(-24) mol/l on the microsome membranes isolated from tumor--Ehrlich ascite carcinoma (EAC) has been studied by ESR-method using two spin probes: 5- and 16-doxyl stearates (5- and 16-DS) localized in the different regions of lipid bilayer. From the ESR spectra obtained it was calculated the following parameters: an order of the long axis 5-DS (S) related to order of the fatty acids chains in the lipid bilayer; two rotation correlation times (Tc1 and Tc2) of 16-DC to estimate a microviscosity value and structural-sensitive ones. It was found the stage changes of all these parameters (increase and decrease) as compared with control level (the membranes untreated by TPA) depending on TPA concentration into the range of 10(-3)-10(-24) mol/l; in particular, the most significant shape changes of structural-sensitive parameters have been observed at TPA doses below 10(-16) mol/l. It is concluded that tumor membranes are very sensitive to TPA action in vitro in a wide range of concentration included ultra-low doses.

11451755|t|Distribution of lipid deposits around aortic branches of mice lacking LDL receptors and apolipoprotein E.
11451755|a|Mice with inactivated genes are increasingly used as models of human atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the characteristic age-related distributions of lipid deposition seen around human arterial branches are replicated in such mice. Lesions occur downstream of branch ostia in immature human aortas, but these regions are spared in adult vessels, with lesions occurring more frequently at the sides or upstream of the branches. We determined the pattern of lipid staining around 102 intercostal branch ostia from apolipoprotein E/low density lipoprotein receptor double-knockout mice aged 9 to 20 weeks by using en face microscopy and a frequency-mapping technique. Lesion prevalence was high in the ostium and the region immediately surrounding it. Frequencies were 2.12+/-0.30 (mean+/-SEM, n=11) times higher upstream than downstream (P<0.01), but the pattern did not resemble the adult human pattern: there were no peaks in frequency at the sides or upstream of the branch, and there was no sparing downstream. Furthermore, a patch of sparing upstream of the branch was seen, which has not been reported for human vessels, and there was no trend toward a more upstream pattern with age. We conclude that knockout mice may not be a suitable model in which to investigate localizing factors.

10193291|t|Effects of inhaled oxygen concentration on fat metabolism during propofol infusion in rabbits.
10193291|a|We have investigated the effect of inhaled oxygen tension on lipid metabolism during propofol infusion. Propofol is supplied as a lipid emulsion containing 10% soybean oil, which is rich in triglycerides (TG). Infused TG are metabolized via three pathways in the liver cell; Krebs cycle, ketogenesis and release as very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) into the blood. For this reason, we measured TG and the products of the three pathways; carbon dioxide, ketone bodies and VLDL. Thirty-two rabbits were anaesthetized under four different conditions: propofol under hyperoxia, normoxia, hypoxia and isoflurane anaesthesia under hyperoxia. Our results indicated that hyperoxia produced more ketone bodies, normoxia more PaCO2 and hypoxia more free fatty acids (FFA) and TG compared with the other propofol infusion groups. We conclude that hyperoxia during propofol infusion facilitated fat metabolism through ketogenesis, while normoxia did so via the Krebs cycle. Also, hypoxia suppressed utilization of TG and VLDL production in the liver.

12586443|t|Role of the JAK-STAT pathway in protection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.
12586443|a|The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway is a stress-responsive mechanism that transduces signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, thereby modulating gene expression. Recent studies have demonstrated that myocardial ischemia and reperfusion induce rapid activation of this pathway. Although the functional consequences of this event remain to be elucidated, there is emerging evidence that JAK-STAT signaling plays an important role in the development of the cardioprotected phenotype associated with ischemic preconditioning. Specifically, brief episodes of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion activate JAK1 and JAK2, followed by recruitment of STAT1 and STAT3, resulting in transcriptional upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which then mediate the infarct-sparing effects of the late phase of preconditioning. The present review focuses on this novel cardioprotective role of JAK-STAT signaling and on its potential exploitation for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at limiting ischemia/reperfusion injury.

17520196|t|Molecular genetics of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia.
17520196|a|BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that noninvasive precursor lesions, classified as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), can progress to invasive pancreatic cancer. This review will discuss the major genetic alterations in PanIN lesions. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed in order to find studies on the molecular profile of human PanIN lesions. In addition, recent publications on genetically engineered mouse models of preinvasive neoplasia and pancreatic cancers were reviewed. RESULTS: PanINs demonstrate abnormalities at the genomic (DNA), transcriptomic (RNA), and proteomic levels, and there is a progressive accumulation of molecular alterations that accompany the histological progression from low-grade PanIN-1A to high-grade PanIN-3 lesions. Molecular changes in PanINs can be classified as "early" (KRAS2 mutations, telomere shortening, p21(WAF1/CIP1) up-regulation, etc.), "intermediate" (cyclin D1 up-regulation, expression of proliferation antigens, etc.), or "late" (BRCA2 and TP53 mutations, DPC4/SMAD4/MADH4 inactivation, etc.). All the genetic changes observed in PanINs are also found in invasive ductal adenocarcinomas, where they usually occur at a higher frequency. Genetically engineered mice expressing mutant Kras in the pancreas, with or without additional genetic alterations, provide a unique in vivo platform to study the pancreatic cancer progression model. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular studies have been instrumental in establishing that PanIN lesions are the noninvasive precursors for invasive ductal adenocarcinomas. The availability of molecular date provides the basis for designing rational early detection strategies and therapeutic intervention trials before pancreatic neoplasms invade, with the intention of alleviating the dismal prognosis associated with this disease.

8959678|t|Lung cancer in patients with HIV-infection.
8959678|a|PURPOSE: To identify and review the clinical characteristics and natural history of lung cancer in HIV-seropositive patients. A secondary objective was to compare the clinical features of HIV-seropositive and HIV-indeterminate lung cancer cases at our institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with HIV infection and lung cancer were diagnosed between January 1988 and March 1995 at our institution and the clinical records were reviewed. HIV-indeterminate lung cancer cases were identified by the Albany Medical Center Hospital (AMCH) Tumor Registry. A Medline database search of HIV infection/AIDS and lung cancer was undertaken through December 1994. The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), Bureau of Cancer Epidemiology provided information on the incidence of lung cancer among residents of New York State by county of residence. Case reports and series regarding the clinical features of HIV-seropositive patients with lung cancer were reviewed. A more focused comparison between HIV-seropositive and HIV-indeterminate male lung cancer cases between 35 and 54 years of age at our institution was performed. The following clinical variables were identified in our 16 patients and 109 cases extracted from available clinical reports: sex, age, year and county of residence at time of lung cancer diagnosis, cigarette smoking history, HIV risk behavior, CD4 count at time of lung cancer diagnosis, CDC classification of HIV disease, interval in months from time of HIV seropositivity to lung cancer diagnosis, pathology and stage of lung cancer, performance status, treatment, response, and survival. RESULTS: Lung cancer in HIV-seropositive patients is characterized by the following: a younger age at time of diagnosis when compared to HIV-indeterminate cases; the majority of cases occur in a background of extensive cigarette smoking; over 80% of patients present with advanced stage of lung cancer (stage III and IV); up to 50% of cases have asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic HIV infection with a median CD4 lymphocyte count of 233 per microliter; there is a predominance of adenocarcinoma histopathology; and shortened survival when compared to HIV-indeterminate cases. CONCLUSION: Current reports of lung carcinoma in HIV-seropositive patients suggest that the natural history of this disease is different than in HIV-indeterminate cases. Lung cancer must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a solitary mass lesion on chest X-ray in HIV-seropositive patients.

15870547|t|Low normal level of protein C or of antithrombin increases risk for recurrent cardiovascular events.
15870547|a|The relationship between haemostatic factors and recurrent cardiovascular events was investigated in patients enrolled with acute coronary syndrome (acute non-Q myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris). One hundred and fifteen patients, aged 64 +/- 10 years, were included in the study. Haemostatic parameters [prothrombin time, activities of factor VII, factor VIII, factor X, antithrombin (AT) and protein C (PC), and concentrations of free protein S, fibrinogen, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2, and thrombin-antithrombin complex] were measured four times: within 48 h of hospitalization, at discharge (days 5-8), at 3 months and after 1 year. Screening for factor V Leiden mutation was also performed. Patients were followed for cardiovascular endpoints (new or refractory unstable angina pectoris, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or death) for an average of 555 days. Of all patients, 35 had an endpoint during the follow-up ("endpoint" group) and 80 patients did not ("no endpoint" group). Analysing the whole follow-up period, PC (P < 0.01) and AT (P < 0.01) were lower in the "endpoint" than in the "no endpoint" group. With 50% percentiles at enrollment, the odds ratio for getting an endpoint in the low (cut-off value < 100%) versus high PC group was 2.72 (95% confidence interval, 1.18-6.29; P < 0.05). Lower levels of AT (P < 0.05) and PC (P < 0.05) during the whole follow-up were associated with a shorter event-free time. In conclusion, lower PC and AT values, even within the normal range, seem to be associated with elevated risk for recurrent cardiovascular events and shorter event-free time in acute coronary syndrome patients.

1309309|t|A clinical and radiologic study of primary liver cancer associated with extrahepatic primary cancer.
1309309|a|In a consecutive series of 393 patients with excised and pathologically proven primary liver cancer (PLC)--including 374 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), nine cholangiocellular carcinomas (CCC), and ten mixed type of HCC and CCC--33 patients (8.4%) had one or two other malignancies in the extrahepatic organ(s). Of these, 29 had double cancers and four, triple cancers. This was synchronous in 11 patients, metachronous in 20 (including 18 with double cancers and two with triple cancers) and synchronous and metachronous in two with triple cancers. Metachronous cancer was found in 21 patients 1 year before hepatectomy for PLC and in three patients, 1 year after hepatectomy. The median age of PLC patients with multiple primary cancer (MPC) was 63.6 +/- 6.9 years; this was significantly greater than that of PLC patients without MPC (P less than 0.01). The associated cancer was gastric cancer in 11 patients (29.7%), colorectal cancer in six, pharyngeal cancer in four, and other cancers in ten different organs in 16. Thirteen of 22 patients had a history of blood transfusion. The incidence of liver cirrhosis in PLC associated with MPC (57.6%) was significantly lower than that without MPC (82.8%, P less than 0.01). The differential diagnosis of PLC from liver metastasis was possible retrospectively in 78.6% using sonograms, 79.3% using computed tomograms, and 91.3% using angiograms. The survival rates of patients with PLC with (n = 33) and without (n = 299) MPC who had undergone hepatectomy were 97.0% and 85.4% at 1 year, 55.5% and 59.5% at 3 years, and 40.5% and 40.1% at 5 years, respectively. There was no significant difference between the survival rates of those who underwent operations for PLC and extrahepatic primary cancer(s) synchronously and metachronously.

12023280|t|Enzymatic hydrolysis of pyridoxine-5'-beta-D-glucoside is catalyzed by intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase.
12023280|a|An obligatory step in the mammalian nutritional utilization of pyridoxine-5'-beta-D-glucoside (PNG) is the intestinal hydrolysis of its beta-glucosidic bond that releases pyridoxine (PN). This laboratory previously reported the purification and partial characterization of a novel cytosolic enzyme, designated PNG hydrolase, which hydrolyzed PNG. An investigation of the subcellular distribution of intestinal PNG hydrolysis found substantial hydrolytic activity in the total membrane fraction, of which 40-50% was localized to brush border membrane. To investigate the possible role of a brush border beta-glucosidase in the hydrolysis of PNG, lactase phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) was purified from rat small intestinal mucosa. LPH hydrolyzed PNG with a K(m) of 1.0 +/- 0.1 mm, a V(max) of 0.11 +/- 0.01 micromol/min.mg protein, and a k(cat) of 1.0 s(-1). LPH-catalyzed PNG hydrolysis was inhibited by glucose, lactose, and cellobiose but not by PN. Specific blockage of the phlorizin hydrolase site of LPH using 2',4'-dintrophenyl-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside did not reduce PNG hydrolysis. Evidence of transferase activity was also obtained. Reaction mixtures containing LPH, PNG, and lactose yielded the formation of another PN derivative that was identified as a pyridoxine disaccharide. These results indicate that LPH may play an important role in the bioavailability of PNG, but further characterization is needed to assess its physiological function.

9701042|t|Gender differences in nitric oxide production by alveolar macrophages in ethanol plus lipopolysaccharide-treated rats.
9701042|a|Alveolar macrophages (AMs) constitute an important first line of host defense against infection in the lung, and NO is an essential component of the microbicidal activity of cytokine-activated macrophages. Previously we studied the respiratory burst, protein kinase C activity, and NO generation in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated AMs and gender differences in phagocytosis in ethanol (EtOH)-intoxicated rats. Now we have investigated NO production by AMs in EtOH plus LPS-treated male and female rats. Rats were infused iv with EtOH for 3 h to a blood level of approximately 180 mg/dl. At 90 min of infusion, Escherichia coli LPS (750 microg/kg) was injected i.v. Controls received saline (SAL) + LPS. AMs were isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage and cultured for 20 h in the absence and presence of LPS, interferon-y (IFN), and LPS + IFN. Nitrite was determined in the medium and was taken as an index of NO production. EtOH alone resulted in no significant differences compared with SAL infusion. LPS treatment caused a decrease in basal and an increase in LPS and IFN-stimulated generation of NO in males and females. EtOH + LPS treatment vs EtOH showed no significant differences. There are gender differences in both spontaneous and in vitro stimulated NO production by AMs. AMs of female rats treated with SAL + LPS released significantly more NO spontaneously than AMs of equally treated male rats. Cells of SAL + LPS-treated male rats activated in vitro by LPS and IFN-gamma produced significantly greater amounts of NO than AMs of female rats. These differences in activated induction of NO production were abrogated by ethanol treatment.

11055842|t|Effect of delayed placement on the incidence of Campylobacter jejuni in broiler chickens.
11055842|a|An experiment was conducted with broiler chickens to evaluate the effect of delayed placement on reused litter and the isolation of Campylobacter jejuni. The experiment also assessed the presence of C. jejuni in the crop following feed withdrawal periods in cages vs floor environments. Trial 1 utilized 320 female broiler chicks obtained from a commercial hatchery. The chicks were randomly placed into the following experimental groups that were replicated four times with 20 chicks per pen: 1) 0-h, 2) 24-h, 3) 48-h, and 4) 72-h delayed placement. Fecal samples were collected via the cloaca at 7, 14, 21, and 28 d of age; enriched in Bolton broth; and plated onto BBL agar. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated at 1 wk of age in the 48- and 72-h experimental groups but did not differ significantly from the others. Sampling results at 14 d of age showed that 63, 68, 73, and 80% of chicks were positive for the 0-, 24-, 48-, and 72-h treatments, respectively. At 28 d of age, 100% of all chicks sampled tested positive. In Trial 2, 60 market age broilers were evaluated for the presence of C. jejuni in the crop by subjecting them to 0-, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-h feed withdrawal times on litter or in wire cages. Crops were collected aseptically from the broilers, stomached, enriched in Bolton broth, and then plated on BBL agar. There were no significant (P < 0.05) differences between cage and floor withdrawal times for the presence of C. jejuni in the crop samples of broilers; however, there were significant differences in the length of withdrawal on the presence of C. jejuni. Collectively, these results suggested that the isolation of C. jejuni occurred earlier in broilers that were subjected to delayed placement on reused litter and that extended feed withdrawal times in cages or on litter may increase the possibility that the crop of broilers may contain a higher isolation rate of C. jejuni.

19097192|t|Cloning and expression analysis of the anterior parahox genes, Gsh1 and Gsh2 from Xenopus tropicalis.
19097192|a|Gsx class proteins are members of the ParaHox homeodomain transcription factor family with conserved roles in specification and patterning of the nervous system. We report the cloning of two Gsx genes, Gsh1 and Gsh2, from the frog Xenopus tropicalis. We demonstrate the existence of a single, intact Xenopus ParaHox cluster, containing Gsh1, Pdx, and Cdx2, plus three degenerate clusters containing Gsh2, Cdx1, and Cdx4. Anterior expression boundaries of genes from the intact ParaHox cluster are co-linear with respect to their genomic organization. We show that Gsh1 and Gsh2 exhibit complex, overlapping patterns of expression within the anterior nervous system from open neural plate stages. We also find that expression of Gsh2, Nkx6, and Msx1 across the medio-lateral axis of the amphibian neural plate is strikingly similar to that of related genes in the Drosophila neuroectoderm. These findings provide further evidence for a conserved pathway regulating dorso-ventral patterning in the Bilateria.

6503886|t|Grid controlled x-ray tube switching time: implications for rapid exposure control.
6503886|a|The transient response properties of a conventional grid controlled x-ray source and the implications for rapid exposure control are studied. The use of a cathode cable with a length of only 1 m to connect the x-ray tube and the grid control electronics results in a switching time of 19 microseconds. The phototiming artifacts from the delayed radiation delivered during this transition time can be severe for short pulses. An analog correction technique that anticipates the magnitude of the delayed radiation is used to overcome this limitation and allows accurate phototiming over a wide range of pulse widths ranging down to 20 microseconds.

10732010|t|Ovarian activity and plasma concentrations of progesterone and estradiol during pregnancy in jennies.
10732010|a|The objectives of this study were to determine ovarian activity (with ultrasound) and plasma concentrations of progesterone and estradiol during pregnancy in jennies. There was considerable ovarian activity during the second month of pregnancy. Secondary corpora lutea (total of 2 to 7 per jenny) were formed (mainly by luteinization) starting on Day 41.8 +/- 1.0 (range Days 38 to 46; ovulation = Day 0). The echogenicity of the primary and secondary corpora lutea gradually decreased during pregnancy. Plasma progesterone concentrations increased between Days 0 and 10 (0.9 and 19.9 ng/mL, respectively), gradually decreased to Day 30 (12.1 ng/mL), increased between Days 30 and 40 (plateau, at approximately 17 ng/mL), gradually declined from Days 110 to 160 (nadir of approximately 6 ng/mL), and remained nearly constant until increasing again just before parturition. Plasma estradiol concentrations increased gradually from Day 65, peaked (1.2 ng/mL) on Day 165 (> or = 1 ng/mL on Days 150 to 210), and decreased thereafter, with very low concentrations during the last 20 d before parturition. Ovarian function and hormone profiles were generally similar to those previously reported during pregnancy in mares.

4086486|t|Novel structure of the 5' end region of the human argininosuccinate synthetase gene.
4086486|a|The structure of the 5' end region of the human argininosuccinate synthetase (AS) gene was analyzed in detail. The 5' flanking region up to 350 nucleotides from the putative transcription initiation site is unusually G+C rich (80%). Three repeats of a CCGCCC sequence and one complementary GGGCGG sequence are present in this region. It contains no CCAAT box-like sequence, but does contain one typical TATA box and a 20 bases-long inverted repeat sequence that could form a stem and loop structure just upstream from the TATA box. An octanucleotide sequence, AGAAGTGA, found in the 5' flanking region of the AS gene is also commonly present in those regions of the two other human genes expressed mainly in the liver. These structural features of the AS gene indicate that it shares common structures with two completely different groups of genes, i.e. tissue-specific genes and housekeeping ones. Moreover, two enhancer core-like sequences, alternating purine-pyrimidines tracts and two independent Alu type highly repetitive sequences are apparent in the first intron of the AS gene.

2419757|t|GTP-binding proteins mediate transmitter inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels.
2419757|a|The modulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by hormones and neurotransmitters has important implications for the control of many Ca2+-dependent cellular functions including exocytosis and contractility. We made use of electrophysiological techniques, including whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones, to demonstrate a role for GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) as signal transducers in the noradrenaline- and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels. This action of the transmitters was blocked by: (1) preincubation of the cells with pertussis toxin (a bacterial exotoxin catalysing ADP-ribosylation of G-proteins); or (2) intracellular administration of guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-beta-S), a non-hydrolysable analogue of GDP that competitively inhibits the binding of GTP to G-proteins. Our findings provide the first direct demonstration of the G-protein-mediated inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels by neurotransmitters. This mode of transmitter action may explain the ability of noradrenaline and GABA to presynaptically inhibit Ca2+-dependent neurosecretion from DRG sensory neurones.

Eight of the boys were treated with hCG immediately before surgery. Germ cell AC-activity (3.2-3.4 pmoles cAMP/mg protein/min) was found in the adult testes with normal germ cell morphology. Furthermore, low but significant AC-activity (0.2-0.8 pmoles cAMP/mg protein/min) was noted in biopsies containing only primary spermatocytes. There was no Mn2+ dependent AC-activity in Sertoli cell only testes or in testes where only spermatogonia were observed. Treatment with hCG did not influence germ cell maturation or soluble Mn2+ dependent AC-activity.

6363086|t|Prognostic value of in vitro measurements of platelet aggregability and fibrinolytic activity in patients with reversible cerebral ischemic attacks.
6363086|a|Platelet aggregability and fibrinolytic activity were studied repeatedly in 83 patients with reversible cerebral ischemic attacks over a median follow-up period of 26 months. Platelet hyperaggregability, defined as in vitro secondary aggregation obtained by adenosine diphosphate concentration less than or equal to 1 mumol/l, was demonstrated in 36.1% or the patients examined 5-8 days after the attack, but only in 6% of age- and sex-matched blood donors (p less than 0.001). Fibrinolytic activity was reduced in 57.8% of the patients, as compared with 20.5% of the controls. At the time of follow-up only 8% of the survivors showed platelet hyperaggregability, whereas the fibrinolytic activity was still reduced in 44.4%. Over the observation period 21.7% of the patients had a stroke or died. No significant correlation was found between abnormalities of platelet aggregability or of fibrinolytic activity, when observed 5-8 days after the ischemic episode, and the subsequent risk of stroke or death. It is concluded that in patients with recent cerebral ischemic attacks the demonstration of platelet hyperaggregability or reduced fibrinolytic activity appears to be without prognostic significance.

12939376|t|Time course of the response of mitochondria from oxidative muscle during thermal acclimation of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss.
12939376|a|The time course of changes in the properties of mitochondria from oxidative muscle of rainbow trout was examined during warm (15 degrees C) and cold (5 degrees C) acclimation. Mitochondrial oxidative capacities showed a biphasic response during thermal acclimation: at a given assay temperature, capacities first increased and then decreased during warm acclimation and showed the inverse pattern during cold acclimation. This was most apparent for maximal rates of state 3 oxygen consumption expressed per mg mitochondrial protein. Rates expressed per nmol ADP-ATP translocase (ANT) showed this pattern during cold acclimation. A biphasic pattern was also apparent for state 4 and oligomycin-inhibited (state 4(ol)) rates of oxygen uptake expressed per mg protein. Changes in states 4 and 4(ol) were smaller during cold than warm acclimation. Warm acclimation reduced the proportion of cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase needed during mitochondrial substrate oxidation. Phospholipid concentrations per mg mitochondrial protein changed little with thermal acclimation. Mitochondrial properties changed more quickly during warm than cold acclimation. While the biochemical modifications during thermal acclimation may eventually compensate for the thermal change, compensation did not occur at its onset. Rather, the initial changes of mitochondrial oxidative capacity in response to temperature change accentuated the functional impact of the thermal change, and prolonged exposure to the new temperature was required to attain a degree of thermal compensation.

7673594|t|Ocular manifestations in female carriers of X-linked disorders.
7673594|a|BACKGROUND: Many X-linked recessive disorders are confined to the eye or have ocular manifestations. It is possible to determine the carrier status of females for some of these disorders through clinical examination, pedigree analysis or clinical laboratory investigation. METHODS: Examples of carrier manifestations are given for selected X-linked disorders, along with clinical examples in which these manifestations, or lack thereof, have been used in patient management. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Recognition that females may have manifestations suggestive of the carrier state gives the clinician important additional information for genetic counseling, which consequently allows the patient to make a more informed decision following counseling.

7268337|t|Primary cardiac tumours in infancy and childhood. A review and six case reports.
7268337|a|Primary cardiac tumours are rarities in infants and children. We have had 6 patients, aged 17 days to 10 years, with primary cardiac tumours: 1 had a fibroma, 1 had a myxoma, 2 had an haemangioma and 2 had a rhabdomyoma. Correct diagnosis was missed pre-operatively in 3 cases and finally established at autopsy. Three of the patients underwent cardiac operation-one of them unsuccessfully. At surgery the main difficulties were with tumour infiltration and the multifocal nature of some tumours. We conclude that the echo- and angiocardiography are essential tools in the diagnosis of primary cardiac tumours. Large tumours or conduction tissue infiltration means an extremely poor prognosis. Multifocal cardiac tumours can be successfully removed, even in newborn babies, and the outcome for the patients is also affected by other important factors, e.g. tuberous sclerosis in rhabdomyomas.

8347279|a|Iron regulatory elements (IREs) are a family of 28 nucleotide, non-coding elements which regulate the translation of ferritin mRNA (iron storage), erythroid delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase mRNA (heme synthesis) and the stability of the transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA (iron uptake). IREs in the 5' end control translation (ribosome binding) and IREs in the 3' end control turnover (degradation). The specific regulator protein, the IRE-BP, is a member of the aconitase family but binds RNA only in the apo form without the Fe-S cluster. Cellular iron alters the IRE/IRE-BP interaction leading to translation of ferritin and eALAS mRNAs but degradation of the TfR mRNA. IRE function requires proximity to the 5' cap, achieved either by a short leader (eALAS) or a long, base-pairing flanking region (FL) (ferritin); a conserved triplet of FL base pairs enhances repression of ferritin mRNA. TfR mRNA has five AU-rich IREs which can also form an alternate structure with inter-IRE base pairs, in the absence of the IRE-BP. Ferritin IREs regulate both translation repression (negative control-IRE-BP dependent) and enhancement (positive control-initiation factor dependent); IRE-BP binding induces conformational changes in the FL. IREs use CAGUGU/C to form a hairpin loop with specific variations in the stem such as internal or bulge loops. A current structural model obtained using metallonucleases (1,10-phenanthroline-Cu, Fe-EDTA, Fe-bleomycin) and a preliminary analysis of the NMR spectrum, is a distorted helix with folds. The effect of cellular iron, Fe-S clusters and heme on the IRE-BP/RNA is not completely understood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

3144590|t|Ultrastructural immunocytochemical localization of secretory proteins in autophagic vacuoles of parotid acinar cells of starved rats.
3144590|a|Previous studies have shown that reduction of mastication has marked effects on the structure and biochemistry of the rat parotid gland. Acute starvation results in the formation in the acinar cells of large autophagic vacuoles which contain lysosomal hydrolases and within which secretory granules appear to undergo degradation. In this study we used electron microscopic immunocytochemistry and antibodies to two secretory proteins, alpha-amylase and B1-immunoreactive protein, to determine whether secretory proteins are present in autophagic vacuoles of parotid acinar cells of starved rats. Small vacuoles were observed after 24-h starvation; they increased in size and number up to 72-h starvation. Both secretory proteins were present in the secretory granules and in the dense content of the autophagic vacuoles, as shown by immunogold labelling. The lighter matrix of the vacuoles was unlabelled. These findings confirm that secretory granules may fuse with lysosomal structures, where their content of secretory proteins is presumably degraded. Thus, the rat parotid appears to be similar to other secretory cells in which cellular levels of stored secretory proteins may be regulated by the process of crinophagy.

6315931|t|Early in vitro stimulation of endometrial (Na+-K+)-ATPase by estradiol.
6315931|a|Physiological concentrations of estradiol (2-10 nM) can approximately double the activity of the endometrical (Na+-K+)-ATPase in immature mammalians. This stimulation in vitro is optimum as early as 30 minutes after contact of uteri with the hormone and it is not inhibited by incubation with cycloheximide. Analogues of 17 beta estradiol have little effect on the enzyme activity, but another steroid hormone testosterone, is capable of a similar activating effect.

1455173|t|Genetic variation of human aspartic proteinases.
1455173|a|The human aspartic proteinases include pepsinogen A, pepsinogen C, cathepsin D, cathepsin E and renin. Comparative analysis of the proteinase genes reveals a high degree of similarity with regard to their respective coding sequences and the location of exon-intron junctions. Despite strong conservation of the regions containing the active site aspartyl groups, genetic polymorphisms have been identified for each of the proteinase genes with the exception of cathepsin D. These genetic polymorphisms are useful for localization of genes on linkage maps as well as determination of gene copy number. The chromosomal location of each aspartyl proteinase has been determined by a variety of gene mapping methods employing recombinant DNA probes including; analysis of somatic cell hybrid mapping panels, in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosome preparations and family linkage analysis with polymorphic markers. Pepsinogen A exhibits the most extensive polymorphism among aspartic proteinases which can be detected by either by protein electrophoresis or by DNA analysis. Southern blot hybridization with respective DNA probes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification have revealed nucleotide differences located within the coding and noncoding portions of the aspartic proteinase genes. These polymorphisms can be used to investigate potential roles of each proteinase in genetically influenced clinical conditions. The development of additional highly polymorphic markers detected by PCR amplification of divergent nucleotide sequence repeats will greatly assist with documentation of the effect of genetic variation of the aspartic proteinases may have in specific clinical diseases such as ulcer and hypertension.

17123534|t|Mapping of the complement C9 binding domain in paramyosin of the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni.
17123534|a|Schistosomes are believed to evade complement-mediated damage by expression of complement inhibitory proteins. Our previous results [Deng, J., Gold, D., LoVerde, P.T., Fishelson, Z., 2003. Inhibition of the complement membrane attack complex by Schistosoma mansoni paramyosin. Infect. Immun. 71, 6402-6410.] have demonstrated that paramyosin (Pmy) of the blood fluke S. mansoni binds to the human complement proteins C8 and C9, inhibits complement activation at the terminal stage and protects the parasite from complement-mediated damage. In order to locate the Pmy binding site to C8 and C9, various fragments of Pmy cDNA were PCR-cloned into a pET28a bacterial expression vector. Recombinant His-tagged Pmy fragments were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Binding assays by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-His antibody demonstrated that PmyCC (Pmy amino acids (744)Asp-(866)Met) was the only Pmy fragment that bound to human C8 and C9. Functional analyses demonstrated that PmyCC inhibited hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes and of antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes by human complement. Importantly, PmyCC inhibited in vitro killing of trypsin-sensitized schistosomula of S. mansoni by human complement. In the presence of PmyCC, Zn(2+)-induced C9 polymerization was inhibited. Most of the immunodominant B-cell antigenic epitopes of Pmy are present in the PmyCC region, as antibodies collected from mice immunized with recombinant Pmy bound primarily to PmyCC. Taken together, this study has mapped the complement regulatory domain in Pmy, capable of binding to C8 and C9 and preventing polyC9 formation, to its C-terminal region.

3487774|t|A joining-diversity-joining complex generated by inversion mechanism and a variable-diversity complex in the beta-chain gene of the human T-cell receptor.
3487774|a|We have analysed an inactive allele of the beta-chain gene of the T-cell receptor in a human T-cell line HPB-ALL. Comparison with germline sequences showed that HPB-ALL has a joining (J)-diversity (D)-J complex recombined in head-to-head configuration and a variable (V)-D complex in tail-to-tail configuration. These results demonstrate that the inversion mechanism functions in the beta-chain gene of the T-cell receptor. The presence of the V-D complex suggests that V-D recombination could occur prior to D-J recombination although there is no definite proof that the V-D complex is an intermediate to form the V-D-J complex.

2109948|t|Antibody response to Schistosoma mansoni adult worm cysteine proteinases in infected individuals.
2109948|a|Antigens of the Schistosoma mansoni digestive tract are recognized early in the infective process. Two immunogenic components of the excretory/secretory products are proteolytic enzymes that degrade host hemoglobin in the lumen of the parasite gut. These enzymes, CP1 and CP2, belong to the class of cysteine proteinases. In this study, a preparation containing both proteinases has been used to detect proteinase antibodies in the sera of individuals living in Burundi. Of 133 individuals tested, 92% were excreting schistosome eggs. All patients with documented infections had positive anti-proteinase IgG titers (mean = 1:614), while 82% had positive IgM titers (mean = 1:267). Six weeks following praziquantel treatment, patients were assessed for egg excretion and antibody titer. Anti-proteinase IgG titers were significantly lower (mean = 1:259) than pre-treatment titers. Patients who were infected with S. japonicum or S. haematobium typically showed a cross-reactive IgG response. Patients from non-endemic regions yielded negative titers, and those with non-trematode parasites were negative (79%) or weakly positive. S. mansoni cysteine proteinases may be used for the detection of schistosome infections.

17441253|t|Automatic determination of primary electron beam parameters in Monte Carlo simulation.
17441253|a|In order to obtain realistic and reliable Monte Carlo simulations of medical linac photon beams, an accurate determination of the parameters that define the primary electron beam that hits the target is a fundamental step. In this work we propose a new methodology to commission photon beams in Monte Carlo simulations that ensures the reproducibility of a wide range of clinically useful fields. For such purpose accelerated Monte Carlo simulations of 2 x 2, 10 x 10, and 20 x 20 cm2 fields at SSD = 100 cm are carried out for several combinations of the primary electron beam mean energy and radial FWHM. Then, by performing a simultaneous comparison with the correspondent measurements for these same fields, the best combination is selected. This methodology has been employed to determine the characteristics of the primary electron beams that best reproduce a Siemens PRIMUS and a Varian 2100 CD machine in the Monte Carlo simulations. Excellent agreements were obtained between simulations and measurements for a wide range of field sizes. Because precalculated profiles are stored in databases, the whole commissioning process can be fully automated, avoiding manual fine-tunings. These databases can also be used to characterize any accelerators of the same model from different sites.

15593464|t|Andrenocortical carcinomas: twelve-year prospective experience.
15593464|a|Adrenocortical carcinoma (AC) is a rare tumor with poor prognosis. Twenty-two patients (14 F, 8 M; age 22 to 59 years; median, 43 years) with AC were evaluated prospectively in a single center: tumor stage was I-II in 12 cases and III-IV in 10. The overall survival in our cohort was 41.6 +/- 42 months; 16 subjects are still alive. Curative surgery was followed by longer survival than debulking or no surgery (p < 0.0001). The first relapse was highly predictive for further recurrences. Recurrent ACs were progressively more aggressive, and they occurred with variable but ever shorter intervals. At diagnosis, 14 patients (63.5%) presented with features of clear adrenocortical hyperactivity. Despite the absence of clinical signs of hormonal excess, all other patients presented some abnormalities of steroid secretion. The most common clinical finding was a recent diagnosis of moderate-to-severe hypertension (68%), poorly controlled by pharmacological treatment, often associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. High mitotic rate and undifferentiated polymorph cellular pattern were associated with worse prognosis. Response to treatments other than surgery (mitotane chemotherapy) was better in patients treated early after the first surgery. In conclusion, curative surgery was the most effective treatment. Monitoring arterial pressure, endocrine parameters, and metabolic parameters can be helpful for the early detection of AC recurrences.

2716980|t|Anterior decompression and stabilization of the spine in malignant disease.
2716980|a|Evidence has accumulated that indicates that laminectomy with or without radiotherapy is not necessarily the best mode of treatment for all cases of spinal cord compression of malignant pathogenesis. Success is limited, and there is a high risk of adverse neurological developments, particularly where there is anterior vertebral collapse. A prospective series of 26 consecutive patients with neurological complications of neoplastic extradural cord compression is described. Anterior decompression followed by stabilization in a single stage procedure was selected as the most appropriate method of treatment for all 26 patients. Various techniques were used in the replacement of the excised vertebral body, including the use of two types of prosthesis created specifically for the purpose. Of the patients who were not ambulatory at the time of surgery, 62% became so postoperatively; 71% of those with intractable pain were pain free after surgery. The postoperative mortality rate was 30%, which reflected the poor condition of the patients; in light of this, the criteria for operative selection are reviewed. Neurological deterioration did not occur in any patient. The method is recommended, for selected patients, for the management of cord compression caused by collapse of the vertebral body. The patient's prospects of restored ability to walk after a single-stage operation are good, and the risk of adverse neurological effects is negligible.

8163031|t|Prenatal diagnosis of fetal urinary pathology with ultrasound.
8163031|a|Forty-six cases of fetal urinary malformations diagnosed by ultrasound are described. A reliable prenatal diagnosis is extremely important since it may offer options for pregnancy termination or may change obstetric management in the third trimester. Ultrasound criteria necessary for the diagnosis are: (i) bilateral multicystic kidneys, (ii) loss of renal architecture, (iii) non-visualization of the fetal bladder, (iv) absence of amniotic fluid, and (v) urinary dilatation. Thirty-six of the 46 cases of fetal urinary pathology had postnatal confirmation of the diagnosis. No false positive diagnosis was observed. All 19 fetuses with obstructive uropathy were observed for more than 3 weeks. Postnatal function was normal in 12 (63%) fetuses with obstructive uropathy. It is concluded that ultrasound is a valuable tool in the detection of fetal urinary pathology.

16958701|t|A comprehensive and critical review of dental implant placement in diabetic animals and patients.
16958701|a|OBJECTIVES: A thorough and exhaustive analysis of the available studies concerning placement of endosseous dental implants in diabetic subjects has not been previously published. The aim of the present study was to perform a comprehensive and critical review of experimental and clinical studies published in the international peer-reviewed literature in the English language regarding endosseous implant installation in diabetic subjects and to draw evidence-based conclusions on the effectiveness and predictability of dental implant therapy in diabetic patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature search for articles published up to and including March 2005 in the English language was performed with a personal computer (PC) using The National Library Of Medicine (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed) and Cochrane Oral Health Group databases. Search strategy included a specific series of terms and key words. The reference lists of identified publications, relevant texts and previous workshops were also scanned. Data sources also included several hand-searched journals and contact with experts, when it was considered appropriate. Search was conducted independently by the three reviewers (S. K., I. K. K., I. F.). At the first phase of selection the titles and abstracts and at the second phase full papers were screened independently by the three reviewers. Disagreement regarding inclusion of full papers was resolved by discussion among the reviewers. RESULTS: The search provided 227 potentially relevant titles and abstracts. At the first phase of evaluation, 199 publications were rejected based on title and abstract. At the second phase, the full text of the remaining 28 publications was retrieved for more detailed evaluation. These publications included 11 experimental studies and 16 clinical studies (one clinical study corresponded to two publications). Finally, 11 experimental and eight clinical studies were accepted. Clinical studies included four prospective and four retrospective studies. Because of the limited number of available studies and their heterogeneity, focusing on a specific predefined question to be answered by a systematic review was not feasible and therefore no meta-analysis was planned. CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the existing investigations, experimental studies seem to reveal an impaired bone healing response to implant placement in diabetic animals compared with non-diabetic controls, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The majority of clinical studies tend to indicate that diabetes is no contraindication for implant placement, on condition that it remains under metabolic control. However, definitive guidelines with objective criteria, such as type and duration of diabetes and glucosylated hemoglobin levels, need to be established in the future.

3433014|t|Increased susceptibility to liver disease in relation to alcohol consumption in women.
3433014|a|Sex-related differences were prospectively studied in patients with the first presentation of alcoholic liver disease. Among 42 patients the diagnosis was cirrhosis in 8 women and 15 men, alcoholic hepatitis in 4 women and 1 man, steatosis in 6 women and 6 men, and no histologic changes were found in the liver biopsy specimens from 2 men (p greater than 0.1). The median (range) antipyrine clearance was 14.6 (1.0-64) versus 17.2 (3.0-83) ml/min and the clinical score in accordance with the Pugh modification of the Child-Turcotte classification was 8 (5-13) versus 8 (5-11) in the women and men, respectively (p greater than 0.05). In 5 women and only 1 man the antipyrine clearance was less than 5 ml/min, indicating an almost total loss of functional liver mass (p less than 0.05), whereas the Pugh score was above 11 in 6 women, but not in any of the men (p less than 0.05). On an average, the men estimated their total lifetime consumption of alcohol to be 2.1 times greater and the number of days they had consumed more than 5 drinks 2.9 times higher than the women (p less than 0.05). These ratios are reduced to 1.4 and 1.7, respectively (p greater than 0.05), if the female alcohol intake is adjusted to the average male volume of distribution. The results support the concept that women may develop similar, and sometimes even more severe, liver disease after consumption of less alcohol than men. The apparent difference in susceptibility to alcohol may be partly explained by differences in volume of distribution.

18835290|t|Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by pancreatic and crotalic (Crotalus durissus terrificus) phospholipases A2 on rabbit proximal tubules suspensions.
18835290|a|In the present study we show that phospholipases A2 isolated from porcine pancreas (PP-PLA2) and Crotalus durissus terrificus snake venom (SV-PLA2) induced dose-dependent increases of LDH release from rabbit proximal tubules in suspension. Both porcine and crotalic PLA(2)s induced increases in non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels (microg of NEFA/mg of tubule protein). It was observed that the NEFA levels in the pellets were higher than in the supernatant for both PLA2, and were dose-dependent for the crotalic PLA2 group. Furthermore, snake venom PLA2 induced a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) assessed by both JC-1 uptake and safranin O uptake. Porcine PLA2 produced no effects on JC-1 uptake with the highest concentrations and an unexpected increase in the group treated with the lowest concentration. In contrast, the safranin O method revealed decreases of energization with both phospholipases, so it had higher sensitivity to the presence of the increased NEFA levels. Addition of delipidated bovine serum albumin (dBSA) completely reversed the effects induced by phospholipases on DeltaPsi(m) measured with safranin O. Incubation with pancreatic and crotalic phospholipases A2 produced no changes on cell ATP levels. We conclude that the treatment of proximal tubule suspensions with porcine or crotalic phospholipases disturbed membrane integrity as well as mitochondrial function. Specific early NEFA-mediated mitochondrial effects of the phospholipases used in the present study are indicated by the benefit provided by dBSA.

17167171|t|Thiazolidinedione class of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists prevents neuronal damage, motor dysfunction, myelin loss, neuropathic pain, and inflammation after spinal cord injury in adult rats.
17167171|a|Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are potent synthetic agonists of the ligand-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). TZDs were shown to induce neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia by blocking inflammation. As spinal cord injury (SCI) induces massive inflammation that precipitates secondary neuronal death, we currently analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of TZDs pioglitazone and rosiglitazone after SCI in adult rats. Both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone (1.5 mg/kg i.p.; four doses at 5 min and 12, 24, and 48 h) significantly decreased the lesion size (by 57 to 68%, p < 0.05), motor neuron loss (by 3- to 10-fold, p < 0.05), myelin loss (by 66 to 75%, p < 0.05), astrogliosis (by 46 to 61%, p < 0.05), and microglial activation (by 59 to 78%, p < 0.05) after SCI. TZDs significantly enhanced the motor function recovery (at 7 days after SCI, the motor scores were 37 to 45% higher in the TZD groups over the vehicle group; p < 0.05), but the treatment was effective only when the first injection was given by 2 h after SCI. At 28 days after SCI, chronic thermal hyperalgesia was decreased significantly (by 31 to 39%; p < 0.05) in the pioglitazone group compared with the vehicle group. At 6 h after SCI, the pioglitazone group showed significantly less induction of inflammatory genes [interleukin (IL)-6 by 83%, IL-1beta by 87%, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by 75%, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 by 84%, and early growth response-1 by 67%] compared with the vehicle group (p < 0.05 in all cases). Pioglitazone also significantly enhanced the post-SCI induction of neuroprotective heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes. Pretreatment with a PPARgamma antagonist, 2-chloro-5-nitro-N-phenyl-benzamide (GW9662), prevented the neuroprotection induced by pioglitazone.

11280757|t|4-Demethoxy-3'-deamino-3'-aziridinyl-4'-methylsulphonyl-daunorubicin (PNU-159548), a novel anticancer agent active against tumor cell lines with different resistance mechanisms.
11280757|a|The activity of 4-demethoxy-3'-deamino-3'-aziridinyl-4'-methylsulphonyl-daunorubicin (PNU-159548), a new alkycycline with high antitumor activity against a broad range of cancer cells, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in cells selected for resistance to different anticancer agents. Both in vitro and in vivo, PNU-159548 did retain its activity in cells expressing the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, associated to MIDR-1 gene overexpression or with an alteration in the topoisomerase II gene (altered MDR), independently on the drug used for the selection of the resistant cell line. According to these data, the intracellular uptake of PNU-159548 is not influenced by the presence of MDR-1. PNU-159548 was also active, both in vitro and in vivo, against cells showing resistance to various alkylating agents iincluding cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan) and topoisomerase I-inhibitors. Cells defective in nucleotide excision repair, which did show hypersensitivity to treatment with UV irradiation and alkylating agents, showed only a marginally increased sensitivity to PNU-159548. Similarly, the activity of the drug was not influenced by the mismatch repair system, as assessed in two different cellular systems deficient in hMLH1 expression and in which hMLH1 activity was restored by chromosome 3 transfer. The results obtained clearly indicate that the new anticancer agent PNU-159548 is able to overcome the classical mechanisms of resistance emerging after treatment with the most clinically used anticancer agents, and it could represent an alternate choice in the treatment of those tumors refractory to conventional therapy.

8292501|t|Intracellular magnesium and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor: molecular mechanisms of interaction, physiology and pharmacology.
8292501|a|This review focuses on the action of intracellular magnesium ion on the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor, the almost ubiquitous membrane-bound Ca2+ channel gated by the intracellular second messenger IP3. Experimental data have shown that Mg2+ is a non-competitive inhibitor of the IP3-gated Ca2+ channel and of [3H]-IP3 binding. The relevance of the Mg2+ effect is discussed in relation to: (a) the physiological role of the IP3-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores, i.e., Ca2+ homeostasis of activated cells, in particular cardiac myocytes; (b) the modulation exerted by changes of [Mg2+]o and [Mg2+]i on basic cardiac functions, e.g., inotropism, chronotropism and automaticity; and (c) the pathogenesis of automatic arrhythmias, caused by either early or delayed afterdepolarizations, in which IP3-induced release of Ca2+ may be involved.

12553753|t|Effect of dextran as a run buffer additive in drug-protein binding studies using capillary electrophoresis frontal analysis.
12553753|a|The study of drug-protein interactions by capillary electrophoresis frontal analysis requires establishment of a sufficient mobility difference between the mobility of the ligand and protein. The potential utility of dextran as a run buffer additive to manipulate the electrophoretic mobilities of low molecular weight ligands and protein in capillary electrophoresis frontal analysis binding studies was assessed. It was demonstrated that dextran was effective in improving the separation between the ligands warfarin and flurbiprofen and human serum albumin. Separation of ligand and protein increased with the concentration of added dextran (0-7.5% (w/w)), while molecular weight of the additive (70,000-2,000,000) only had a minor effect. The effect of dextran addition on viscosity and electrophoretic and electroosmotic mobilites was systematically studied. Optimal frontal analysis settings were a compromise between achieving satisfactory separation and acceptable analysis times without loss of plateau peak conditions. No effect of dextran upon the drug-human serum albumin interactions could be detected for the model ligands. Introduction of dextran into the electrophoresis buffer expands the applicability of capillary electrophoresis frontal analysis in drug research to binding interactions between proteins and low molecular weight ligands possessing similar electrophoretic mobilities.

8821194|t|Erythropoietin and cardiovascular risk.
8821194|a|We studied the changes in some cardiovascular risk (CVR) factors in 24 maintenance hemodialysis patients treated for 1 year with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) either intravenously (12 cases) or subcutaneously (12 cases). In order to clarify whether changes in some parameters were due to direct action of rHuEPO or to changes in food intake, we divided the patients into two groups: group A was formed by 14 patients who showed an increase in their food intake during rHuEPO therapy and group B by 10 patients without or with slight changes in their food intake. rHuEPO induced an improvement in well-being in 20 of 24 patients and in physical working capacity in 14 of 24, an increase in mean blood pressure in all patients, and hypertension in 4 of 24 patients. The incidence of hypertension was slightly higher after intravenous (3/12) than after subcutaneous (1/12) treatment. The rate of dialysis treatment with symptomatic hypertension significantly decreased from 44.0 +/- 8.0 to 12.1 +/- 2.2% after intravenous and from 41.3 +/- 6.8 to 10.0 +/- 3.8% after subcutaneous treatment. Evaluation of glucose metabolism (intravenous glucose tolerance test) before and after 3 months of rHuEPO therapy showed an improvement in glucose utilization (insulin resistance reduction). Cholesterol (CH), low-density lipoprotein CH, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B significantly increased in group A, but not in group B. Both in groups A and B, high-density lipoprotein CH significantly decreased during the first 6 months and returned to basal values during the following months, and the apolipoprotein A1 level significantly decreased during the first 4 months and increased to levels higher than basal values during the following months. Changes in CH and apolipoprotein B were also positively correlated with changes in the protein catabolic rate. We infer that rHuEPO has opposite effects on CVR, but subcutaneous administration, dietary control, and antihypertensive treatment may produce a net decrease in CVR of maintenance hemodialysis patients on rHuEPO therapy.

10518845|t|Study designs and challenges in clinical studies conducted in infants and children with asthma.
10518845|a|Because of the challenges associated with conducting clinical trials in pediatric patients, most drugs have not been adequately tested in this patient population. Insufficient testing frequently results in product labeling that fails to provide instructions for safe and effective use in pediatric patients. The most prevalent chronic disease in children is asthma; however, very few asthma medications have been evaluated in infants and young children. Budesonide inhalation suspension is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid administered by nebulization that requires only passive inhalation and is therefore suitable for infants and young children who are unable to use currently available inhalation devices for the administration of asthma medications. The efficacy of budesonide inhalation suspension was evaluated in 3 US clinical trials. All 3 trials were randomized, controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies in children (6 months-8 years of age) with a primary diagnosis of chronic persistent asthma. Symptom assessments conducted in both the morning and evening were the primary efficacy variables. Although the children were young, secondary efficacy evaluations included spirometry and peak expiratory flow collected in both the morning and evening (in a subset of patients capable of performing these maneuvers). Patients who completed or were discontinued from the 12-week double-blind treatment phase were eligible to enter 52-week, open-label extension studies. The design of these 3 studies confirms the feasibility of the performance of placebo-controlled clinical trials of asthma medications in pediatric patients and allows for efficacy evaluations based on symptom assessments together with pulmonary function testing.

1944184|a|It has been made by a number of studies that after hepatic resection, portal factors such as insulin and glucagon play an important role in liver regeneration. We have reported hypertrophy of Langerhans islands of dogs after partial hepatectomy. In the present study we attempted to clarify the mechanism of this hypertrophy. In a control group, a forty-percent hepatectomy was carried out. One and four weeks after surgery, 0.5g/kg of glucose was administered intravenously followed by a blood sampling from the portal vein to measure the changes of glucose, insulin and glucagon respectively. In addition area changes of the islets of Langerhans after the operation were measured with PAP technique. In a GI group, the same experiment as in the control group was done and 1mg of glucagon and 2IU/kg of insulin were administered every morning after the operation. The following results were obtained. In the GI group, there were no decrease in portal plasma insulin level and no enlargement of the sizes of the islets four weeks after surgery.

11055623|t|Age at menarche and tanner stage in girls exposed in utero and postnatally to polybrominated biphenyl.
11055623|a|Accidental contamination of the Michigan food chain with polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) led to the exposure of more than 4,000 individuals in 1973. Because PBB exposure is suspected to disrupt endocrine function, we assessed pubertal development in females 5-24 years of age (N = 327) who were exposed to PBB in utero and, in many cases, through breastfeeding. We estimated in utero PBB exposure using maternal serum PBB measurements taken after exposure (1976-1979) and extrapolated to time of pregnancy using a model of PBB decay. We found that breastfed girls exposed to high levels of PBB in utero (> or =7 parts per billion) had an earlier age at menarche (mean age = 11.6 years) than breastfed girls exposed to lower levels of PBB in utero (mean age = 12.2-12.6 years) or girls who were not breastfed (mean age = 12.7 years). This association persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (menarche ratio = 3.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.3-9.0). Perinatal PBB exposure was associated with earlier pubic hair stage in breastfed girls, but little association was found with breast development. The associations observed here lend support to the hypothesis that pubertal events may be affected by pre- and postnatal exposure to organohalogens.

Due to favourable referral and treatment patterns in the Munich area, we could provide confident data from dystonia patients seeking botulinum toxin treatment. A total of 230 patients were ascertained, of whom 188 had primary dystonia. Point prevalence ratios were estimated to be 10.1 (95% confidence interval 8.4-11.9) per 100,000 for focal and 0.3 (0.0-0.6) for generalised primary dystonia. The most common focal primary dystonias were cervical dystonia with 5.4 (4.2-6.7) and essential blepharospasm with 3.1 (2.1-4.1) per 100,000 followed by laryngeal dystonia (spasmodic dysphonia) with 1.0 (0.4-1.5) per 100,000.

7585472|t|Loss of heterozygosity at 9p and 17q in human laryngeal tumors.
7585472|a|Recent investigations revealed that the 9p arm and 17q arm of human chromosomes harbour tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) with an important role in multistage carcinogenesis. At the 9p arm is located the p16 (MTS1) TSG and probably others with an effect on various human tumours such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, bladder cancer, gliomas, malignant mesotheliomas, melanomas and non-small cell lung carcinomas. In addition, the 17q arm harbours BRCA1 TSG which is responsible for approximately 80% of the familial breast/ovarian cancer cases. In order to investigate the implication of these performed a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis with 10 polymorphic microsatellite markers (three at the 17q arm surrounding the BRCA1 region and seven at the 9p arm). Fourteen of the 17 (82%) tumours exhibited deletions at 9p. The highest incidence of LOH (6/13, 46%) was found for the marker D9S157 at 9p22. One sample exhibited deletion of all the informative markers tested indicating deletion of the complete 9p arm. No homozygous deletions were found. LOH at the 17q arm near the BRCA1 locus was found in 6 (35%) among 17 specimens. The results of this study indicate that allelic deletions at 9p are frequent in the development of laryngeal tumours. The highest incidence of LOH was found for the marker D9S157 which is near, but distinct from the location of p16 (MTS1) tumour suppressor gene, indicating the presence of multiple tumour suppressor genes within this chromosomal region. In addition, BRCA1 TSG is implicated in the development of laryngeal tumours.

6169524|a|Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) RNA is transcribed in vitro by reverse transcriptase into complementary DNA in the presence of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides as primers. In the case of priming with the pentadecadeoxyribonucleotide d(T-T-C-T-T-T-T-T-T-C-T-T-T-T-C) complementary to PSTV RNA from nucleotides 49 to 63, specificity of transcription initiation allows rapid sequencing of part of the viroid genome using chain-terminating dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The DNA transcripts obtained represent distinct molecular species with the largest product being a full-length copy of the viroid RNA template. Molecular hybridization with 32P-labeled complementary DNA detects sequence homologies among different viroid species.

2663622|a|Case history of a patient is reported who developed signs of preeclampsia in 28th week of her first gravidity. Within one day severe haemolysis and diffuse haemorrhage occurred and an emergency section was performed. Subsequently, supported respiration became necessary because of diffuse infiltrations of the lung. Laboratory data then were conclusive for a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (Moschcowitz's disease) and therefore the patient was subjected to plasma exchange during seven days: this measure induced rapid and full clinical and laboratory remission. The case history is discussed on the background of the pertinent literature and the special perspective of a pathophysiological identity between the two syndromes: HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) and Moschcowitz's disease (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura); this seems to be of special interest for an adequate therapy by plasma exchange.

242085|t|Orthotopic liver transplantation after preservation without perfusion for up to six hours: A controlled trial evaluating different preservation fluids in dogs and pigs.
242085|a|The important extension of the ischemic period recently described with a simple hypothermic liver preservation method is attributed to the use of specific preservation fluids. However, there is no consensus about the optimal preservation fluid. In order to investigate the effect of the composition of the preservation fluid on the immediately postoperative transplant function and on subsequent long-term survival, orthotopic liver transplantations were performed in 13 dogs and 12 pigs. To reduce immunologic interference in postoperative transplant evaluation, donor and recipient pairs always were litter mates, the dogs being identical according to lymphocyte typing. The ischemic periods were 1, 3, and 6 hours. Four different preservation fluids were used with marked differences in ionic composition (extracellular vs. intracellular), pH, and osmolarity. Within each ischemic period group the sequence of experiments was randomized with respect to the different preservation fluids. Twenty-four animals survived the transplantation procedure. No differences were found between the preservation fluid groups. Postoperative function of all livers preserved for 6 hours was comparable to those with 1 hour ischemia. Three dogs and four pigs (six of seven with livers preserved for 3 to 6 hours) are still alive more than 1 year after transplantation. So consistently excellent liver function leading to long-term survival in 36 percent of cases can be obtained after liver transplantation with preservation up to 6 hours; for this result the composition of the preservation fluid is of minor importance.

12398419|a|A mathematical model for epicardial radiofrequency ablation using an electrode irrigated by saline is proposed. Saline flow profiles are derived using thin film theory, and heat convection due to blood flow is also included in the model. Results from a computer implementation of the model using a finite element method suggest that transmural ablation lesions can be made in 4-mm-thick tissue. Effects of parameters such as tissue and saline layer thickness, irrigation rate, blood flow rate, and applied power are investigated. Saline is found to irrigate as well as ablate. Rise in saline temperature and consequent ablation by saline is more pronounced as saline layer becomes thicker. Electrode tip temperatures as much as 40 degrees C lower than maximum tissue temperature were found in simulations.

14985974|t|General and specific combining ability from partial diallels of radiata pine: implications for utility of SCA in breeding and deployment populations.
14985974|a|Variances for general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) and the relationship between mid-parental GCA and SCA effects were estimated for tree diameter (DBH) from a series of 20 sets of 6x6 half-diallel mating experiments in radiata pine, planted at ten sites across Australia. Significant SCA variance for DBH was almost equal to GCA variance for the combined analysis of all ten sites. The importance of SCA variance varied among sites, from non-significant to SCA variance accounting for all genetic variation among full-sib families. Significant SCA x site interaction was detected among the ten sites. A significant and positive correlation between mid-parental breeding values and best linear unbiased predictions of the SCA effects was observed. About a quarter of extra genetic gain is achievable through use of SCA variance if selection is based on the best breeding values. To fully exploit genetic gain from SCA variance in a deployment population, positive assortative matings are required for the best parents. It is estimated that the additional deployment gain of 46.0% for ten sites combined, or 52.9% for four sites combined that had significant GCA as well as SCA effects, were achievable relative to gain from GCA only, if all SCA variance within this breeding population was exploited. For a breeding population, selection for breeding values may be sufficient due to positive correlations between breeding values and SCA values. For a deployment population to capture more SCA genetic gain, it is preferable to make more pair-wise mating for parents with higher breeding values.

2549968|t|Proteolytic processing of a coleopteran-specific delta-endotoxin produced by Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis.
2549968|a|Insecticidal protein delta-endotoxin crystals harvested from sporulated cultures of Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis contain a major polypeptide of 67 kDa and minor polypeptides of 73, 72, 55 and 46 kDa. During sporulation, only the 73 kDa polypeptide could be detected at stage I. The 67 kDa polypeptide was first detected at stage II and increased in concentration throughout the later stages of sporulation and after crystal release, with a concomitant decrease in the 73 kDa polypeptide. This change could be blocked by the addition of proteinase inhibitors. Trypsin or insect-gut-extract treatment of the delta-endotoxin crystals after solubilization resulted in a cleavage product of 55 kDa with asparagine-159 of the deduced amino acid sequence of the toxin [Hofte, Seurinck, van Houtven & Vaeck (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15, 71-83; Sekar, Thompson, Maroney, Bookland & Adang (1987) Proc.

7722302|t|Differential expression of endoglin on fetal and adult hematopoietic cells in human bone marrow.
7722302|a|Endoglin, a glycoprotein that is expressed by human endothelial cells, binds TGF-beta 1 and -beta 3 with high affinity. It was originally identified with the 44G4 mAb that was produced against a human pre-B cell line. We now report that another anti-pre-B cell mAb, 29-G8, reacts with pro-B and pre-B leukemic cells, but not with mature B and T cells, and recognizes a different epitope of endoglin. The 29-G8 mAb bound specifically to recombinant endoglin and immunoprecipitated a phosphorylated homodimeric glycoprotein with subunits of M(r) 95,000 from the 697 pre-B cell line. This new Ab removed all of the molecules identified by the prototypic 44G4 anti-endoglin Ab, but the reverse was not true. A subpopulation of 29-G8+ endoglin molecules on this pre-B cell line was unreactive with the 44G4 mAb, thus suggesting that these anti-endoglin Abs see different epitopes that may discriminate different species of endoglin molecules. Flow cytometric analysis with the 29-G8 mAb revealed two endoglin-positive subpopulations in fetal bone marrow: early B-lineage precursor cells (CD19+ and CD34+), and proerythroblasts (CD71+ and glycophorin A+). In adult bone marrow, only the proerythroblast subpopulation was observed. Stromal cells derived from fetal bone marrow also reacted strongly with the 29-G8 and 44G4 Abs, and these cells responded with enhanced proliferation after stimulation with either TGF-beta 1 or the anti-endoglin Abs. Thus, endoglin, a specialized component of the TGF-beta receptor system, may play a physiologic role in the stromal-hemopoietic cell interactions occurring during development.

10437614|t|Primary liver disease as a determinant for acute rejection after liver transplantation.
10437614|a|BACKGROUND: Graft rejection and infection remain major problems following liver transplantation; both are heavily influenced by the immunosuppressive regimen. Despite the disparity in the primary disease leading to transplantation, all patients receive the same posttransplant immunosuppressive treatment in a given center. The aim of this study is to detect a possible effect of the underlying disease on the incidence of early acute rejection episodes after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis on all 101 consecutive liver transplants performed in 95 patients between 1983 and March 1998; five of these patients, surviving less than 30 days, were not included. The immunosuppressive regimen was based on conventional triple therapy during the whole study period. The diagnosis and treatment of acute rejection within the first 30 days post-OLT was uniform throughout the whole study period. RESULTS: Though there were no differences with respect to patients' characteristics [age, child classification, number of HLA-mismatches or cytomegalovirus (CMV)-serocompatibility], patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) showed a significant increase of acute rejection after OLT compared with the other patients transplanted for other liver diseases (P = 0.024). The incidence of infection was not elevated in patients transplanted for PBC when compared with other diagnoses. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that primary liver disease may be a determinant for acute graft rejection in PBC. Furthermore, these results suggest that immunosuppressive regimens based on the underlying disease should be considered.

11122310|t|Are diabetic patients in danger at renal transplantation? An invasive perioperative study.
11122310|a|It is assumed that diabetic patients with uraemia have more complications at renal transplantation than those who are not diabetic. We compared the preoperative ECGs, and invasive perioperative haemodynamic and oxygenation parameters in 15 diabetic and 15 non-diabetic uraemic patients undergoing renal transplantation. The number of patients with increased QT dispersion in the ECG was higher in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients (P<0.05). Before anaesthesia, heart rate and mean arterial pressure were higher (P<0.05) in the diabetic than in the non-diabetic group. After preanaesthetic volume loading all patients showed a hyperdynamic circulation, which subsided during anaesthesia. However, stroke volume index remained unchanged. Four patients in the diabetic group and six in the non-diabetic group needed additional oxygen therapy after surgery. No cardiac dysrhythmias were noted. However, the increased QT dispersion in diabetic patients calls for an adequate perioperative ECG monitoring for dysrhythmias. The diabetic and non-diabetic uraemic patients performed equally well at renal transplantation. In conclusion, renal transplantation for diabetics is justified.

566785|t|Changes in rat pancreatic protein synthesis after a single feeding with diets containing raw or heated soybeans.
566785|a|The patterns of protein synthesis following the administration of a single meal containing defatted ground soybeans (RSD) or heated defatted ground soybeans (HSD) were compared. A double label method was used so that the determination of the relative rate of synthesis of an enzyme could not be obscured by a possible alteration of the activity or quantity of the enzyme. Rats were given one meal of RSD or HSD and were subsequently killed at different times after the meal. Eight hours after the meal, the relative rate of synthesis of one of the three trypsinogens was substantially increased with RSD feeding, whereas that of the amylases and one chymotrypsinogen were somewhat lower. The synthetic rate of lipase, ribonclease, proelastase, another chymotrypsinogen and of two trypsinogens was unaffected when feeding RSD is compared to feeding HSD. The relative rate of synthesis of one of the trypsinogens was unaffected 8 hours after RSD feeding, but was increased 16 hours after RSD feeding. Actinomycin D could suppress the effects of RSD feeding on the protein synthetic rate of some, but not of all, secretory proteins.

18471451|t|Impact of home warfarin use on the treatment and outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.
18471451|a|The periprocedural management, bleeding risks, and outcomes of patients taking warfarin previous to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have not been well characterized. All patients undergoing PCI in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry from January 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006 were analyzed (n = 307,443). Multivariable modeling was used to evaluate the association between home warfarin use and in-hospital mortality and bleeding (requiring blood transfusion and/or prolonging hospital stay and/or causing hemoglobin drop >3.0 g/dl). Patients undergoing elective PCI and urgent PCI (primary/rescue/facilitated PCI with symptoms fewer than 24 hours) were analyzed separately. Overall, 11,173 patients (3.6%) were taking warfarin previous to PCI. Compared with patients not taking warfarin, patients taking warfarin were older and had greater burden of comorbidities. Patients taking warfarin were less likely to receive aspirin, theinopyridines, and glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonists during PCI. Unadjusted bleeding rates (elective PCI = 3.2% vs 1.9%; urgent PCI = 8.2% vs 4.8%) and in-hospital mortality (elective PCI = 1.4% vs. 0.6%; urgent PCI = 8.6% vs. 4.5%) were higher among patients taking warfarin. After adjustment for clinical characteristics, the risk of in-hospital mortality was similar with and without previous warfarin use. However, the adjusted risk of bleeding was significantly higher in patients receiving warfarin, for both elective (odds ratio = 1.26, 95% confidence interval = 1.09 to 1.46) and urgent PCI (odds ratio = 1.42, 95% confidence interval = 1.14 to 1.76). In conclusion, while fewer than 5% of patients undergoing PCI are taking previous warfarin, these patients have a higher risk of in-hospital bleeding events but a similar risk of mortality despite lower use of antiplatelet agents.

9050232|t|The key role of the H+ V-ATPase in acid-base balance and Na+ transport processes in frog skin.
9050232|a|Frogs are faced with various osmoregulatory problems, such as compensation of salt and water loss or metabolic acidification. Being exposed both to air and to pond water of low salinity in their natural habitat, the epithelium of the frog skin serves as one of the major organs for body fluid homeostasis. For years, the frog skin has been the guiding model for ion transport processes in animal cells energized by a Na(+)-motive force. Meanwhile, however, it was demonstrated that under natural conditions Na+ uptake is electrically coupled to active H+ secretion, mediated by an electrogenic H+ pump. A proton-motive force generated at the apical membrane of the mitochondria-rich cells (MR cells) energizes Na+ entry via apical Na+ channels. The basolateral Na+/K+ P-ATPase then pumps Na+ out of the cell into the body fluid. Thus, there are two pumps functioning in series, both involved in transepithelial Na+ transport. Our recent investigations provided conclusive evidence that the H+ pump of the frog skin is an H+ V-ATPase. In transport studies, Na+ absorption and H+ secretion were blocked by micromolar concentrations of bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin A, two highly specific inhibitors of H(+)-V-ATPases. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, H(+)-V-ATPase-like immunoreactivity was found in MR cells in the region of their apical membrane foldings and intracellularly in the apical portion of the cell at so far unidentified locations. Besides the definition of its molecular nature, these results also confirmed the localization of the H+ pump in the apical membrane of the MR cells. These cells were already candidates for H(+)-V-ATPase localization mostly from correlations between their morphological features and their epithelial H+ secretion capacity. So far, there is evidence for only one type of MR cell serving both H+ and HCO3- secretion through an apical Cl-/HCO3- antiporter. H(+)-V-ATPase-mediated H+ secretion and thus Na+ absorption can be modulated by complementary mechanisms. Changes in intracellular H+ concentration linked to the animal's acid-base status will directly influence H+ V-ATPase activity. Acute acidification increases H+ current, probably as a result of the insertion of H(+)-V-ATPase-bearing vesicles by exocytotic processes, while alkalization causes the reverse effects. Chronic metabolic acidosis induces an increase in MR cell number in response to hormonal signals.

15083726|t|Influence of variations in methodology on populations of Listeria monocytogenes recovered from lettuce treated with sanitizers.
15083726|a|The elimination of Listeria monocytogenes inoculated onto a piece of cut iceberg lettuce (3.8 by 3.8 cm) by treatment with chlorinated water (200 micrograms/ml free chlorine) and a 0.5% (wt/vol) solution of FIT Professional Line Antibacterial Cleaner (FIT) was investigated. The efficacy of the two sanitizers was not influenced by the composition of the medium used to culture the L. monocytogenes used in the inocula, the number of strains in the inoculum, or the recovery medium used to enumerate the pathogen on lettuce after treatment. Drying inoculum on lettuce for 45 min at 37 degrees C caused more cells to die or not be retrieved compared with drying inoculum for 30 min at 25 degrees C. However, the percentage of cells in the inoculum recovered from lettuce treated with chlorine or FIT was not significantly different, regardless of the drying method. Stomaching, homogenizing, or stomaching followed by homogenizing lettuce treated with sanitizers resulted in recovery of similar numbers of L. monocytogenes, indicating that stomaching and homogenizing are equivalent in extracting cells; the sequential use of both processing methods did not substantially increase the efficiency of recovery. Washing lettuce with water or treating lettuce with 200 micrograms/ml chlorine or FIT resulted in decreases in populations of 0.60, 1.76, and 1.51 log CFU per lettuce piece, respectively, regardless of variations in test parameters. Reductions caused by sanitizers were significantly greater (alpha = 0.05) than that observed for water but not significantly different from each other. It is concluded that evaluation of sanitizers for their efficacy in killing L. monocytogenes on lettuce can be determined by spot inoculating 50 microliters of a five-strain mixture of cells from 24-h cultures suspended in 5% horse serum albumen, followed by drying the inoculum for 45 min at 37 degrees C, treatment by submerging in 50 ml of sanitizer for 5 min, stomaching samples in 50 ml of Dey-Engley neutralizing broth for 2 min, and enumerating survivors on modified Oxford medium.

8547150|t|Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa autoantigenic repertoire in chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
8547150|a|The objective of the present study was to further disclose the autoantigenic repertoire carried by the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa complex. IgG-F(ab')2 fragments were prepared from two prototype ITP patients, and their ability to block the binding of GPIIb/IIIa reactive antibodies derived from other patients with ITP was evaluated using a modified MAIPA asay; a PlA1 alloantiserum and 20 normal sera were included as controls. It was found that the two prototype IgG-F(ab')2 fragments were each able to significantly block the binding of serum IgG to GPIIb/IIa in six (55%) and seven (64%) out of 11 patients with chronic ITP, respectively. No significant blocking effect was observed for IgG-F(ab')2 fragments prepared from normal subjects. Also, the binding of the PlA1 alloantiserum to its epitope on GPIIIa was not affected by any of the blocking IgG-F(ab')2 fragments exploited in the study. These data substantiate that in chronic ITP at least half of the GPIIb/IIIa reactive sera bind to homogenous autoepitopes.

2939289|t|The influence of dietary copper on reproduction, growth and the cardiovascular system in Swiss-Webster female mice.
2939289|a|One hundred forty pubertal Swiss-Webster female mice (Mus musculus) were assigned randomly to a purified diet modified to contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 ppm copper as copper carbonate (Diets 1 thru 6, respectively). Diet 7 was a commercial rodent laboratory diet containing 11 ppm copper. Following 60 days of prefeeding, the breeding regimen was initiated by introducing a proven breeder male into each cage of 10 females in the afternoon and removing them the next morning. The breeding regimen was conducted for 28 days and females were either sacrificed at 24 or 96 hours following detection of a vaginal plug. Body weight, hematocrit, heart weight, hemoglobin concentration, ova recovery rate and fertilization rate were recorded for each female. All morphologically normal embryos collected 24 hours after detection of the vaginal plug were cultured and development in vitro evaluated. Body weight, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit were lower (P less than .05), and heart weight and percent body weight occupied by the heart (%BWOH) were higher (P less than .05) in mice fed Diet 1. Heart weight and %BWOH were not different among mice fed Diets 2 thru 6 (P greater than .05). Ova recovery rate and fertilization rate were significantly reduced in mice maintained on Diet 1. The incidence of in vitro blastocyst formation was lower in embryos collected from females fed Diets 1 and 3 (P less than .05). Blastocyst hatching in vitro was not observed in embryos from females maintained on Diet 1, and was greater in embryos from females fed Diets 4, 5, and 7 (P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

4003047|t|Binocular interaction in the VEP to grating stimulation. I. Orientational effects.
4003047|a|The orientational effects of monocular stimulation with sinusoidal grating patterns were studied with transient VEP technique in 10 subjects with normal vision and binocular functions. No significant variation in amplitude with orientation was obtained. The latency for 45 degrees (oblique) orientation was slightly longer than the latency for other orientations. The orientational effects on binocular interaction in dichoptic stimulation were determined with sinusoidal grating patterns at a reversing rate of 1.9 and 2.1 Hz for each eye respectively. The binocular interaction was assessed as the binocular/monocular ratio of the VEP amplitude for each eye. There was a significantly reduced binocular interaction for dichoptically presented perpendicular gratings as compared to parallel gratings at the spatial frequencies of 2, 4 and 6 cycles/degree, when mean values of the whole group of subjects were statistically analysed. A broad orientation tuning of about 45 degree was found for the binocular interaction at 4 cycles/degree for the group as a whole, although tuning was hard to establish in the VEP of each individual. This compares well with other neurophysiological and electrophysiological data but is broader than the orientation tuning demonstrated psychophysically.

At the high concentration (1 ppb), most of the mortality occurred in the larvae, but at sublethal concentrations (for larvae) mortality also occurred in pupae and adults (incomplete eclosion). An EC10 (emulsifiable concentrate containing 10% active ingredient) formulation of novaluron was evaluated against Ae. aegypti in water-storage containers in the field in Thailand. Two tests at high (0.05 to 1 mg/L) and low (1 to 20 microg/L) concentrations were carried out in clay jars (200 L) and plastic pails (75 L). At high concentrations in clayjars, we obtained 86-96% inhibition of emergence (IE) for about 190 d, but the mortality declined at low concentrations after 190 d. At much lower concentrations, in jars and plastic pails in the second experiment, the IE was 80-100% for 2 mo. The highest concentrations of this series (10 microg/L in jars and 20 microg/L in pails) were active for 75 and 68 d respectively, losing efficacy by 82 d post-treatment. In the experiment using low concentrations, all treatments in jars and plastic pails failed to provide adequate control 90 d after treatment. These studies show that novaluron, even as EC10, has exceptional long-term activity against Ae. aegypti in water-storage containers, with higher concentrations yielding greater long-term control than low concentrations.

7271273|t|Plasma disappearance, urine excretion, and tissue distribution of ribavirin in rats and rhesus monkeys.
7271273|a|Ribavirin has been shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral. To study its tissue distribution and disappearance rate, a single dose of 10 mg/kg which contained 10 microCi of [14C]ribavirin was injected intravenously into rhesus monkeys and intramuscularly into monkeys and rats. Except for peak plasma concentrations and the initial phases of the plasma disappearance and urine excretion curves, no significant difference was observed between plasma, tissue, or urine values for intramuscularly or intravenously injected monkeys. Plasma disappearance curves were triphasic; plasma concentrations of ribavirin were similar for both monkeys and rats. Rats excreted ribavirin in the urine more rapidly and to a greater extent (82% excreted in 24 h) than did monkeys (60% excreted in 72 h). In the rat, only 3% of the injected [14C]ribavirin was detected in expired CO2. Therefore, for both species, urine was the major route for the elimination of labeled ribavirin and its metabolites from the body. In monkeys, the amount of parent drug in blood cells increased through 48 h and remained stable for 72 h, whereas in rats, ribavirin decreased at a rate similar to the plasma disappearance curve. Concentrations of ribavirin at 8 h were consistently higher in monkeys than in rats for all tissues except the brain. Thus, these differences in blood cellular components and organ content and in urine excretion suggested that there was greater tissue retention of ribavirin in monkeys than in rats.

3494375|t|Pursuit opposite to the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) during sinusoidal stimulation in humans.
3494375|a|Pursuit opposite to a simultaneously activated vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) was tested during passive sinusoidal body oscillations (0.1-1.0 Hz, amplitudes 10-80 degrees) about the vertical axis in 4 healthy humans, while subjects were asked to pursue a small target moving in phase with the rotating chair with about half its amplitude relative to the head and 1.5 times its amplitude with respect to space. The decrease in gain of the pursuit opposite to the VOR occurred at lower stimulus frequency, stimulus velocity and stimulus acceleration than pure visual pursuit when gain was calculated in relation to target motion in head coordinates. It resembles that of pure pursuit when calculated in relation to target motion in space (earth coordinates, sum of the displacements of the mirror image and of the chair) thus taking the oppositely directed VOR into account. The data fit the assumption of a linear interaction of the VOR (in counterphase) and pursuit.

17722549|t|Sustained release of acyclovir from nano-liposomes and nano-niosomes: an in vitro study.
17722549|a|The present study was designed to develop and compare acyclovir containing nano-vesicular liposomes and niosomes based on cholesterol, soya L-alpha-lecithin and nonionic surfactant, span 20. The effort was made to study in vitro whether acyclovir-loaded nanovesicles could sustain the release of the drug by increasing residence time and thus, acyclovir could reduce its dose-related systemic toxicity. There were good vesicular distributions in both of the niosomes and the liposomes. The obtained vesicles were within 1 microm and about 35% of them were within a size of 100 nm. The percentage of drug loading varied and the niosomal vesicles contained more drug as compared with the liposomes. When the in vitro drug release was compared, it was found that the liposomes released about 90% drug in 150 min whereas the drug release was just 50% from the niosomal vesicles in 200 min. Again, the niosomes showed better stability compared with the liposomes. Thus, niosome could be a better choice for intravenous delivery of acyclovir.

574192|t|Intranuclear injection of anti-actin antibodies into Xenopus oocytes blocks chromosome condensation.
574192|a|The role of contractile proteins in the structural organisation of the interphase nucleus and of metaphase chromosomes is largely unknown. Actin has been found in interphase nuclei of different species, especially in association with condensed chromatin. In the germinal vesicle (nucleus) of Xenopus oocytes, actin has been localised in the nuclear gel supporting the chromosomes and the extrachromosomal nucleoli. It has been reported that the premeiotic lampbrush chromosomes in these germinal vesicles are positively stained for actin and tubulin by the immunoperoxidase technique. Moreover, the longitudinal contraction of these chromosomes is ATP dependent. Therefore it has been suggested that actin participates in the structural organisation of the highly specialised lampbrush chromosomes. However, actin is not a major component of the metaphase chromosome scaffold. The results reported here suggest that actin is involved in the condensation of Xenopus chromosomes.

14714104|t|Specificity grouping of the accessory gene regulator quorum-sensing system of Staphylococcus epidermidis is linked to infection.
14714104|a|Staphylococcus epidermidis represents the most frequent pathogen involved in nosocomial infections and infections of indwelling medical devices. The strain-to-strain variation of the gene encoding the quorum-sensing pheromone of S. epidermidis as well as the correlation between specificity groups and origin from infection were determined. The pro-pheromone gene was highly conserved and showed infrequent, non-synonymous, single-nucleotide polymorphisms that led to conservative amino acid exchanges only. Importantly, one specificity group was significantly more frequent among strains isolated from infection. The finding that quorum-sensing specificity groups are linked to infection demonstrates the relevance of quorum-sensing for virulence in this critical human pathogen and contributes to the scientific basis needed for the development of quorum-sensing-targeting drugs.

6153961|t|Far-field cochlear microphonic responses to continuous pure tones recorded from the scalps of cats.
6153961|a|The cochlear microphonic response to continuous pure tones has been recorded in the 'far field' from the scalps of anesthetized cats. Previous methods for scalp recording used tone pip transients only. Our experiments show that the observed wave forms are not due to electrical or mechanoelectrical artifacts. Neural responses such as brain stem responses or the frequency-following response have been excluded as major contributors to the observed wave forms, which are virtually identical to the round window cochlear microphonic response with respect to (1) wave shape with non-sinusoidal stimuli, (2) intensity-amplitude functions, (3) response phase, and (4) amplitude changes due to superimposed band-limited white noise. The methods of ruling out significant artifacts are applicable to non-invasive recordings from humans.

16584597|t|Bone marrow angiogenesis in aplastic anemia.
16584597|a|The objective of this study was to investigate the status of bone marrow angiogenesis in aplastic anemia (AA). Bone marrow specimens from 32 patients with AA and 16 normal controls were studied. The number of bone marrow microvessels was examined by means of immunohistochemical staining for CD34. Determination of microvessel density (MVD) and angiogenesis grading were done in a blinded manner. The results showed that the bone marrow MVD in patients with AA was significantly lower than that in healthy subjects (P < 0.01). MVD in patients with severe and moderate AA was lower than that in control group, respectively (P < 0. 01). There is significant MVD difference between severe AA and moderate AA (P < 0.05). Angiogenesis grade and MVD in AA were positively correlated (r = 0.64, P < 0.01). It is concluded that bone marrow angiogenesis in AA patients is lower than that in normal controls. Defect of angiogenesis in bone marrow may play a role resulting in or aggravating hematopoietic aplasia in patients with AA.

11386613|t|Effect of dopexamine on hepatic metabolic activity in patients with septic shock.
11386613|a|Hepato-splanchnic metabolic activity is seen to be related to regional blood flow and oxygen/substrate availability in patients with sepsis. Catecholamines, which may modulate metabolic activity perse, are common to stabilize hemodynamics. We studied the effect of a dopexamine-induced increase in splanchnic blood flow (Qspl) on regional metabolic rate in 10 patients with septic shock requiring norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (>60 mmHg). Splanchnic blood flow was determined using the indocyanine-green method with hepatic venous sampling. We determined the hepato-splanchnic lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and glutamine turnover and the lactate/pyruvate and ketone body ratio as well as the endogenous glucose production (EGP) using the stable isotope approach. Qspl increased from 0.86 (0.79-1.15) to 0.96 (0.92-1.33) L/min/m2, not influencing any parameter of metabolic activity. We speculate that this finding is due to altered beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated thermogenic effects due to the interplay of different beta-sympathomimetics at the receptor site.

9729442|t|Identification and cloning of a developmentally regulated Cryptosporidium parvum gene by differential mRNA display PCR.
9729442|a|To identify Cryptosporidium parvum genes expressed during intracellular development, differential mRNA display was used to detect differences in gene expression between mock-infected and C. parvum-infected human epithelial cells. A reproducible band present only in C. parvum-infected cells, ddHC-23, was isolated and cloned. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that ddHC-23 represented a C. parvum gene. RT-PCR revealed that HC-23 mRNA levels decreased from 6 to 12h post-infection (pi), were maximally expressed at 24h pi, and returned to low levels at 48 and 72h pi. Northern blot analysis determined that the approx. 3.6kb transcript is expressed by sporozoites prior to invasion of epithelial cells. Screening of a C. parvum genomic library with ddHC-23 isolated a genomic subclone which contained a 2790bp ORF, uninterrupted by introns. Sequence analysis indicated that the encoded protein, which displayed no similarity to any sequences in the public databases, contained a high proportion of polar amino acids, with the most abundant being Asp (17.3%), Ser (15.8%) and Gly (8.1%). Numerous potential sites for posttranslational modification were present including: casein kinase II and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, N-myristolation sites and N-glycosylation sites. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of differential mRNA display for identifying developmentally regulated C. parvum genes within the background of genes expressed by the host cell. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

3535367|t|Sealing of retinal breaks with metal tacks. Evaluation of a new procedure in retinal re-attachment surgery.
3535367|a|Metal retinal tacks were used in 18 patients with complicated retinal detachments, such as giant tears (3 cases), severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) (7 eyes) and diabetic traction and rhegmatogenous detachment (8 cases). All eyes had undergone vitreous microsurgery, including excision or segmentation of epiretinal membranes, fluid-air (SF6) or silicone oil exchange. Retinal breaks and the cut edges of retinotomies and retinectomies were successfully sealed by metal tacks. Retinal re-attachment was achieved in 9 cases and partial re-attachment in another 5 eyes (follow-up 3-6 months). Retinal tears in diabetic macular detachment associated with extensive epiretinal fibrovascular membranes were also successfully sealed despite persisting traction. Our first experience indicates that the closing of retinal breaks with metal tacks is a major step forward in retinal re-attachment surgery.

5441538|t|Hemolysis of "stress" reticulocytes: a source of erythropoietic bilirubin formation.
5441538|a|The formation of bilirubin-(14)C was measured in rats given transfusions of red blood cells containing (14)C-labeled hemoglobin heme. Per cent conversion of hemoglobin-(14)C to bilirubin was 4 times greater with transfusion of "stress" reticulocytes from rats responding to hemorrhage than with normal reticulocytes from unstimulated donors. When the increased number of labeled reticulocytes produced by hemorrhaged donors was also considered, the total magnitude of labeled bilirubin formation was almost 20 times higher with stress as compared to normal reticulocytes. The findings were not influenced by splenectomy of either donor or recipient rats, iron loading of donors, or bleeding of recipients. However, bilirubin-(14)C formation fell off progressively as studies were performed at longer intervals after erythroid stimulation. Total bilirubin-(14)C formation in rats transfused with stress reticulocytes was compared to the production of early-labeled bilirubin from all potential sources in intact rats bled according to the same schedule used in the transfusion experiments. It is estimated that degradation of hemoglobin from sress reticulocytes accounts for virtually the entire rise in erythropoietic bilirubin formation from 24 to 96 hr after glycine-2-(14)C administration, but that additional sources make a major contribution before that time. These findings are consistent with the concept that destruction of immature erythroid cells in the peripheral blood, and probably in the bone marrow, accompanies the physiologic response to erythroid stimulation.

2360467|a|In a retrospective study the clinical management of 74 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) admitted in grade IV and V Hunt and Hess was examined. 39 patients (53%) were admitted within 24 hours after SAH, 29 patients (39%) between 24 and 72 hours after SAH, and 6 patients 8%) later than this time interval. The ruptured aneurysms were located at the anterior communicating artery complex in 34 patients (46%), on the middle cerebral artery in 19 patients (26%), on the internal carotid artery in 12 patients (16%) and at the vertebro-basilar artery complex in 9 patients (12%). In 38 patients (51%) no surgical attack on the aneurysm was performed. 19 (50%) of these patients were in grade IV on admission and 19 (50%) in grade V. In 36 patients (49%) the aneurysm was clipped. Of these patients 29 (81%) were in grade IV and 7 (19%) in grade V. Of the 38 patients in whom no aneurysm surgery was done, 37 patients died, representing a mortality rate of 97%, one patient survived in grade III Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Concerning the outcome in those patients with aneurysm clipping, of 19 patients in grade IV operated on early, 10 patients (53%) made a good recovery, 3 (16%) were left severely disabled and 6 patients (31%) remained in a vegetative state or died. Of the 10 patients in grade IV with delayed surgery 4 (40%) were in grade I and II postoperatively, 2 (20%) in grade III, and again 4 (40%) in grade IV and V GOS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The synthesis was carried out by imidazole-catalyzed coupling of the 5'-monophosphate of 1, 2, and 5 with AMP. These dinucleotides, which are also analogues of thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD) and selenazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (SAD), the active metabolites of the oncolytic C-nucleosides 2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide (tiazofurin) and 2-beta-D-ribofuranosylselenazole-4-carboxamide (selenazofurin), were evaluated for their inhibitory potency against recombinant human IMPDH type I and II.

12860923|t|Molecular mechanism for ATP-dependent closure of the K+ channel Kir6.2.
12860923|a|In the ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channel pore-forming protein Kir6.2, mutation of three positively charged residues, R50, K185 and R201, impairs the ability of ATP to close the channel. The mutations do not change the channel open probability (Po) in the absence of ATP, supporting the involvement of these residues in ATP binding. We recently proposed that at least two of these positively charged residues, K185 and R201, interact with ATP phosphate groups to cause channel closure: the beta phosphate group of ATP interacts with K185 to initiate closure, while the alpha phosphate interacts with R201 to stabilize the channel's closed state. In the present study we replaced these three positive residues with residues of different charge, size and hydropathy. For K185 and R201, we found that charge, more than any other property, controls the interaction of ATP with Kir6.2. At these positions, replacement with another positive residue had minor effects on ATP sensitivity. In contrast, replacement of K185 with a negative residue (K185D/E) decreased ATP sensitivity much more than neutral substitutions, suggesting that an electrostatic interaction between the beta phosphate group of ATP and K185 destabilizes the open state of the channel. At R201, replacement with a negative charge (R201E) had multiple effects, decreasing ATP sensitivity and preventing full channel closure at high concentrations. In contrast, the R50E mutation had a modest effect on ATP sensitivity, and only residues such as proline and glycine that affect protein structure caused major decreases in ATP sensitivity at the R50 position. Based on these results and the recently published structure of Kir3.1 cytoplasmic domain, we propose a scheme where binding of the beta phosphate group of ATP to K185 induces a motion of the surrounding region, which destabilizes the open state, favouring closure of the M2 gate. Binding of the alpha phosphate group of ATP to R201 then stabilizes the closed state. R50 on the N-terminus controls ATP binding by facilitating the interaction of the beta phosphate group of ATP with K185 to destabilize the open state.

959136|a|Radiological changes that may occur in the depenent lung when surgery is performed in the lateral position are generally of a transient nature; they disappear when the position of the patient is changed after the operation, but may, in some cases, be demonstrable post-operatively as atelectatic areas. From the second post-operative day onwards, and reaching a peak on the 5th post-operative day, there is an increased incidence of ventilatory disturbances and infiltrations. The course and distribution of these pulmonary disturbances point to post-operative immobilization in the recumbent position as the main causal factor.

10713193|t|Techniques of coiling cerebral aneurysms.
10713193|a|BACKGROUND: More than 200 aneurysms have been coiled at the UIC Medical Center within the last 5 years. We describe in detail the technical factors that increase the chance of complete occlusion of a cerebral aneurysm with coils. Aneurysms selected for coiling have good geometry or are in a location that is difficult to reach surgically. Patients with medical conditions that preclude surgical treatment may also undergo coiling. METHODS: Patients with aneurysms, either ruptured or unruptured, are treated under general anesthesia, fully anticoagulated and deeply paralyzed. Coiling is done under simultaneous biplane roadmapping. After the first coil has created a mesh, the aneurysm is densely packed with soft coils of decreasing diameter, until no more coils can be deployed into the aneurysm. RESULTS: The morbidity and mortality rates associated with the coiling procedure have continuously decreased over the last 5 years. The morphological outcomes have improved, due to extensive use of the remodeling technique and to advancements in materials, such as refinements in the coils themselves or the availability of over-the-wire balloon catheters in different sizes and hydrophilic wires with complex tip configurations. Twenty-one percent of the aneurysms were considered to be incompletely occluded immediately after coiling. Of this group, one-third of the aneurysms were found to be completely occluded on follow-up angiograms by 6 months; these have remained occluded. One-third were more than 95% occluded after the coiling procedure; in these patients, the dome was completely occluded, but there was a small neck remnant, which has remained stable in all patients on control angiograms obtained at 6 months and 1, 2, and 4 years; none have rebled. These patients are followed medically. The remaining one-third of the aneurysms in this subgroup were less than 95% occluded, although the dome was completely thrombosed. None of them have rebled, but the neck remnant in most has regrown over a period ranging from 6 months to 2 years. These patients have undergone a second treatment-either surgical clipping, permanent occlusion of the parent vessel, or repeat coiling using the remodeling technique. The overall rebleeding rate of incompletely occluded aneurysms is extremely low (less than 1%). CONCLUSION: The low morbidity and mortality rates and the good morphological outcome obtained in most cases make coiling a reasonable alternative to surgical clipping in properly selected cases.

8877883|t|In situ ocular absorption of tilisolol through ocular membranes in albino rabbits.
8877883|a|The purpose of this study is to characterize the in situ absorption properties of ocular membranes using a cylindrical cell. Drug disappearance in the cell was determined as in situ absorption after an application of drug solution into the cell on the comea, sclera (bulbar conjunctiva and sclera layer), or palpebral conjunctiva. Tilisolol was used as a model of an ophthalmic beta-blocker. Tilisolol disappeared from the conjunctival and scleral surfaces although hardly any disappearance of tilisolol from the corneal surface was observed. Depletion of drug from the precorneal space was much faster in situ than extrapolated from permeability measurements (in vitro) of the separate tissues. This may arise from an influence of blood flow. The in situ apparent permeability coefficient of tilisolol through the conjunctiva was almost constant at various concentrations of drug (5-100 mM), suggesting a passive diffusion of tilisolol that was affected by medium pH. A high concentration of tilisolol in the aqueous humor was observed in the corneal application although the scleral and conjunctival applications showed a slight concentration of tilisolol. The corneal route was a dominant route of access to the aqueous humor. Access to the vitreous body for tilisolol was 4 times more effective through the sclera than through the cornea. On the other hand, the corneal application showed an extremely low concentration of tilisolol in plasma compared to the scleral and conjunctival applications. Thus, the in situ method using a cylindrical cell is a useful method for investigation of the ocular absorption of ophthalmic drugs.

1380430|t|Compassionate use of a 5-HT3-receptor antagonist, tropisetron, in patients refractory to standard antiemetic treatment.
1380430|a|The efficacy of tropisetron in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy of varying emetogenic potential was evaluated in 545 patients with a variety of malignancies who had either proved refractory to antiemetic treatment during previous chemotherapy courses or who were considered to be at high risk of nausea and vomiting. Tropisetron 5 or 10mg was administered intravenously just before chemotherapy, with the possibility of additional oral or intravenous doses on the day before chemotherapy and on 1 or more subsequent days. On day 1 of the first course of chemotherapy, a complete response (no nausea and no vomiting) was achieved in 62% of patients and a partial response (1 to 4 vomits and/or episodes of nausea) in 29%. Among the 325 patients who received a second course of chemotherapy, more than 80% of those with a complete response on day 1 of course 1 also had a complete response on day 1 of course 2; 37% and 26%, respectively, of patients with a partial response or failure (1 or more vomits and/or episodes of nausea) on day 1 of course 1 then had a complete response on day 1 of course 2.

8585536|t|Do monoclonal antibodies and anticytokines still have a future in infectious diseases?
8585536|a|The continuing high mortality of septic shock has prompted a major effort by the research community to identify novel therapeutic targets. These targets can be conveniently grouped into (1) those derived from microbial components or products; (2) inflammatory mediators; and (3) effector molecules. Many of the experimental, so-called adjunctive agents developed have been monoclonal antibodies or anticytokine molecules of various kinds, and some have progressed into clinical trial. Unfortunately, these trials have failed to show unequivocal survival benefit for patients in shock, prompting a reappraisal of our approach to these agents. In this article, we discuss the possible reasons for these failures: (1) the targets are wrong; (2) the agents are inappropriate; or (3) the trial design is flawed. It would be premature to conclude that adjunctive agents have no future in the therapy of sepsis, but identifying the correct agent, and perhaps more importantly, the correct target population, is going to be more difficult than was at first believed.

16328985|t|Development of an enumeration method for arsenic methylating bacteria from mixed culture samples.
16328985|a|Bacterial methylation of arsenic converts inorganic arsenic into volatile and non-volatile methylated species. It plays an important role in the arsenic cycle in the environment. Despite the potential environmental significance of AsMB, an assessment of their population size and activity remains unknown. This study has now established a protocol for enumeration of AsMB by means of the anaerobic-culture-tube, most probable number (MPN) method. Direct detection of volatile arsenic species is then done by GC-MS. This method is advantageous as it can simultaneously enumerate AsMB and acetate and formate-utilizing methanogens. The incubation time for this method was determined to be 6 weeks, sufficient time for AsMB growth.

10335406|t|[Isolation of trypsin PC from the Kamchatka crab Paralithodes camtschatica and its properties]
10335406|a|Trypsin PC from the hepatopancreas of the king crab Paralithodes camtschatica was isolated and purified to apparent homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography on Aminosilochrom and DEAE-Sephadex and affinity chromatography on arginine-agarose. The yield of the enzyme was 37.7%, and the purification degree was 21. Trypsin PC has a molecular mass of 29 kDa and pI < 2.5. It hydrolysis N-benzoyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide at the optimum pH of 7.5-8.0 and at the temperature optimum of 55 degrees C (K(m) = 0.05 mM). Trypsin PC retained its activity within the pH range of 5.8-9.0 in the presence of Ca2+. The enzyme was inhibited by the specific inhibitors of serine proteases diisopropyl fluorophoshate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, by the trypsin inhibitor N-tosyl-L-lysylchloromethylketone, and by the trypsin inhibitors from soybean and potato. Trypsin PC was found to hydrolyze amide bonds formed by carboxylic groups of lysine and arginine in peptide substrates. The N-terminal sequence of this enzyme is IVGGTEVTPG.

9741972|t|Inactivation of enzymes within spores of Bacillus megaterium ATCC 19213 by hydroperoxides.
9741972|a|The organic hydroperoxides t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and peracetic acid were found to act similarly to hydrogen peroxide in causing inactivation of enzymes within intact spores of bacillus megaterium ATCC 19213 concomitant with mortality. Spores treated with lethal levels of the agents were germinated and permeabilized for enzyme assays. The hierarchy of sensitivities among enolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6Pdh), and pyruvate kinase to inactivation varied somewhat with the specific hydroperoxide used, possibly because of the differences in the types of radicals generated. However, each agent inactivated each of the enzymes, albeit at different rates. Comparative assessments of enzyme inactivation by lethal levels of H2O2 or by moist heat showed that some enzymes, such as G6Pdh, are highly sensitive to inactivation, while others, such as ATPases, are much more resistant. The enzymes G6Pdh and aldolase were highly sensitive to hydroperoxide inactivation and also to moist heat, while pyruvate kinase was much more sensitive to hydroperoxides than to moist heat. Our overall interpretation of the findings is that hydroperoxides and moist heat can produce cumulative damage to sensitive enzymes within spores, which progressively diminishes the capacities of the cells to undergo the outgrowth required for return to vegetative life.

18639345|t|Effect of upper airway obstruction on pulmonary arterial pressure in children.
18639345|a|OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure in children with upper airway obstruction caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy according to their disease severity assessed with symptom scoring and to demonstrate the profit for echocardiographic monitorization of the children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy regardless of their clinical status. METHODS: Thirty-nine children with a diagnosis of upper airway obstruction caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy were included for the study. There were 16 female and 23 male patients. Ages of the children were between 3 and 10 years with a mean age of 5.78+/-1.98. Twenty children composed the control group with a similar age and sex distribution but without any sign and symptom of upper airway obstruction. Mean pulmonary arterial pressures were measured by Doppler echocardiography preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Symptom scores were calculated for each patient in the study group to assess their disease severity. The significances of changes and relations between pressure levels and symptom scores were calculated by statistical package for social sciences (SSPS) computer program in terms of Student's test, chi(2)-test and Mc Nemar's test. RESULTS: Mean pulmonary arterial pressure were 26.26+/-5.40 (14-36) preoperatively, 16,61+/-2.68 (10.15-22.3) postoperatively and 16.54+/-2.63 (10.5-21.7) in the control group. There were a statistically significant decrease at pressure levels postoperatively and a significant difference from the levels in the control group (Student's t-test, p<0.01). We found no correlation between the pressure levels and disease severity assessed in terms of symptom scoring. CONCLUSION: This study showed that upper airway obstruction caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy causes significant elevation of pulmonary arterial pressures and adenotonsilectomy is an absolute therapeutic method in these children. Every child with adenotonsillar hypertrophy has some probability of having pulmonary hypertension regardless of his or her disease severity. Therefore, performing echocardiographic examination to all children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy is beneficial for assessing the cardiopulmonary status of the patient and may be useful at decision making for adenotonsilectomy.

17308253|t|Living long with short bowel syndrome: a historical case of twenty-nine years of living with home parenteral nutrition.
17308253|a|BACKGROUND: This paper traces the 29-year survival of Robert Thomas, who received home parenteral nutrition (PN), and contrasts his oral narrative with the clinical history of PN. METHODS: Interviews, chart review, review of the literature, and historical analysis. RESULTS: Bobby Thomas was part of an early group of patients scattered throughout the country who, with their medical team, provided the foundation for more successful survival with home PN. They learned together and taught numerous nutrition support clinicians the intricacies of patient management. The importance of the patient to the teaching function of new and experienced practitioners is highly critical. Patients like Robert Thomas gave practitioners firsthand evidence of both the tenacity of the human spirit and the complexity and difficulties of chronic illness and its treatments. CONCLUSIONS: While Bobby struggled with the complications and difficulties that came with the disease and the treatment keeping him alive, his own experiences over 29 years, as told to his medical team during his treatment and to informed interviewers before he died, tell a story that is both intersecting and parallel to the medical history. Pioneering patients like Bobby Thomas confirm the possibility of survival. They also, through their own negotiations to maintain a sense of control, can live lives they themselves help define.

9378682|t|Effects of a respite from work on burnout: vacation relief and fade-out.
9378682|a|In a quasi-experiment designed to examine the relief from job stress and burnout afforded by a vacation respite, 76 clerks completed measures of job stress and burnout twice before a vacation, once during vacation, and twice after vacation. There was a decline in burnout during the vacation and a return to prevacation levels by the time of the second postvacation measure. Comparing the two prevacation measures indicated no anticipation effects. However, the return to work showed gradual fade-out, as burnout returned part way toward its prevacation level by 3 days after the vacation and all the way by 3 weeks after the vacation. Women and those satisfied with their vacations experienced greater relief; however, both subsamples also experienced the quickest fade-out. The respite effect and its complete fade-out were detected among all subgroups analyzed. Burnout, relief, interpersonal stress crossover, and burnout climate at work are discussed.

8690232|t|Dapsone toxicity: some current perspectives.
8690232|a|1. Dapsone is a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic compound, which is metabolised by cytochrome P-450 to hydroxylamines, which in turn cause methaemoglobinaemia and haemolysis. However, during the process of methaemoglobin formation, erythrocytes are capable of detoxifying the hydroxylamine to the parent drug, which may either reach the tissues to exert a therapeutic effect or return to the liver and be re-oxidised in a form of systemic cycling. This glutathione-dependent effect, combined with the un-ionised state of the drug at physiological pH, may contribute to its efficacy. 2. Paradoxically, other aspects of the glutathione-dependent cycling of the hydroxylamine metabolite may contribute to the major adverse reaction of the drug, agranulocytosis. Erythrocytes exposed to the metabolite and repeatedly washed may still release the hydroxylamine in sufficient concentration to kill mononuclear leucocytes in vitro. Thus, erythrocytes may be a conduit for the hydroxylamine to reach the bone marrow to covalently bind to granulocyte precursors, which may trigger an immune response in certain individuals and may lead to the potentially fatal eradication of granulocytes from the circulation. 3. Attempts to increase patient tolerance to dapsone have been most successful using a metabolic inhibitor to reduce hepatic oxidation of the drug to the hydroxylamine. Methaemoglobin formation in the presence of cimetidine was maintained at 30% below control levels for almost 3 mo, and patients' reported side effects such as headache and lethargy were significantly reduced. 4. As clinical application of new and safer dapsone analogues is years away, the use of cimetidine provides an immediate route to increasing patient compliance during dapsone therapy, especially in those maintained on dapsone dosages in excess of 200 mg/day.

15518219|t|Infant color vision: influence of surround chromaticity on spontaneous looking preferences.
15518219|a|When infants are tested with stimuli of various chromaticities embedded in a dark or achromatic (white) surround, they show maximal preference for stimuli of maximal colorimetric purity, and minimal preference for achromatic stimuli. We investigated how this pattern of preferences changes with changes of surround chromaticity. Sixteen-week-old infants were tested in two experimental conditions. The surrounds in the first condition were red and white; and in the second condition green and white. The three test stimuli varied in colorimetric purity from white to red in the first condition, and from white to green in the second condition. A test stimulus that appeared achromatic to adults when viewed in the chromatic surround was included. Infant spontaneous looking preferences changed with changes of surround chromaticity. The changes were consistent with the conclusion that infant looking behavior is governed by a preference for the stimuli that differ maximally in purity from the surround. The implications of this pattern of results are discussed.

14714771|t|Increasing the antioxidative capacity of neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass prime solution: an in vitro study.
14714771|a|Inflammation and oxidative damage are believed to play an important role in the postoperative complications after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in neonates. During the preparation of the prime, red blood cells (RBCs) release non-protein-bound iron (NPBI) and free haemoglobin/haem (Hb/haem). The presence of these prooxidants in the prime solution may increase oxidative stress in neonates undergoing CPB. The solution used as the basis of the prime solution may influence the degree of this oxidative stress. We investigated the NPBI and the Hb/haem binding capacities of two different prime solutions: a prime based on pasteurized human albumin and a prime based on fresh frozen plasma. The presence of NPBI and free Hb/haem were measured during and after the preparation of the prime solution. Only in the albumin prime was NPBI detectable. However, in both primes, the concentrations of free Hb/haem increased. Thus, to reduce the prooxidative effects of NPBI and free Hb/haem, RBCs should be added to the prime at the last possible moment. Adding fresh frozen plasma should be considered, as this would result in no detectable NPBI in the prime solution.

1380501|t|Determination of the number of polypeptide subunits in a functional VDAC channel from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
1380501|a|Genes encoding VDAC proteins containing specific site-directed amino acid alterations were introduced into wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mutant VDAC proteins form channels with ion selectivities very different from that of the wild-type channel. Therefore, the resulting yeast strains express two different genes capable of coding for functional, yet distinct, VDAC channels. If VDAC were an oligomeric channel, analysis of VDAC from these strains should have revealed not only the presence of channels with wild-type or mutant selectivity but also channels with intermediate selectivities. While channels with wild-type and mutant selectivities were observed with approximately equal frequency, no channels with intermediate selectivity were observed. Sufficient observations were performed with two different mutant genes K61E.K65E and K19E.K61E) that the likelihood of having missed hybrid channels was less than 1 in 10(7). These findings favor the hypothesis that each functional VDAC channel is composed of a single 30-kDa polypeptide chain.

14598169|t|Polymerase chain reaction-based genotype classification among human Blastocystis hominis populations isolated from different countries.
14598169|a|Since the genotype of human Blastocystis hominis isolates is highly polymorphic, PCR-based genotype classification using known sequenced-tagged site (STS) primers would allow the identification or classification of different genotypes. Five populations of human B. hominis isolates obtained from Japan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Germany, and Thailand were subjected to genotype analysis by using seven kinds of STS primers. Ninety-nine out of 102 isolates were identified as one of the known genotypes, while one isolate from Thailand showed two distinct genotypes and two isolates from Japan were negative with all the STS primers. The most dominant genotype among four populations, except for all four isolates from Thailand, was subtype 3 and it varied from 41.7% to 92.3%. The second most common genotype among four populations was either subtype 1 (7.7-25.0%) or subtype 4 (10.0-22.9%). Subtype 2, subtype 5, and/or subtype 7 were only rarely detected among the isolates from Japan and Germany, while subtype 6 was not detected. The phylogenetic position of the two isolates which were negative with all STS primers, was inferred from the small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) genes with the known sequence data of 20 Blastocystis isolates. Since the two isolates were positioned in an additional clade in the phylogenetic tree, this suggested they were a new genotype. These results demonstrated that PCR-based genotype classification is a powerful tool with which to analyse genotypes of Blastocystis isolates obtained from clinical samples. In addition, two groups of the isolates from 15 symptomatic and 11 asymptomatic patients in Bangladesh were compared with the PCR-based subtype classification. Since both groups were only classified into two distinct genotypes of subtype 1 or subtype 3 and no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups, in this study it could not be shown that the specific genotype correlated with the pathogenic potential of B. hominis.

6885221|t|The crisis of the British welfare state.
6885221|a|This paper analyzes the implications of the rightward shift currently underway in the advanced capitalist world for the future of the welfare state. The Thatcher government in Britain is examined as a paradigm case of this new conservatism. The quantitative cuts in social spending as well as the quantitative shifts in social policy and ideological reversals of recent years are detailed, and the contradictions of both Thatcherism and its predecessor--social democratic reformism--are exposed from the perspective of Marxist political economy. A postscript attempts to explain the continuing popularity of Thatcherism in contemporary Britain despite the devastating effects of its policies.

16133992|t|Mechanisms of apoptosis of T-cells in human tuberculosis.
16133992|a|The role of TGF-beta TNF-alpha FasL and Bcl-2 in apoptosis of CD4 T-cells during active TB was studied. Coculture of PBMC from TB patients with neutralizing antibodies to TGF-beta or TNF-alpha decreased spontaneous (P < or = 0.05) and MTB-induced (P < or = 0.02) T-cell apoptosis by 50-90%, but effects were not additive. Interestingly, only levels of TGF-beta in supernatants correlated with rates of spontaneous and MTB-induced apoptosis. FasL surface and mRNA expression were higher in unstimulated and MTB-stimulated PBMC from patients than controls, and neutralization of FasL abrogated apoptosis of T-cells from patients only. Intracellular Bcl-2 protein was lower among unstimulated CD4 T-cells from patients than those from controls (P < or = 0.02), and MTB stimulation reduced intracellular Bcl-2 content in CD4 T-cells from patients only (P < or = 0.001). These findings may indicate that, during TB, predisposition of CD4 T-cells to apoptosis may involve both low expression of Bcl-2, and excessive expression of TGF-beta TNF-alpha and FasL.

12700220|t|Cross sectional survey of perpetrators, victims, and witnesses of violence in Bogota, Colombia.
12700220|a|OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence and distribution of witnesses, victims, and perpetrators of different types of violence in the general population and the proportion of victims consulting health services or reporting the incident to authorities. METHODS: Cross sectional survey of a random sample of 3007 inhabitants between the ages of 15 and 60 in the city of Bogota, Colombia, in 1997, based on a face to face interview. RESULTS: Age adjusted past year prevalence of witnesses, victims, and perpetrators of physical aggression was 61%, 27%, and 27%, respectively, while lifetime prevalence of witnesses, victims, and perpetrators of assault with a weapon in this population reached 70%, 55%, and 5.8%. Between 11% and 67% of the victims consulted a health service and less than 32% reported the incident to an authority. Those involved in most types of physical violence tended to be young, male, from lower middle social classes, with some degree of secondary education, and single or divorced. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of witnesses and victims of violence in this sample appears to be high, while perpetrators constitute a small proportion. Violence is not equally distributed throughout the population suggesting the possibility of identifying a population at higher risk for the development of intervention programmes.

7927437|t|Hypolipidemic activity of tincture of Crataegus in rats.
7927437|a|Tincture of Crataegus (TCR), an alcoholic extract of the berries of Crataegus oxyacantha, when administered to rats fed a hyperlipidemic diet (HLD), could prevent the elevation in plasma lipid levels. A significant decrease in lipid deposits in liver and aorta was also observed. Analysis of the plasma lipoprotein profile showed that TCR produced remarkable reduction in the increased levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) fractions in hyperlipidemic rats. Histological examination showed severe fatty vacuolation and degeneration of liver of HLD fed rats. TCR administration had an ameliorating effect on these changes. Agarose gel electrophoretic pattern of plasma lipoproteins also indicated that the drug brought down the raised levels of the atherogenic beta-lipoproteins in hyperlipidemic rats.

11261765|t|The central mechanism of the depressor-bradycardia effect of "Tinggong.
11261765|a|Roles of central adrenergic receptors and opioid receptors in the depressor-bradycardia effect of 3V, 2Hz "Tinggong-Quchi" electroacupuncture (the EA-DpB, i.e.the depressor bradycardia induced by electroacupuncture) were studied by intracerebroventricula (icv) injection of prazosin, yohimbine or propanol, naloxone or by intra-arachnoid (ith) injection of naloxone. Voltage-dependent depressor effects were induced by 2Hz "Tinggong-Quchi" acupuncture. The depressor effect of 3V, 2Hz " Tinggong-Quchi " acupuncture was attenuated by icv injection of a beta-receptor antagonist-propranolol, but was not blocked by the icv injection of an alpha1 -or (alpha2 -receptor antagonist prazosin or yohimbine. Icv injected naloxone but not ith injected naloxone blocked or reversed the EA-DpB. Results suggest that central P-receptors or opioid receptors in the brain are selectively involved in the EA-DpB.

8011648|t|Structural polymorphism of telomere DNA: interquadruplex and duplex-quadruplex conversions probed by Raman spectroscopy.
8011648|a|The solution secondary structures and nucleotide conformations in the telomeric DNA of Oxytricha nova have been determined by Raman spectroscopy. Structural polymorphism is demonstrated for both single-stranded [d(T4G4)4] and double-stranded [d(G4T4G4).d(C4A4C4)] telomere models. In the case of d(T4G4)4, which is a prototype for the single-stranded telomeric tail, an interquadruplex equilibrium involving parallel and antiparallel strand configurations is shown to be governed by the solution concentrations of both Na+ and K+. In both the parallel and antiparallel quadruplexes of d(T4G4)4, the local geometry of the phosphodiester backbone is similar to that of canonical B DNA, and associations between bases of the guanine quartet involve Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. However, the deoxyguanosine (dG) sugar conformations are significantly different in the two quadruplexes. In the extended parallel form, dG residues assume only the C2'-endo/anti conformation with respect to deoxyribose pucker and glycosyl orientation. In the foldback antiparallel form, dG residues are distributed equally between C2'-endo/anti and C2'-endo/syn conformations. In the case of d(G4T4G4).d(C4A4C4), which serves as a model for the double-stranded B DNA regions of Oxytricha telomeres, we show that disproportionation of the B form duplex to yield stable parallel quadruplexes of the guanine-rich strand occurs reversibly at high solution concentrations of either Na+ or K+. The present study reveals that both interquadruplex and duplex-quadruplex conversions of Oxytricha telomeric DNA are under the control of an alkali cation switch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

18942525|t|[Self monitoring of blood pressure in Guadeloupe in 2005 results of the PRETRAHGUAD enquiry]
18942525|a|The object of this enquiry was to estimate the number of self monitoring devices for blood pressure measurement in Guadeloupe in 2005 and to determine how they were used. The enquiry included 509 patients aged over 35 years and living in Guadeloupe meeting the inclusion criteria of PRETRAHGUAD: PREvalence et TRAitement de Hypertension en GUADeloupe. The enquiry was made by Qualistat, a survey institute. Designed as a survey, it was based on the two degree quota method. It was carried out by telephone by CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Inquiry) networked computer programming by ten operators trained by experts of the HTA-GWAD organisation. In addition to questions on socio-demographic background and biometric parameters, the operators also asked about observance of antihypertensive treatment, the ownership of a self monitoring blood pressure device and its usage. A subject who said he took a treatment validated as antihypertensive was considered to be a "treated hypertensive". The results indicate that in 2005, in Guadeloupe, 32% of the population over 35 years of age were treated hypertensives, making a total of 51,230 individuals. Forty three percent of treated hypertensives and 19% of other subjects admitted to having used a self monitoring blood pressure device. Twenty six percent of the study population owned a device. Of the estimated total of 43,220 devices in circulation, nearly half of them were wrist devices. Regular usage (at least once per month) was declared by 73% of hypertensive and 46% of other subjects. Out of the total population, the medical practitioner had spoken of self monitoring of blood pressure to his patients and had incited only 18% to carry it out. The authors conclude that, in 2005, one third of adults over 35 years of age were treated for hypertension and 43% of treated hypertensives owned a self monitoring blood pressure device. The incitation by medical practitioners to use this method of self monitoring remained modest. This technique would seem to be little used by medical practitioners although the patients have started to equip themselves with the device.

18662104|t|Deterministic pharmacophore detection via multiple flexible alignment of drug-like molecules.
18662104|a|We present a novel highly efficient method for the detection of a pharmacophore from a set of drug-like ligands that interact with a target receptor. A pharmacophore is a spatial arrangement of physico-chemical features in a ligand that is essential for the interaction with a specific receptor. In the absence of a known three-dimensional (3D) receptor structure, a pharmacophore can be identified from a multiple structural alignment of ligand molecules. The key advantages of the presented algorithm are: (a) its ability to multiply align flexible ligands in a deterministic manner, (b) its ability to focus on subsets of the input ligands, which may share a large common substructure, resulting in the detection of both outlier molecules and alternative binding modes, and (c) its computational efficiency, which allows to detect pharmacophores shared by a large number of molecules on a standard PC. The algorithm was extensively tested on a dataset of almost 80 ligands acting on 12 different receptors. The results, which were achieved using a set of standard default parameters, were consistent with reference pharmacophores that were derived from the bound ligand-receptor complexes. The pharmacophores detected by the algorithm are expected to be a key component in the discovery of new leads by screening large databases of drug-like molecules. A user-friendly web interface is available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/pharma. Supplementary material can be found at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/pharma/reduction/.

2145989|a|Partially purified antichalone and chalone from the liver of the mammals possess significant antiradical activity revealed by the chemiluminiscent analysis in the system capable of generating free radicals. Chemiluminiscent damping degree is proportional to the quantity of antichalone and chalone in the system. During the first three days the activity of antichalone is increased, while that of chalone in decreased in the liver of partially hepatectomized rats. In 14 days after partial hepatectomy the activity of both antichalone and chalone decreased, but their ratio is normalized. Thus, the regeneration of the liver in different periods after the operation takes place when the condition of antichalone/chalone system in the organ is unequal.

2168019|t|Hormonal control of Mg2+ transport in the heart.
2168019|a|Magnesium is abundant in the mammalian body and the second most abundant cation in cells. Because the concentration of intracellular free Mg2+ is relatively high (0.2-1 mM), Mg2+ is unlikely to act as a second messenger, like Ca2+, by rapidly changing its cytosolic concentration. But changes in Mg2+ do have profound effects on cellular metabolism, structure and bioenergetics. Key enzymes or metabolic pathways, mitochondrial ion transport, Ca2+ channel activities in the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles, ATP-requiring reactions, and structural properties of cells and nucleic acids are modified by changes in Mg2+ concentration. Yet, although some information is available from giant cells and bacteria, little is known about the regulation of intracellular Mg2+ in mammalian cells. Here we report a new transport mechanism for Mg2+ across the sarcolemma of cardiac cells in both intact hearts and dissociated myocytes. We show that noradrenaline, through beta-adrenergic stimulation and increase of cyclic AMP, stimulates a large efflux of Mg2+ from cardiac cells. This transport is of major dimensions and can move up to 20% of total cellular Mg2+ within a few minutes.

475004|a|Juvenile mice were treated for up to eight weeks with weekly doses of a synthetic analogue of cortisol:triamcinolone hexacetonide. The mandibular condylar cartilage was studied histologically and histochemically at regular intervals. Morphometric measurements were performed along the mandibular posterior vertical dimension (condylar process and ramus). By the second injection significant morphological changes were noted in the condylar cartilage, followed by retardation of bone growth. The most distinctive feature in the cartilage of triamcinolone-treated mice was a marked increase in the dimension of its mineralized zone concomitant with a significant increase in the number of hypertrophic chondrocytes. The role of condylar cartilage in mandibular growth is discussed.

3585827|t|The role of spouse reinforcement, perceived pain, and activity levels of chronic pain patients.
3585827|a|Levels of pain, activity, marital satisfaction, and contingent reinforcement for expressions of pain and suffering were assessed in chronic pain patients. In addition, spouses' marital satisfaction, mood, life control, and self-reported responses to the patient's pain were examined. Multiple regression analyses revealed that spouse reinforcement of overt expressions of pain was significantly related to both perceived pain and activity levels of chronic pain patients. The best predictor of patients' pain and activity levels was patients' perception of spouse reinforcement, followed by spouses' self-reported responses to the patients' pain. Spouse reinforcement of pain was not associated with spouses' marital satisfaction or perception of patients' pain levels. Rather, spouse reinforcement was associated with high interference of patients' pain with spouses' lives, spouses' positive mood, spouses' perception of more life control, as well as longer duration of the pain problem. The data support the importance of the spouse as a potential source of reinforcement of pain behavior.

10196196|t|SPI-B activates transcription via a unique proline, serine, and threonine domain and exhibits DNA binding affinity differences from PU.1.
10196196|a|SPI-B is a B lymphocyte-specific Ets transcription factor that shares a high degree of similarity with PU.1/SPI-1. In direct contrast to PU.1(-/-) mice that die in utero and lack monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, and T cells, Spi-B-/- mice are viable and exhibit a severe B cell proliferation defect. Since PU.1 is expressed at wild type levels in Spi-B-/- B cells, the mutant mice provide genetic evidence that SPI-B and PU.1 have at least some non-redundant roles in B lymphocytes. To begin to understand the molecular basis for these defects, we delineated functional domains of SPI-B for comparison to those of PU.1. By using a heterologous co-transfection system, we identified two independent transactivation domains in the N terminus of SPI-B. Interestingly, only one of these domains (amino acids 31-61), a proline/serine/threonine-rich region, unique among Ets proteins, is necessary for transactivation of the immunoglobulin lambda light chain enhancer. This transactivation motif is in marked contrast to PU.1, which contains acidic and glutamine-rich domains. In addition, we describe a functional PU.1 site within the c-FES promoter which SPI-B fails to bind efficiently and transactivate. Finally, we show that SPI-B interacts with the PU.1 cofactors Pip, TBP, c-Jun and with lower affinity to nuclear factor interleukin-6beta and retinoblastoma. Taken together, these data suggest that SPI-B binds DNA with a different affinity for certain sites than PU.1 and harbors different transactivation domains. We conclude that SPI-B may activate unique target genes in B lymphocytes and interact with unique, although currently unidentified, cofactors.

10447210|t|Induction of nociceptive responses by intrathecal injection of interleukin-1 in mice.
10447210|a|Intrathecal (i.t.) injection (between lumbar vertebrae 5 and 6) into mice of a markedly low dose of IL-1alpha (3x10(-4) fmol or 5.4 fg in 5 microl per mouse) induced behaviors involving scratching, biting, and licking of non-stimulated hindpaws. The IL-1-induced behaviors appeared within 10 min of the injection of IL-1alpha, peaked at 20-40 min, and had disappeared 60 min after the injection. The IL-1-induced behaviors were similar to the nociceptive responses induced in mice by i.t. injection of substance P (SP) or subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of formalin into the footpad. The IL-1-induced behaviors were suppressed by intraperitoneal morphine, indicating that they are nociceptive responses. The nociceptive responses induced by 3x10(-4) (5.4 fg) of IL-1alpha were almost completely suppressed by co-injection of 0.3 fmol (7.2 pg) of an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). An antiserum against substance P, but not an antiserum against somatostatin, suppressed the IL-1-induced nociceptive responses. The nociceptive responses induced by s.c. injection of 2% formalin into the footpad were also inhibited by i.t. injection of 30 pmol (720 ng) of IL-1ra. These results suggest that IL-1 may play a role in hyperalgesia in mice by acting as a factor augmenting pain transmission in the spinal cord at least in part by either directly or indirectly releasing substance P.

However, Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangle-like, senile plaque-like and fibrillary spindle figures were stained positively. S-100 beta positive structures increased in grade with age, but not always equally on Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles or senile plaques stained by Bodian method. Astrocytes decreased in number with age, and showed marked compensatory hypertrophy of their processes. S-100 beta positive structures seemed to be related to astroglial changes in terms of degeneration or loss of synapses.

12472325|t|Collaborative care management of late-life depression in the primary care setting: a randomized controlled trial.
12472325|a|CONTEXT: Few depressed older adults receive effective treatment in primary care settings. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of the Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) collaborative care management program for late-life depression. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with recruitment from July 1999 to August 2001. SETTING: Eighteen primary care clinics from 8 health care organizations in 5 states. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1801 patients aged 60 years or older with major depression (17%), dysthymic disorder (30%), or both (53%). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to the IMPACT intervention (n = 906) or to usual care (n = 895). Intervention patients had access for up to 12 months to a depression care manager who was supervised by a psychiatrist and a primary care expert and who offered education, care management, and support of antidepressant management by the patient's primary care physician or a brief psychotherapy for depression, Problem Solving Treatment in Primary Care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessments at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months for depression, depression treatments, satisfaction with care, functional impairment, and quality of life. RESULTS: At 12 months, 45% of intervention patients had a 50% or greater reduction in depressive symptoms from baseline compared with 19% of usual care participants (odds ratio [OR], 3.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.71-4.38; P<.001). Intervention patients also experienced greater rates of depression treatment (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.34-3.79; P<.001), more satisfaction with depression care (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 2.66-4.30; P<.001), lower depression severity (range, 0-4; between-group difference, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.46 to -0.33; P<.001), less functional impairment (range, 0-10; between-group difference, -0.91; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.64; P<.001), and greater quality of life (range, 0-10; between-group difference, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.79; P<.001) than participants assigned to the usual care group. CONCLUSION: The IMPACT collaborative care model appears to be feasible and significantly more effective than usual care for depression in a wide range of primary care practices.

1618594|t|Review: transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of interleukin 1 gene expression.
1618594|a|Interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and beta (IL-1 beta) are proinflammatory cytokines that are encoded by distinct genes, but share most biological activities. During the past several years, intense investigation has focused on elucidating the molecular basis for the regulation of IL-1 alpha and beta gene expression. While the overall organization of both genes is conserved in mammals, the DNA sequence homology is surprisingly limited. This supports the growing body of evidence suggesting that each gene is regulated by distinct cis- and transacting elements. Most recently, novel regulatory DNA sequence elements and several nuclear regulatory proteins have been identified, which ultimately participate in the control of IL-1 beta gene transcription. In addition to transcriptional controls, the stability of IL-1 mRNA can be selectively regulated by various inducing stimuli and other cytokines. Taken together, these transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms provide stringent, yet flexible, control over expression of the IL-1 alpha and beta genes.

10101683|t|Physiological effects and adjuvanticity of recombinant brushtail possum TNF-alpha.
10101683|a|The present paper describes the physiological properties of recombinant possum TNF-alpha and an adjuvant effect on antibody responses to the model protein antigen, keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). For these studies recombinant possum TNF-alpha was produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant cytokine was secreted into the culture medium and purified by gel filtration. Possum TNF-alpha produced in this expression system was N-glycosylated and bioactive in two different assays. In a murine fibroblast L929 cytotoxicity assay, the possum TNF-alpha had lower specific activity compared to human TNF-alpha, while in a possum-specific assay, possum TNF-alpha enhanced the proliferation of PHA-stimulated possum thymocytes and was more active than human TNF-alpha. The physiological effect of the recombinant possum TNF-alpha was investigated in groups of possums administered doses of 6, 30 or 150 micrograms of cytokine. For each dose, TNF-alpha caused profound effects on the numbers of circulating leucocytes characterized by a three-to-four-fold increase in neutrophil numbers at 6-24 h after injection and an initial sharp decrease in lymphocyte numbers. The efficacy of TNF-alpha as an immunological adjuvant was determined in possums administered KLH (125 micrograms) in an aqueous or Al(OH)3-based formulation with or without added recombinant TNF-alpha (150 micrograms). Serum antibody responses to KLH were monitored by ELISA. The TNF-alpha stimulated two-fold and four-fold increases in antibody levels in aqueous and Al(OH)3-based vaccine formulations, respectively. The strongest antibody responses were observed in the group of possums that received KLH formulated in Al(OH)3 with addition of TNF-alpha.

1801461|t|[The role of thrombocytes in blood coagulation disorders in infectious pathology]
1801461|a|Platelets play the leading role in circulatory disorders seen in patients with infectious diseases. Endotoxinemia leads to platelet activation which shows up by the transformation of platelet forms from disk-shaped to spheroidal and by changes in aggregation and secretion. The degree of those changes correlates with the disease gravity. Experimental endotoxinemia (in vivo and in vitro experiments) demonstrated the same changes in the morphofunctional properties of platelets together with a possibility of correcting circulatory disorders by blockers of prostaglandin biosynthesis, such as indomethacin++, trental and emoxipine.

6612766|t|Abrogation of epidermal antigen-presenting cell function by ultraviolet radiation administered in vivo.
6612766|a|The exposure of animals to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can result in dramatic alterations to their immunologic potential. Loss of ability to be contact-sensitized to skin-reactive chemicals applied to UVR-exposed surfaces, and an enhanced susceptibility to tumors induced by UVR represent two well-documented effects of such exposure. The skin Langerhans' cell (LC) is a cell type, having antigen presentation capabilities, which is functionally inactivated by UVR. The localized loss in the ability to induce a contact hypersensitivity (CS) response and the early events associated with the acquisition of a tumor-susceptible state have been hypothesized to involve LC inactivation by UVR. In this report we have investigated the relationship between the UVR-mediated loss of CS responsiveness and antigen-presenting cell (APC) function by LC following in vivo exposure of animals to UVR. The UVR-mediated loss of CS responsiveness was found to be both time-dependent and dosage-dependent, but the loss of epidermal APC function following the UVR exposure of dissociated epidermal cells or skin was immediate and dosage-dependent. The lack of time dependency associated with the loss of epidermal APC function may be due to the nature of the assay system being employed. Add-back experiments, using the proliferation of purified antigen-primed T-cells as a read-out system to evaluate APC function, require that the accessory cell be totally functional. Initiation of CS responses may still be possible, however, with LC that are partially UVR-inactivated. Lymph-node-associated and circulating accessory cells could be integrated into the response, providing any necessary components that the UV-inactivated LC lacks. We tested this possibility and conclude from these studies that this is indeed a viable possibility. Our results, therefore, provide a possible explanation for apparent differences in LC UVR susceptibility observed when in vitro and in vivo assays are employed.

15758870|a|Obstructive atherosclerotic carotid bifurcation disease is responsible for approximately 30% of stroke cases in the United States. Any successful treatment of this disease should demonstrate significant and durable reduction in the related risk for stroke without compromising the patient safety. The indications for CAS are evolving as the techniques, the stents and catheter technology advance. There is an ongoing need to improve the equipment suitable for carotid stenting and a need to enhance the safety of the procedure. Often, when a technical problem is encountered, it is attributed to the inadequacy of the devices currently available. As the technology improves, particularly with the application of the anti-embolization devices, the indications and contraindication may need to be revised.

6735592|t|Thermodynamics of thermal unfolding of bovine apo-alpha-lactalbumin.
6735592|a|Thermal unfolding of bovine alpha-lactalbumin in 10 mM borate buffer at pH 8.0 in the presence of 0.01-1.0 M NaCl was studied in terms of CD ellipticity. The apoprotein changes the conformation from a native-like (N) to an unfolded (U) form, which has an appreciable amount of the secondary structure but no tertiary structure, in the two-state type. Various thermodynamic parameters of the transition were analyzed. The differences in enthalpy and heat capacity between the N and U states are similar to the corresponding differences of the holoprotein obtained with the calorimetric method by Pfeil. It is shown that one Na+ binds with a binding constant larger than 10(2)-10(3) M-1 to a specific site (probably to the Ca2+-binding site) in the molecule and the bound Na+ stabilizes the N form of the apoprotein.

7291138|t|[Diagnostic value of the detection of serum antibodies to corticosteroma homogenates in primary chronic adrenal gland insufficiency]
7291138|a|To differentiate tuberculous and autoimmune affections of the adrenal cortex the Mantoux test was made in 15 patients with primary chronic adrenal insufficiency (PCAI), indirect hemagglutination with tuberculin antigen was performed and antibody titre to corticosteroma homogenate antigens was determined, in addition to the clinical pattern examination, by means of passive hemagglutination (the Boyden test). Antibodies to antigens from corticosteroma cells in the high titre (1 : 10240) were found in 5 of 6 patients without tuberculous affection of adrenals and in 4 of 9 subjects with adrenal tuberculosis. The study of the level of antibodies to corticosteroma homogenate antigens in the blood serum of patients suffering from PCAI cannot serve as a reliable criterion for differentiating the tuberculous affection and adrenal cortex destructive atrophy, often induced by autoimmune process.

3661150|a|The effects of a chronic three times a day treatment over a 5 to 6 week period of rabbit eyes with 1 of 5 topically applied glaucoma drugs on ocular blood flow was determined using a radioactive microsphere technique. The drugs employed were timolol (0.5%), pilocarpine (4%), epinephrine (2%), norepinephrine (2%), and ecothiophate iodide 0.125%). The results showed that epinephrine statistically decreased blood flow to the iris and ciliary processes while not to the posterior uveal tissues or optic nerve head. Pilocarpine also showed this same trend, while the differences were not statistically significant. Other drugs were without effect on regional ocular blood flow.

17487148|t|Synthesis of N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]fluorobenzoate, an agent for labeling proteins and peptides with 18F.
17487148|a|This protocol describes the step-by-step procedure for the synthesis of N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]fluorobenzoate ([18F]SFB), an agent widely used for labeling proteins and peptides with the positron-emitting radionuclide 18F. The protocols for the synthesis of unlabeled SFB and the quaternary salt precursor 4-formyl-N,N,N-trimethyl benzenaminium trifluoromethane sulfonate also are described. For the [18F]SFB synthesis, the quaternary salt is first converted to 4-[18F]fluorobenzaldehyde. Oxidation of the latter provides 4-[18F]fluorobenzoic acid, which is converted to [18F]SFB by treatment with N,N-disuccinimidyl carbonate. Using this method, [18F]SFB can be synthesized in decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 30%-35% and a specific radioactivity of 11-12 GBq micromol(-1). The total synthesis and purification time required is about 80 min, starting from delivery of the [18F]fluoride. [18F]SFB remains an optimal reagent for labeling proteins and peptides with 18F because of good conjugation yields and metabolic stability.

16966611|t|Progesterone blocks estrogen-induced DNA synthesis through the inhibition of replication licensing.
16966611|a|In the uterus, progesterone (P4) acts early in G1 as a physiological inhibitor of estradiol-17beta (E2)-induced epithelial cell proliferation. Gene expression profiling of uterine epithelial cell RNA isolated 3 h after hormonal treatment of ovariectomized mice revealed the co-coordinate down-regulation by P4 of >20 genes whose functions are associated with DNA replication. This group included all of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins that are required for DNA replication licensing. E2 regulated loading of these MCM proteins onto chromatin in parallel with its induction of DNA synthesis. E2 caused this chromatin loading by retention of MCM proteins in the nucleus and through the induction of the loading factor Cdt1, which is necessary for the MCM heterohexamer to bind to the origin of DNA replication. P4 dramatically reduced the binding of the MCMs to chromatin by a number of mechanisms. First, MCM mRNA and protein abundance was down-regulated. Second, P4 inhibited the E2 induction of Cdt1. Third, P4 treatment sequestered the normally nuclear MCM proteins into the cytoplasm. This reduced MCM binding resulted in the complete inhibition of E2-induced DNA synthesis by P4. These data reveal mechanisms not only for female sex steroid hormone action but also in the regulation of DNA replication licensing.

17634156|t|Antenatal exposure to DES: lessons learned...future concerns.
17634156|a|The short- and long-term effects of the widespread use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) over 3 decades have become a distant memory for many clinicians. Others are too young to remember the flurry of activity in the early 1970s on the part of many medical centers to identify the offspring of women who were prescribed DES during their pregnancies. This medication was given in an attempt to prevent multiple pregnancy-related problems such as miscarriage, premature birth, and abnormal bleeding. The recognition of the association of DES with an increased incidence of cervical and vaginal cancers in very young women led the Food and Drug Administration to ban its use during pregnancy in 1971. Other pregnancy-related problems for the daughters and genitourinary tract changes in the sons did not become apparent until years later. Ongoing follow-up of these offspring has raised concerns for their future as well as their mothers' future. Clinicians need to be up-to-date with current knowledge regarding risks for cancer and other health-related issues.

2536156|t|Positive genetic selection for gene disruption in mammalian cells by homologous recombination.
2536156|a|Efficient modification of genes in mammalian cells by homologous recombination has not been possible because of the high frequency of nonhomologous recombination. An efficient method for targeted gene disruption has been developed. Cells with substitution of exogenous sequences into a chromosomal locus were enriched, by a factor of 100, using a positive genetic selection that specifically selects for homologous recombination at the targeted site. The selection is based on the conditional expression of a dominant selectable marker by virtue of in-frame gene fusion with the target gene. The dominant selectable marker was derived by modification of the Escherichia coli neo gene so that it retains significant activity in mammalian cells after in-frame fusion with heterologous coding sequences. In the example presented here, homologous recombinants were efficiently recovered from a pool in which the targeted gene was disrupted in 1 per 10,000 cells incorporating exogenous DNA.

Biological, antigenic and physiochemical properties of these isolates are reported. USA M-2268a was selected as the reference strain. This strain was identical by complement-fixation and neutralization tests to Whitneys C. gapperie virus (USA 64-7855) from New York State and was related to, but distinct from, an unpublished agent (Johnson's Microtus montanus enterovirus USA M-1146) isolated in June, 1962 from voles trapped in Klamath County, Oregon. USA M-2268a was resistant to lipid solvents and acid pH and was stable at temperatures of 4 C, 22 C, and 37 C. Virus was detected over a 10-day observation period in four species of mosquitoes inoculated with USA M-2268a, although there was no evidence of infection or replication, and transmission attempts by bite failed. Neutralizing antibody was detected in C.g. gapperi and C. g. ochraceus in various habitats throughout the state.

11744428|t|Pattern and persistence of the epitope-specific IgM response against human cytomegalovirus in renal transplant patients.
11744428|a|The humoral immune response against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was evaluated in immunocompromised patients by Western blotting (WB) based on recombinant viral envelope (gB and gH) and tegument (pp150 and pp65) proteins. Three groups of patients were investigated: (a) 74 renal transplant recipients; (b) 24 hemodialysis patients, both groups without clinical evidence of viral infections; and (c) 19 renal transplant patients with manifest HCMV infections. The results obtained suggest that (i) the WB is considerably more sensitive, recognizing the HCMV-specific IgM response rather than the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. An IgM response was detected in one-third of all clinically asymptomatic renal patients. (ii) The virus-specific IgM response is primarily directed against the pp150 epitope. (iii) In patients with clinically manifest HCMV disease, additional IgM reactivities are most frequently directed against the glycoprotein B epitope. (iv) The severity of HCMV infections correlates with the extent of the IgM antibody response, i.e. with the number of specific epitopes involved. (v) After transplantation, IgM reactivity and its epitope-specific pattern persist for years.

1358740|t|Endotoxin-induced alterations in rat colonic water and electrolyte transport.
1358740|a|This study examines the effects of endotoxin on intestinal water and electrolyte transport in adult male rats. Endotoxin (1.55 mg/kg, intravenously) reduced in vivo colonic saline absorption 61% in 1 hour. In vitro unidirectional and net 22Na and 36Cl fluxes showed that endotoxin significantly decreased net colonic 22Na absorption compared with control colons (0.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.1 microEq/h x cm2). Although endotoxin had no significant effect on basal short circuit current (Isc) and conductance, 3H-inulin flux studies suggested an increase in colonic permeability. Isc responses to the 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent secretagogues prostaglandin E2 (1 mumol/L) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (0.1 mumol/L) were diminished by 80% and 50%, respectively. However, cytosolic cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity under basal and stimulated (6 mumol/L 8-bromo-cAMP) conditions was not altered by endotoxin treatment. The Isc responses to 10 mumol/L bethanechol, a Ca(2+)-dependent agonist, were not effected by endotoxin treatment. It was concluded that endotoxin significantly affects colonic transport function and may contribute to the development of diarrhea in inflammatory bowel diseases.

7959397|a|This study explored the effects of perceived social support from friends, family, and spouses on the psychological adjustment of 135 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. Initial data analyses revealed moderate correlations between greater psychological distress and lower levels of social support. However, when the personality variable of social desirability was controlled for, the relationship between social support and well-being were substantially weakened or eliminated. It is concluded that characteristics of the person, rather than of the situation, underlie the apparent relationship between social support and adjustment to illness. Social workers are advised to make in-depth assessments of ego strengths and past psychological functioning as better predictors of patient adaptation to disease.

8984023|t|Developmental differences in the expression of the cholera toxin sensitive subunit (Gs alpha) of adenylate cyclase in the rat small intestine.
8984023|a|BACKGROUND: The stimulatory guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein alpha subunit (Gs alpha) of adenylate cyclase is the target protein for cholera toxin. AIMS/METHODS: The expression of this signal transducer was analysed in the small intestine of developing rats by RNA transfer (northern blot) analysis by immunoblotting, and by ADP-ribosylation of membrane proteins. RESULTS: Intestinal Gs alpha mRNA (about 1.9 kb) was increased in the neonate compared with the adult rat. Two isoforms of Gs alpha proteins, a 45,000 and a 52,000 form, were expressed in the small intestinal epithelial cell and both were ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin. A significant increase in the larger isoform (52,000) and in its ribosylation was noted in the 2 week old suckling compared with post-weaned older animals. The protein content or ribosylation of the smaller form (45,000) did not significantly change with age. CONCLUSION: These data show that a developmental decline of intestinal Gs alpha expression seems to be, in part, regulated at the mRNA level. An increased Gs alpha expression in the immature intestine may help to explain a previously reported, dose dependent increased adenylate cyclase response and an increase in fluid secretion to cholera toxin in neonates compared with adults.

7163270|a|1) A three generations family (44 live born individuals) was investigated concerning the occurrence of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. 2) Diagnosis was established with clinical data on skin bruisability, bleeding diathesis and ligamentary laxity, especially of the small joints. A striking feature was congenital clubfeet in 7 of 12 affected patients and in one premature baby that lived only 2 days. In 2 of 3 relatives who died abruptly with clinical signs of abdominal bleeding, autopsy demonstrated a ruptured right arteria iliaca communis. 3) Pulse wave velocity was decreased in severely affected patients and normal in mildly affected and in unaffected relatives. Lowered pulse wave velocity apparently objectivates the increased arterial wall distensibility of affected patients. 4) The occurrence of the syndrome amongst the children and grandchildren of one single affected ancestor yields ample evidence for autosomal dominant transmission in this family. 5) Collagen typing and ultrastructural examination were not performed as consent for skin biopsy was not obtained. 6) Further clinical investigation is going on to find out whether miscellaneous signs of abnormal connective tissue in eyes, ears, teeth and palmar fascia are inherent to the observed syndrome or not.

1383878|t|Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) blocks GABA-induced current in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons.
1383878|a|The effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced Cl- currents of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in primary culture were studied by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Bath application of 5 microM GABA evoked sustained inward and outward currents at membrane potentials of -60 mV and +30 mV, respectively, when the external and internal solutions both contained 142 mM Cl-. DMSO at concentrations of 0.3-3% (v/v) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the inward current induced by 5 microM GABA at -60 mV. DMSO at 3% inhibited the GABA-induced inward and outward currents at -60 mV and +30 mV to similar extents (54% and 53% of the control, respectively), but the time-course of inhibition of the outward current at +30 mV was much faster than that of the inward current at -60 mV. These results suggest that DMSO suppressed the currents by interacting with GABA receptor-Cl- channel complex protein rather than by affecting the lipid-bilayer of the cell membrane.

8973797|t|A re-examination of sex differences in axon density and number in the splenium of the rat corpus callosum.
8973797|a|Previous work from our laboratory reported a sex difference in axon number in the splenium of the adult rat corpus callosum. However, the cortical origin of the axons that were sampled is unknown and sex differences may exist in the topography of axons in this area. The present study revisits the issue of sex differences in axon number in the splenium. First, the topographical organization of axons in the splenium was investigated. Rats each received single intracortical injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The location of HRP labelled fibers in the corpus callosum was compared across the various injection sites. There is a rostrocaudal organization of axons in the splenium based on rostral to caudal cortical location that does not vary by sex. Second, visual axons, which comprise the posterior fifth (relative to overall length) of the corpus callosum in both sexes, were thoroughly sampled with electron microscopy. Significant dorsoventral and rostrocaudal variation in myelinated and unmyelinated axon density was found. While axon density varied to some extent depending on the sex of the animal, axon number calculations revealed no sex differences in total axon number. Males, however, had significantly more myelinated axons than females. Thus, sex differences in axon density in the adult rat splenium were regional and did not result in overall sex differences in axon number.

11595423|t|Involvement of gastrin in gastric secretory and protective actions of N-alpha-methyl histamine.
11595423|a|N alpha-methylhistamine (N alpha-MH) is one of an unusual metabolite of histamine that was found in Helicobacter pylori-infected stomachs and is believed to interact with specific histamine H(1), H(2) and H(3)-receptors to stimulate gastric acid secretion and gastrin release from isolated G-cells but the effects of N alpha-MH on gastric mucosal integrity have been little studied. This study was designed; (1) to compare the effect of exogenous N alpha-MH with that of standard histamine on gastric secretion and plasma gastrin levels in rats equipped with gastric fistula (series A); and (2) to assess the action of N alpha-MH on gastric lesions induced by 100% ethanol (series B) in rats with or without removal of antral portion of the stomach (antrectomy). Rats of series B were pretreated intragastrically (i.g.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) with N alpha-MH or histamine (0.1-2 mg/kg) 30 min prior to 100% ethanol (1.5 ml, i.g.) with or without: (1) vehicle (saline); (2) RPR 102681 (30 mg/kg i.p.), to block CCK-B/gastrin receptors; and (3) ranitidine (40 mg/kg s.c.) to inhibit histamine H(2)-receptors. The area of gastric lesions was determined planimetrically, gastric blood flow (GBF) was assessed by H(2)-gas clearance method and venous blood was collected for determination of plasma gastrin levels by radioimmunoassay (RIA). N alpha-MH and histamine dose-dependently increased gastric acid output (series A); the dose increasing this secretion by 50% (ED(50)) being 2 and 5 mg/kg i.g or i.p., respectively, and this effect was accompanied by a significant rise in plasma gastrin levels. Both, N alpha-MH and histamine attenuated dose-dependently the area of gastric lesions induced by 100% ethanol (series B) while producing significant rise in the GBF and plasma immunoreactive gastrin increments. These secretory, protective, hipergastrinemic and hyperemic effects of N alpha-MH and histamine were completely abolished by antrectomy, whereas pretreatment with RPR 102681 attenuated significantly the N alpha-MH and histamine-induced protection against ethanol damage and accompanying hyperemia. Ranitidine, that produced achlorhydria and a further increase in plasma gastrin levels, failed to influence the N alpha-MH- and histamine-induced protection and accompanying rise in the GBF. We conclude that (1) N alpha-MH stimulates gastric acid secretion and exhibit gastroprotective activity against acid-independent noxious agents in the manner similar to that afforded by histamine; and (2) this protection involves an enhancement in the gastric microcirculation and release of gastrin acting via specific CCK-B/gastrin receptors but unexpectedly, appears to be unrelated to histamine H(2)-receptors.

11228263|t|Leucine kinetics during simultaneously administered insulin and dexamethasone in preterm infants with severe lung disease.
11228263|a|The objective of this study was to determine whether insulin administration would prevent the well-documented catabolic effect of dexamethasone given to preterm infants with chronic lung disease. We studied leucine metabolism in 11 very-low-birth-weight infants before dexamethasone treatment and on d 2, 4, and 7 thereafter. During the first 4 d of dexamethasone, insulin was administered i.v. at a dose of 0.5 (n = 7) or 1.0 (n = 5) IU/kg/d. Leucine turnover was not significantly different between d 0 (337 +/- 41.3 micromol leucine/kg/h), d 2 (288 +/- 27.2 micromol leucine/kg/h), d 4 (302 +/- 22.1 micromol leucine/kg/h), and d 7 (321 +/- 21.2 micromol leucine/kg/h), and neither was leucine breakdown (272 +/- 21.9 micromol leucine/kg/h on d 0, 225 +/- 21.5 micromol leucine/kg/h on d 2, 231 +/- 21 micromol leucine/kg/h on d 4, and 242 +/- 17.6 micromol leucine/kg/h on d 7). Weight gain rates were significantly lower during the first week of dexamethasone treatment compared with the week before treatment or the second and third week. We conclude that during insulin and corticosteroid administration in very-low-birth-weight infants, no changes were observed in leucine kinetics in contrast to previous studies. The decrease in weight gain was not reversed.

10594850|t|So-called 'hybrid' lesion of desmoplastic and conventional ameloblastoma: report of a case and review of the literature.
10594850|a|So-called 'hybrid' lesion of ameloblastoma, which is composed of desmoplastic ameloblastoma and conventional follicular/plexiform ameloblastoma, is an unusual variant of ameloblastoma and only eight cases of 'hybrid' lesion have been published in the English literature. To enhance knowledge of this interesting tumor, we add a case of 'hybrid' lesion that occurred in the right mandible of a 48-year-old Japanese male. Radiographic examination disclosed a honeycomb appearance at the anterior alveolar region, combined with a unicystic radiolucency in the molar region of the mandibular body. Histologically, the former showed microscopic features of desmoplastic ameloblastoma and the latter those of follicular ameloblastoma with focal granular cell transformation. The lesion was enucleated with curettage of surrounding bone and the lesional cavity was marsupialized. Although tumor tissues reappeared at 3, 5, 7 and 14 months after the surgery, the patient has remained disease free for 11 years after the last vaporization by CO2 laser of the recurred tumor. Many more cases of 'hybrid' lesion are needed to clarify the clinicopathological, histopathological and biological characteristics of this interesting variant of ameloblastoma.

2657071|a|Monoclonal antibodies reactive with monocyte/macrophages were used to characterize the nature of epitheloid cells in Crohn's granulomas. Six micron continuous frozen sections were studied in 12 specimens. A series of monoclonal antibodies was used to stain sections by the avidin-biotin complex method. Epitheloid cells in Crohn's granulomas reacted with anti-25F9 and anti-HLA-DR antibodies, but did not respond to anti-Leu M1, anti-Leu M2, anti-Leu M3 nor anti-Leu M5 antibodies. These results suggest that epitheloid cells in Crohn's granulomas may be activated macrophages.

19238268|t|Cost drivers in total hip arthroplasty: effects of procedure volume and implant selling price.
19238268|a|Total hip arthroplasty (THA), though a highly effective procedure for patients with end-stage hip disease, has become increasingly costly, both because of increasing procedure volume and because of the introduction and widespread use of new technologies. Data regarding procedure volume and procedure costs for THA were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample and other published sources for the years 1995 through 2005. Procedure volume increased 61% over the period studied. When adjusted for inflation, using the medical consumer price index, the average selling price of THA implants increased 24%. The selling price of THA implants as a percentage of total procedure costs increased from 29% to 60% during the period under study. The increasing cost of THA in the United States is a result of both increased procedure volume and increased cost of THA implants. No long-term outcome studies related to use of new implant technologies are available, and short-term results have been similar to those obtained with previous generations of THA implants. This study reinforces the need for a US total joint arthroplasty registry and for careful clinical and economic analyses of new technologies in orthopedics.

10856295|t|Junctional adhesion molecule interacts with the PDZ domain-containing proteins AF-6 and ZO-1.
10856295|a|We have identified the PDZ domain protein AF-6 as an intracellular binding partner of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), an integral membrane protein located at cell contacts. Binding of AF-6 to JAM required the presence of the intact C terminus of JAM, which represents a classical type II PDZ domain-binding motif. Although JAM did not interact with the single PDZ domains of ZO-1 or of CASK, we found that a ZO-1 fragment containing PDZ domains 2 and 3 bound to JAM in vitro in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. AF-6 as well as ZO-1 could be coprecipitated with JAM from endothelial cell extracts, demonstrating the association of the endogenously expressed molecules in vivo. Targeting of JAM to sites of cell contacts could be affected by the loss of the PDZ domain-binding C terminus. Full-length mouse JAM co-distributed with endogenous AF-6 in human Caco-2 cells at sites of cell contact independent of whether adjacent cells expressed mouse JAM as an extracellular binding partner. In contrast, truncated JAM lacking the PDZ domain-binding C terminus did not co-distribute with endogenous AF-6, but was restricted to cell contacts between cells expressing mouse JAM. Our results suggest that JAM can be recruited to intercellular junctions by its interaction with the PDZ domain-containing proteins AF-6 and possibly ZO-1.

7654399|t|Wall motion abnormalities and late ventricular arrhythmia during the predischarge phase of acute myocardial infarction.
7654399|a|BACKGROUND: Left ventricular wall aneurysm is a complication of acute myocardial infarction which has been considered a precipitating factor of cardiac failure and ventricular arrhythmia. We have evaluated the relation between severe left ventricular wall motion abnormalities and ventricular arrhythmia. METHODS: During a two-year period 146 patients admitted to a coronary care unit with acute myocardial infarction were studied. Radionuclide angiography performed within the second and the fourth weeks was used to analyse phase and wall motility changes, and patients were divided into three groups: 1) Hypokinesia and/or akinesia localized to one segment: with no or slight changes in phase image--102 patients; 2) Aneurysm: left ventricular deformity with well-defined chromatic changes in phase image--19 patients; and 3) Dyskinesia and/or extensive akinesia of two or more segments: phase image with diffuse heterogeneous changes--25 patients. Ventricular arrhythmia was studied using Holter electrocardiography taken during the second week of acute myocardial infarction. Three rhythmic profiles were considered: no premature ventricular contractions--41 patients; with three or more than three premature ventricular contractions per hour--38 patients; repetitive premature ventricular contractions--20 patients. RESULTS: Premature ventricular contractions were absent in 31 (30%) of the patients with hypokinesia/localized akinesia vs 8 (42%) of the patients with aneurysm, and vs 2 (8%) of the patients with dyskinesia/extensive akinesia. Premature ventricular contractions were frequent (> or = 3/h) in 22 (22%) of the patients with hypokinesia/localized akinesia vs 4 (21%) of the patients with aneurysm (p = 0.35; NS), and vs 12 (48%) of the patients with dyskinesia/extensive akinesia (p=0.003). Repetitive premature ventricular contractions were present in 10 (10%) of the patients with hypokinesia/localized akinesia vs 2 (11%) of the patients with aneurysm, and vs 8 (32%) of the patients with dyskinesia/extensive akinesia (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the presence of aneurysm was not associated with a higher occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia, but patients with dyskinesia/extensive akinesia had a higher occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia, > or = 3 premature ventricular contractions per hour and repetitive premature ventricular contractions. Our results suggest that ventricular arrhythmia is related to functionally severe wall motion abnormalities, and not to anatomical discriminants. This finding leads us to suggest different electrophysiological mechanisms behind these two entities.

2435204|t|[Thrombopenia caused by pentosan polysulfate]
2435204|a|Two case-reports of thrombopenias induced by pentosane polysulfate (PSP) are reported. PSP may play a direct role in the genesis of the thrombopenia appearing between the 5th and 15th day of treatment, or a sensitizing role where the thrombopenia occurs quite rapidly following heparin treatment. The clinical complications are haematomas, arterial or venous thromboses and haemorrhages. The platelet aggregation test is always positive in the presence of PSP. The immunological origin is probable. Monitoring of the platelet count is recommanded with this treatment.

15966259|t|Effects of cable car ascent to 2700 meters on mean EEG frequency and event-related desynchronization (ERD).
15966259|a|In the Eastern Alps, the Dachstein massif with a height of almost 3000 m is an ideal location for investigating the effects of changes in altitude on the human body. A cable car allows an ascent within a few minutes to 2700 m, where the partial pressure of oxygen is about 550 mm of mercury compared to 760 mm at sea level. Ten healthy subjects performed a reaction time task at an altitude of 990 m and 2700 m. The subjects were instructed to perform a right hand index finger movement as fast as possible after a green light had flashed. The green light flashed 50 times. Simultaneously to the task, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The event-related desynchronization (ERD) analysis of the EEG data showed that changes in alpha ERD values are not significant, but event-related synchronization (ERS) values in the beta band decrease significantly from around 50 % to 10 %. Furthermore, the mean frequency of the beta band increased from 16.68 Hz to 16.81 Hz (p = 0.0019) with the ascent. The suppressed post-movement beta ERS at an altitude of 2700 m may therefore be interpreted as a result of an increased cortical excitability level when compared with the reference altitude of 990 m above sea level.

10072002|t|The alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen tension increases with temperature-corrected determination during moderate hypothermia.
10072002|a|Moderate hypothermia (32-33 degrees C) occurs in anesthetic practice. However, intrapulmonary gas exchange and the effect of temperature correction of blood gases on oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange have not been investigated in these patients. We investigated alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen tension (AaDO2) and arterial to end-tidal difference in carbon dioxide (Pa-ETCO2) during rewarming of eight ASA physical status I patients from hypothermia of 32 degrees C. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl/propofol. AaDO2 and Pa-ETCO2 were assessed by analyzing arterial blood gases and saturated water vapor pressure, uncorrected or corrected to actual body temperature. The respiratory quotient (RQ) was measured by calorimetry. After temperature correction of blood gases and water vapor pressure, the AaDO2 was significantly higher at 33 and 32 degrees C compared with 36 degrees C (56 +/- 13 and 64 +/- 14 vs 39 +/- 10 mm Hg; P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). The deterioration of pulmonary oxygen exchange was not detected if arterial blood gases and water vapor pressure were not corrected. The RQ did not change during moderate hypothermia compared with 36 +/-C. The temperature-corrected Pa-ETCO2 was not affected by hypothermia. We conclude that AaDO2 is increased during moderate hypothermia. This is only detected when water vapor pressure and arterial blood gases are corrected to actual body temperature. IMPLICATIONS: We investigated intrapulmonary oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange during moderate hypothermia (32 degrees C) in eight patients. If oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor pressure were corrected to actual body temperature, the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference was increased during hypothermia. The carbon dioxide tension difference and the respiratory quotient were unaffected by hypothermia.

18516844|t|[Vesicle cycle in mouse diaphragm motor nerve terminals]
18516844|a|In our research on mouse diaphragm muscles the dynamic of neurotransmitter secretion and synaptic vesicles recycling (exo-endocytosis cycle) at the long-term rhythmic stimulation (20Hz) are explored using an intracellular microelectrode registration and a fluorescent microscopy. It have been shown, thate change of end plant potentials (EPP) amplitude at the rhythmic training occurs in three phases: initial transient decrease, long amplitude stabilization (1-2 min)--the plateau and secondary slow decrease. After 3 minute stimulations the EPP amplitude recovery observed during several seconds. Loading the synaptic vesicle by fluorescent endocytic dye FM 1-43 had shown that the rhythmic stimulation results to gradual (during 5-6 mines) fluorescence decrease in NT, indicating the synaptic vesicle exocytosis. The quantum analysis of the electrophysiological data and their comparison to the fluorescent researches date has allowed to assume, that mouse motor nerve terminals are characterized by high rate of endocytosis and fast synaptic vesicle reuse (average recycling time about 50 sec) that can provide effective maintenance of synaptic transmission at long high-frequency activity. Sizes of ready releasable and recycling synaptic vesicle pools are quantitatively determined. It is assumed, that vesicle recycling occurs on a short fast way to inclusion in recycling pool. So, in the stimulation protocol that were used the synaptic vesicles from reserve pool remain unused. Thus in our conditions recycling pool vesicles cycle repeatedly without reserve pool release.

8242318|a|A study was performed to determine the in vitro response of the longitudinal smooth muscle layer (conjoined longitudinal coat) of the human and canal to cholinergic and adrenergic stimulation, and to compare this with similar features of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) and rectal smooth muscle. Tissue was obtained from abdominoperineal and anterior resection specimens, and strips of muscle mounted for isometric tension recording in superfusion organ baths. Both conjoined longitudinal coat and IAS strips generated and maintained spontaneous myogenic tension (mean(s.e.m.) 0.10(0.01) and 0.48(0.04) g per mg tissue respectively), whereas equivalent rectal smooth muscle did not. Stimulation of muscarinic (cholinergic) receptors caused contraction of strips from the conjoined longitudinal coat and rectal smooth muscle layers in a dose-dependent manner (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/l); however, IAS strips relaxed (10(-6)-10(-4) mol/l). Activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors in conjoined longitudinal coat and IAS strips produced concentration-dependent contraction (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/l). In comparison, rectal smooth muscle relaxed. All muscle layers relaxed in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. These data indicate that in the anal canal both the conjoined longitudinal coat and IAS are specialized sphincteric smooth muscles.

9282409|t|Using beta 2-stimulants in asthma.
9282409|a|Beta 2-selective adrenoceptor agonists (beta 2-stimulants) have been used for 30 years for the relief of symptoms in patients with all grades of asthma. They can also be used before activities likely to precipitate airway narrowing and are sometimes taken as regular treatment by patients with chronic asthma. The first beta 2-stimulants to be introduced were shorter-acting drugs such as salbutamol and terbutaline. The longer-acting beta 2-stimulants, salmeterol and eformoterol were developed more recently and their role in treating asthma is not yet fully defined. In this article we review the current place of beta 2-stimulants in asthma management.

10686707|t|Persisting misconceptions of Belgian physicians and nurses about cancer pain treatment.
10686707|a|In Belgium palliative hospices, palliative support teams in hospitals and palliative home care are well-developed. The author gave a lecture about pain treatment in palliative care and inquired after the knowledge and attitudes of 28 nurses and 45 physicians. A questionnaire containing questions about morphine and cancer pain treatment was completed by the attendees before and after the session. In the initial questionnaire the care-providers' attitudes towards palliative care and symptom control were included also. The Wilcoxon test revealed a significant difference in knowledge between the physicians and nurses before the session (p = 0.007). Afterwards knowledge had improved in both groups (p = 0.007) but a difference still remained (p = 0.007). This study reveals that continued education is mandatory. An oral presentation seems not ideal; interactive training with practical exercises might be more appropriate.

12729953|t|Melatonin synthesis in retina: circadian regulation of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase activity in cultured photoreceptor cells of embryonic chicken retina.
12729953|a|The key regulatory enzyme in melatonin synthesis is arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT). In vivo, AANAT activity in chicken retinal photoreceptor cells exhibits a circadian rhythm that peaks at night. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the temporal development of light/dark and circadian oscillations of AANAT activity in cultured retinal cells prepared from 6- and 8-day-old chicken embryos (E6, E8, respectively). Photoreceptor cells prepared from E6 retinas and incubated under a 14-h light/10-h dark (LD) cycle of illumination for 5-7 days displayed prominent daily fluctuations in AANAT activity on days 5 and 6 in vitro. However, when E6 cells, incubated for 5 days under LD, were transferred to continuous (24 h/day) darkness (DD) on day 6, no daily pattern of activity was observed. This result indicates that AANAT fluctuations were light-driven and not circadian at this stage. In contrast, cells prepared from E8 embryos and incubated under conditions identical to those for E6 cells displayed prominent rhythms of AANAT activity in both LD and DD, indicative of circadian control. To determine if circadian control of AANAT activity would develop in E6 cells incubated for a longer period of time to allow maturation, cells were incubated for 8 days in LD followed by 2 days in DD. AANAT activity in these cells was rhythmic in both LD and DD. In cells incubated in this manner, a 2-h light pulse in the middle of the subjective night suppressed AANAT activity, indicating that the enzyme activity in the cultured cells is acutely suppressed by light, as it is in vivo. These results indicate that the ability to express circadian regulation of AANAT activity is an intrinsic property of retinal cells that can develop in vitro. Development of light-dark regulation of AANAT activity appears to precede the circadian clock-control of enzyme activity.

12528121|t|Human scleroderma sera contain autoantibodies to protein components specific to the U3 small nucleolar RNP complex.
12528121|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether antifibrillarin autoantibodies in scleroderma patients are associated with autoantibodies to protein components specific for U3 small nucleolar RNP (U3 snoRNP). METHODS: Sera from 220 scleroderma patients were examined for antinucleolar autoantibodies (ANoA) and for antibodies to fibrillarin and the U3 snoRNP-specific proteins Mpp10 and hU3-55K. Clinical correlates were determined for the different autoantibody specificities. RESULTS: Fifty-nine of the 220 patients were positive for ANoA, and 31 of these patients were antifibrillarin positive. Anti-hU3-55K was found in 10 patients, all of whom were antifibrillarin positive. Twenty-nine patients had anti-Mpp10 antibodies; 23 of these were antifibrillarin positive and 6 were antifibrillarin negative. ANoA, including antifibrillarin, anti-hU3-55K, and anti-Mpp10, were associated with diffuse, rather than limited, systemic or localized scleroderma. Esophageal and lung involvement were more common in patients with antifibrillarin and anti-Mpp10 antibodies, and the highest frequency was in patients with anti-Mpp10 alone. CONCLUSION: Antifibrillarin autoantibodies are associated with autoantibodies to protein components specific to U3 snoRNP, particularly Mpp10. The prevalence of anti-Mpp10 antibodies in antifibrillarin-positive patients suggests that the U3 snoRNP particle is a source of immunogenic/antigenic material for the anti-snoRNP response in scleroderma. Autoantibodies to snoRNP components were more frequent in patients with diffuse scleroderma than in those with either the limited systemic or localized forms. The increased expression of these antibodies in patients with the more severe form of scleroderma, coupled with the observations that fibrillarin expression is positively linked to collagen expression in fibroblasts and that fibrillarin is overexpressed in scleroderma fibroblasts, suggests a source of snoRNP to initiate and maintain these autoantibody responses.

10499216|t|Quality of life in women with symptomatic HIV/AIDS.
10499216|a|Despite the increasing incidence of cases of human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection and of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in women, there is a serious lack of information about those women's quality of life (QoL). The purpose of this exploratory descriptive study was to describe QoL using an HIV-specific instrument (the HOPES) every 2 months over a 4-month period in a convenience sample of 44 women with symptomatic HIV/AIDS. Changes in physical, psychological, social, sexual dimensions, and overall QoL were evaluated along with the frequency of the most prevalent distressing items. The mean scores of the global QoL, physical and psycho-social summary scales were significantly different over the 4-month data collection period: quality of life improved. The most prevalent disruptions were in the psycho-social domain, including financial problems, worry about the family, distress about losing others from HIV, and worry about disease progression. The most prevalent physical disruptions included reduction in energy, difficulties with daily activities and frequent pain. Married women appeared to be more vulnerable to disruptions in QoL over time. In addition to the use of conventional disease-specific parameters for the ongoing follow-up of women with HIV/AIDS, the systematic use of a QoL assessment can provide a focused approach to monitoring problems and targeting interventions. Such an approach is especially important for nurses who assist women living with the symptoms of HIV/AIDS.

6432456|t|Pulmonary edema following relief of upper airway obstruction.
6432456|a|In six pediatric patients, pulmonary edema (PE) appeared on chest x-ray film following intubation for upper airway obstruction (UAO). In spite of the x-ray appearance of PE, there was generally no concomitant physiologic or clinical decline. Only one of the patients required positive airway pressure following intubation. We conclude that PE on chest x-ray film following intubation for UAO is not uncommon, and may not be a harbinger of clinical and/or physiologic deterioration.

476886|t|Evaluation of warning arrhythmias before paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia during acute myocardial infarction in man.
476886|a|In order to determine the relationship of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (PVT) to any antecedent (premonitory) ventricular arrhythmias during the early phases of acute myocardial infarctions, 24-hour Holter monitoring was begun on 52 male patients an average of 12.6 hours after the onset of prolonged chest pain that was documented as acute infraction. Twenty-four patients had PVT and 28 did not. We analyzed in detail the incidence of frequency of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), prematurity and pairing during the 10 minutes immediately preceding PVT from a continuous 10-minute rhythm strip. There was no positive correlation between PVT and the number or complexity of PVCs in the 10 minutes immediately before ventricular tachycardia. These findings suggest that there is no consistent pattern or frequency of ventricular arrhythmia that could be identified as premonitory for PVT during the immediate pre-PVT period, even during the acute phase of myocardial infarction in man.

17257867|t|Improved heteronuclear dipolar decoupling sequences for liquid-crystal NMR.
17257867|a|Recently we introduced a radiofrequency pulse scheme for heteronuclear dipolar decoupling in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance under magic-angle spinning [R.S. Thakur, N.D. Kurur, P.K. Madhu, Swept-frequency two-pulse phase modulation for heteronuclear dipolar decoupling in solid-state NMR, Chem. Phys. Lett. 426 (2006) 459-463]. Variants of this sequence, swept-frequency TPPM, employing frequency modulation of different types have been further tested to improve the efficiency of heteronuclear dipolar decoupling. Among these, certain sequences that were found to perform well at lower spinning speeds are demonstrated here on a liquid-crystal sample of MBBA for application in static samples. The new sequences are compared with the standard TPPM and SPINAL schemes and are shown to perform better than them. These modulated schemes perform well at low decoupler radiofrequency power levels and are easy to implement on standard spectrometers.

9171936|t|Evidence for a functional kit receptor in melanoma, breast, and lung carcinoma cells.
9171936|a|We sought to determine the functional significance of the c-kit receptor (Kit) in melanoma, breast carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To explore these issues, we first screened cell lines of each type for c-kit mRNA expression using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. We found that WM-39 melanoma cells, HTB-22 breast carcinoma cells, and A549 NSCLC cells all expressed c-kit mRNA. Of interest, all of these cells expressed the c-kit ligand, Steel factor (SF). We then assessed the functional significance of c-kit and SF expression by disrupting the gene's expression with antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) targeted to c-kit mRNA codons 1-6 and SF mRNA codons 2-7, respectively. Nonhybridizing sequences [sense (5) and scrambled (SCR)] were also employed as controls. WM-39, HTB-22, and A549 cells were exposed to ODN (approximately 25 microM) for 5-7 days. Downregulation of c-kit and SF mRNA, and c-kit protein was demonstrated in cells treated with AS ODN. Effects on viable cell growth were demonstrated by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) or 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4 -sulfophenyl)- 2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. In fact, c-kit antisense ODN inhibited the viable cell growth of A549 cells 66% and 79% compared to sense and untreated controls (P = .0003; P < .0001). Additionally, WM-39 cell growth was inhibited 48% and 21% (P < .0001, P < .03) and HTB-22 cell growth was inhibited 50% (P < .001) compared to sense and untreated controls. Viable cell growth was also significantly inhibited by SF AS ODN compared to S and SCR controls in all cell lines. These results demonstrate that WM-39, HTB-22, and A549 NSCLC cells all express the c-kit and SF protooncogenes and suggest that the encoded receptor and ligand are important for cell growth. By finding the presence, and functional importance, of both the receptor and ligand in these cells, this study suggests the existence of an autocrine loop growth mechanism worthy of further study.

15331117|t|The effect of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty on the nasality of voice.
15331117|a|We prospectively studied the effect of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) on several speech and vocal parameters in 15 patients. Preoperative, 1-month postoperative, and 6-month postoperative assessments were made. Specific parameters included maximum phonation time, mean speaking fundamental frequency, mean frequency perturbation, intensity, and nasalance. Psychoacoustic analysis included pitch, quality, rate, resonance, and loudness. The primary outcome measure was the nasality of voice. At the 1-month postoperative assessment, one patient exhibited mild hypernasality by psychoacoustic analysis and a mildly elevated measured nasalance. At 6 months, both the psychoacoustic hypernasality and the measure nasalance had normalized. Consequently, no subjects exhibited hypernasality at the final assessment. Although abnormalities by psychoacoustic analysis were exhibited by 3 subjects at the 6-month postoperative assessment, none could be attributed to the surgery, but rather to concurrent illnesses. This study adds further data and support that UPPP done in standard fashion does not result in significant changes in voice either by measured parameters or by clinical assessment. Although this study does not obviate the need for preoperative counseling of patients about the potential effect of UPPP on voice, they can be counseled that the risk of hypernasality after UPPP is low.

10734192|t|A further investigation and reappraisal of the thio effect in the cleavage reaction catalyzed by a hammerhead ribozyme.
10734192|a|We synthesized three types of 11mer substrate, namely the natural substrate S11O and the thio-substituted substrates S11 S pS and S11 R pS, in which the respective pro-S p and pro-R p oxygen atoms were replaced by sulfur, and subjected them to detailed kinetic analysis in the cleavage reaction catalyzed by a hammerhead ribozyme. In agreement with previous findings, in the presence of Mg(2+)or Ca(2+)ions the rate of ribozyme-catalyzed cleavage of S11 S pS was as high as that of S11O, whereas the corresponding rate for S11 R pS was nearly four orders of magnitude lower than that for either S11O or S11 S pS. However, the rate of the ribozyme-catalyzed reaction with each of the three substrates was enhanced by Cd(2+)ions. Such results have generally been taken as evidence that supports the direct interaction of the sulfur atom at the R p position of the cleavage site with the added Cd(2+)ion. However, our present analysis demonstrates that (i) the added Cd(2+)ion binds at the P9 site; (ii) the bound Cd(2+)ion at the P9 site replaces two Mg(2+)or two Ca(2+)ions, an observation that suggests a different mode of interaction with the added Cd(2+)ion; and, most importantly and in contrast to the conclusion reached by other investigators, (iii) the Cd(2+)ion does not interact with the sulfur atom at the R p position of the scissile phosphate either in the ground state or in the transition state.

9096313|t|Sodium salicylate induces apoptosis via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase but inhibits tumor necrosis factor-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase activation.
9096313|a|In a previous study, we demonstrated that sodium salicylate (NaSal) selectively inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of the p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases). Here we show that in normal human FS-4 fibroblasts NaSal inhibits TNF-induced activation of another member of the MAPK family, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase. c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation induced by interleukin 1 or epidermal growth factor was less strongly inhibited by NaSal. Unexpectedly, treatment of FS-4 cells with NaSal alone produced a strong activation of p38 MAPK and cell death by apoptosis. NaSal-induced apoptosis was blocked by the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-203580, indicating that p38 MAPK serves as a mediator of NaSal-induced apoptosis in human fibroblasts. Activation of p38 MAPK and the resulting induction of apoptosis may be important in the demonstrated antineoplastic actions of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

7723286|t|Acquired resistance to acute oxidative stress. Possible role of heme oxygenase and ferritin.
7723286|a|BACKGROUND: Prior administration of endotoxin has conferred resistance to tissue damage in a number of models of organ injury. The mechanisms by which this resistance is conferred are enigmatic. Recognizing that enhanced tissue oxidative stress may be a feature of endotoxin-associated injury and is present in many models of tissue injury, we questioned whether the beneficial effect conferred by endotoxin is dependent on the up-regulation of antioxidant defenses. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We employed the glycerol model of acute renal failure (Gly-ARF), a model in which oxidant damage occurs in the kidney and other organs as a result of rhabdomyolysis and hemolysis. Rats were pretreated with endotoxin 24 hours before, or at the time of, induction of Gly-ARF. Renal functional studies and assessment of renal antioxidant status were performed. The effect of prior treatment with endotoxin was also examined in models of methemoglobin-induced and ischemic ARF. RESULTS: Renal function was improved in rats pretreated with endotoxin but worsened in rats subjected to Gly-ARF and endotoxin simultaneously. Endotoxin induced heme oxygenase activity and ferritin content in the kidney but did not induce other antioxidant systems such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Treatment with a competitive inhibitor of heme oxygenase blocked endotoxin-induced protection on days 2 and 3, while markedly attenuating the protective effect on day 1. Pretreatment with endotoxin reduced renal injury induced by methemoglobin, but not ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance to injury conferred by endotoxin in Gly-ARF involves induction of an antioxidant response, consisting of increased heme oxygenase and ferritin synthesis. This coupled response allows degradation of heme as well as chelation of iron, thus decreasing oxidant-mediated tissue injury. This novel mechanism of endotoxin-induced resistance may be applicable not only to Gly-ARF but also to other models of tissue injury in which enhanced oxidative stress is implicated.

19043818|t|Long-term effects on the histology and function of livers and spleens in rats after 33% toploading of PEG-PLA-nano artificial red blood cells.
19043818|a|This study is to investigate the long-term effects of nanodimension PEG-PLA artificial red blood cells containing hemoglobin and red blood cell enzymes on the liver and spleen after 1/3 blood volume top loading in rats. The experimental rats received one of the following infusions: Nano artificial red blood cells in Ringer lactate, Ringer lactate, stroma-free hemoglobin, polyhemoglobin, and autologous rat whole blood. Blood samples were taken before infusions and on days 1, 7, and 21 after infusions for analysis. Nano artificial red blood cells, polyhemoglobin, Ringer lactate and rat red blood cells did not have any significant adverse effects on alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, amylase and creatine kinase. On the other hand, stroma-free hemoglobin induced significant adverse effects on liver as shown by elevation in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase throughout the 21 days. On day 21 after infusions rats were sacrificed and livers and spleens were excised for histological examination. Nano artificial red blood cells, polyhemoglobin, Ringer lactate and rat red blood cells did not cause any abnormalities in the microscopic histology of the livers and spleens. In the stroma-free hemoglobin group the livers showed accumulation of hemoglobin in central veins and sinusoids, and hepatic steatosis. In conclusion, injected nano artificial red blood cells can be efficiently metabolized and removed by the reticuloendothelial system, and do not have any biochemical or histological adverse effects on the livers or the spleens.

14656885|t|Transgenic rescue of GATA-1-deficient mice with GATA-1 lacking a FOG-1 association site phenocopies patients with X-linked thrombocytopenia.
14656885|a|Association of GATA-1 and its cofactor Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1) is essential for erythroid and megakaryocyte development. To assess functions of GATA-1-FOG-1 association during mouse development, we used the GATA-1 hematopoietic regulatory domain to generate transgenic mouse lines expressing a mutant GATA-1, which contains a substitution of glycine 205 for valine (V205G) that abrogates its association with FOG-1. We examined whether the transgenic expression of mutant GATA-1 rescues GATA-1 germ line mutants from embryonic lethality. In high-expressor lines we observed that the GATA-1(V205G) rescues GATA-1-deficient mice from embryonic lethality at the expected frequency, revealing that excess GATA-1(V205G) can eliminate the lethal anemia that is due to GATA-1 deficiency. In contrast, transgene expression comparable to the endogenous GATA-1 level resulted in much lower frequency of rescue, indicating that the GATA-1-FOG-1 association is critical for normal embryonic hematopoiesis. Rescued mice in these analyses exhibit thrombocytopenia and display dysregulated proliferation and impaired cytoplasmic maturation of megakaryocytes. Although anemia is not observed under steady-state conditions, stress erythropoiesis is attenuated in the rescued mice. Our findings reveal an indispensable role for the association of GATA-1 and FOG-1 during late-stage megakaryopoiesis and provide a unique model for X-linked thrombocytopenia with inherited GATA-1 mutation.

16439455|t|Adrenocorticotropin-dependent changes in SF-1/DAX-1 ratio influence steroidogenic genes expression in a novel model of glucocorticoid-producing adrenocortical cell lines derived from targeted tumorigenesis.
16439455|a|We established the first adrenocortical tumor cell lines with complete zona fasciculata (ZF) cell phenotype from tumors induced in transgenic mice by large T-antigen of simian virus 40 under the control of the aldose reductase-like akr1b7 gene promoter. Adrenocortical tumor cell lines produced high amounts of corticosterone and were responsive to ACTH. All genes that are supportive for glucocorticoid synthesis including cyp21a1 and cyp11b1 were expressed, and most of them were transiently up-regulated by ACTH at transcriptional level: stimulation culminated after 3-6 h and returned to basal levels after 24 h. Taking advantage of these cells, we have examined the effect of ACTH on DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on X-chromosome, gene 1) and SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1), two transcription factors known to respectively repress and activate adrenocortical steroidogenesis by acting on common target genes. According to their antagonistic activities, DAX-1 mRNA and protein levels were transiently down-regulated by ACTH, whereas those of SF-1 were stimulated, with kinetics paralleling those of steroidogenic genes expression, notably of two known SF-1 target genes, star and akr1b7. This suggests an essential role of SF-1/DAX-1 proteins ratio to achieve proper ACTH control of steroidogenic gene expression in cells derived from ZF. This was confirmed in mice adrenals, where repression of dax-1 gene and concomitant up-regulation of sf-1, star, and akr1b7 genes were observed in response to ACTH stimulation. In conclusion, using both unique differentiated cell lines and in vivo approaches, we provide the first evidence that hormonally induced changes in SF-1/DAX-1 ratio are part of the molecular arsenal of ZF cells to fine tune ACTH responsiveness.

2433658|t|Massive hemorrhage complicating age-related macular degeneration. Clinicopathologic correlation and role of anticoagulants.
2433658|a|Reported are 15 cases of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) complicated by massive subretinal and/or vitreous hemorrhage. Clinicopathologic correlation is presented in four of the seven cases studied histopathologically. Salient histologic findings include: subretinal and subretinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) fibrovascular scar in the posterior pole; discontinuities in Bruch's membrane with choroidal neovascularization; extensive hemorrhagic detachment of the RPE and sensory retina; and vitreous hemorrhage. In three cases, a choroidal artery, emerging from breaks in Bruch's membrane, had ruptured walls. The authors have reviewed the previously reported cases of AMD complicated by massive hemorrhage and found that 19% of the patients were taking Coumadin (warfarin) or aspirin treatment when the bleeding occurred. Forty percent had a positive history of systemic hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Although the occurrence of hypertension is expected in the aged population with AMD, use of anticoagulants or antithrombotics by such patients may predispose them to serious ocular hemorrhagic complications.

11238932|t|The winged-helix protein brain factor 1 interacts with groucho and hes proteins to repress transcription.
11238932|a|Brain factor 1 (BF-1) is a winged-helix transcriptional repressor that plays important roles in both progenitor cell differentiation and regional patterning in the mammalian telencephalon. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying BF-1 functions. It is shown here that BF-1 interacts in vivo with global transcriptional corepressors of the Groucho family and also associates with the histone deacetylase 1 protein. The ability of BF-1 to mediate transcriptional repression is promoted by Groucho and inhibited by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, suggesting that BF-1 recruits Groucho and histone deacetylase activities to repress transcription. Our studies also provide the first demonstration that Groucho mediates a specific interaction between BF-1 and the basic helix-loop-helix protein Hes1 and that BF-1 potentiates transcriptional repression by Hes1 in a Groucho-dependent manner. These findings suggest that Groucho participates in the transcriptional functions of BF-1 by acting as both a corepressor and an adapter between BF-1 and Hes1. Taken together with the demonstration that these proteins are coexpressed in telencephalic neural progenitor cells, these results also suggest that complexes of BF-1, Groucho, and Hes factors may be involved in the regulation of progenitor cell differentiation in the telencephalon.

12855243|t|Proton pump inhibitors as a risk factor for Clostridium difficile diarrhoea.
12855243|a|Clostridium difficile is the main infectious cause of colitis in hospital inpatients. The incidence is increasing, and it is associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and increased length of stay. The main risk factor is use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and antibiotic restriction is the most effective control measure. We carried out a retrospective case-control study to investigate whether use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) was an additional risk factor. PPI use within the preceding eight weeks was associated with an increased risk of C. difficile diarrhoea (odds ratio 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.2). Reduction of unnecessary PPI use may be an additional strategy to reduce the incidence of this infection.

1549369|t|Antisense RNA to the putative tumor-suppressor gene DCC transforms Rat-1 fibroblasts.
1549369|a|Allelic deletions involving chromosomes 18q occur in a significant number of colorectal cancers. Recently, a highly conserved gene called 'deleted in colorectal cancer' (DCC) has been identified on chromosome 18q. DCC has been postulated to be a colorectal tumor-suppressor gene. In order to understand the role of DCC in cell transformation, we have established a stable Rat-1 cell line expressing dexamethasone-inducible DCC antisense RNA. High levels of dexamethasone-inducible DCC antisense RNA were detected in the Rat-1 transfectants. The antisense DCC-expressing Rat-1 cells showed a faster growth rate, anchorage independence and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Exposure of the parental Rat-1 cells to antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides to DCC resulted in inhibition of cell adhesion to the substratum which could be abrogated by various extracellular matrices. On the other hand, a bone marrow-derived stromal cell line which does not express DCC showed no detachment from the substratum when treated with the antisense oligo to DCC. These results suggest that the DCC gene is involved in cell adhesion and provide the first direct biological evidence for the possible role of DCC as a tumor-suppressor gene.

4064257|t|The relationships of high energy phosphates, tissue pH, and regional blood flow to diastolic distensibility in the ischemic dog myocardium.
4064257|a|Myocardial ischemia due to increased oxygen demand (pacing tachycardia plus critical coronary stenoses) alters diastolic distensibility and relaxation more than ischemia of comparable duration due to coronary occlusion. To investigate the relationship between myocardial diastolic function and metabolism, we compared myocardial high energy phosphate content, tissue pH, and regional blood flow for these two types of ischemia in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Myocardial biopsies were done with a high-speed air-turbine biopsy drill, permitting rapid (less than 1-second) freezing of tissue samples from both nonischemic and ischemic areas, while myocardial pH was measured with a hydrogen ion-selective polymer membrane implanted in the subendocardium. After 3 minutes of pacing tachycardia in dogs with critical coronary stenoses (demand-type ischemia, n = 14), regional systolic function (% segment shortening by ultrasonic crystals) was mildly depressed (from 19 +/- 2% control to 13 +/- 2% post-pacing, P less than 0.01), while left ventricular diastolic pressure-segment length relations shifted upward, indicating decreased distensibility of the ischemic myocardial segment. Associated with these changes in function, subendocardial adenosine triphosphate decreased (from 31.3 +/- 1.5 to 27.9 +/- 1.0 nmol/mg protein, P less than 0.01), as did creatine phosphate (53.8 +/- 2.1 to 39.6 +/- 2.5 nmol/mg protein, P less than 0.01), while myocardial pH declined slightly (delta pH = -0.14 +/- 0.02, P less than 0.01). In contrast, at 3 minutes of coronary artery occlusion (primary ischemia, n = 14), regional segment shortening was replaced by systolic bulging (% shortening decreased from 17 +/- 2% to -2 +/- 1% during occlusion, P less than 0.01), while left ventricular pressure-segment length relations were not shifted upward, and there was no decrease in diastolic distensibility of the ischemic segment. With coronary artery occlusion, subendocardial adenosine triphosphate declined slightly (33.2 +/- 0.5 to 29.2 +/- 2.0 nmol/mg, P less than 0.05), while creatine phosphate decreased substantially (51.1 +/- 2.3 to 7.8 +/- 1.4 nmol/mg protein, P less than 0.01). Myocardial pH fell strikingly (delta pH = -0.33 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.01), and the decline was 236% of that seen with demand-type ischemia. Regional myocardial blood flow (microsphere technique) showed a decreased endocardial:epicardial (endo:epi) ratio (1.04 +/- 0.04 control vs. 0.40 +/- 0.05 during pacing, P less than 0.01) and absolute subendocardial flow (1.02 +/- 0.47 to 0.47 +/- 0.05 ml/min per g, P less than 0.01) with demand-type ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

17668328|t|Employment and work among drug court clients: 12-month outcomes.
17668328|a|Employment contributes to drug abuse treatment success and is an important treatment outcome (Institute of Medicine, 1990). However, few tailored employment interventions are available. This project developed an employment intervention focused on obtaining, maintaining, and upgrading employment. The current study, approved by an IRB, uses 12-month outcomes to examine intervention dosage effects. Participants were 500 clients who entered two Kentucky drug court programs between March 2000 and November 2002. Measures included demographics, drug/alcohol use, criminality, employment, and education measures from the Addiction Severity Index (McLellan, Luborsky, Woody, and O'Brien, 1980) as well as specific employment measures. To examine the intervention, the number of intervention upgrading sessions attended was divided by the number of possible upgrading sessions. Session attendance percentages were then used to median split into a low upgrading group and a high upgrading group and were compared with the no intervention group. These three groups were used in a series of ANOVA and chi-square analyses to examine differences at 12-month follow-up. When employment, legal work, illegal work, and employment problems were examined for one year and 30 days at follow-up, there were significant effects for jobs in the past year, days worked at a legitimate job in both the past year as well as 30 days, and income from a legitimate job in the past year. Participants in the high upgrade group received maximum employment benefits. Since legal earnings increased and illegal earnings decreased, drug-user treatment programs and practitioners should assess and refer clients to employment interventions. Tailored employment interventions should be tested to keep drug users in treatment and to increase treatment outcome. The study's limitations are noted and future needed research is suggested.

3290181|t|New considerations in the pathogenesis of coagulase-negative staphylococcal foreign body infections.
3290181|a|Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the predominant cause of foreign body infections. The pathogenesis is related to the ability of these staphylococci to adhere to and grow on polymer surfaces and to produce an extracellular slime substance. The exact chemical nature of this extracellular slime substance is still not known, although there is some evidence that it may be a complex glycoconjugate. On the basis of in-vitro and animal data, the extracellular slime substance seems to interfere with various host-protective mechanisms and with the action of antistaphylococcal antibiotics. These factors can explain several clinical characteristics of coagulase-negative staphylococcal foreign body infections.

17931069|t|Toward a unified theory of homeopathy and conventional medicine.
17931069|a|INTRODUCTION: Could theoretical links exist between homeopathy and conventional medicine? In homeopathy, disturbance of the self-regulating Vital Force (Vf) results in dis-ease as multileveled symptom expression. Treatment aids the Vf as it attempts to restore holistic balance. Conventional medicine (allopathy) deterministically considers external agents (viruses, bacteria, etc.) or internal biochemical imbalances as disease causes. Treatment is geared to eradicating causative factors, sometimes at the expense of the homeostatic immune system. METHOD: A previous mathematical model described the Vf as a quantized gyroscopic "wave function," equating strength of symptom expression to degree of Vf gyroscopic "precession." Diseases and homeopathic remedies were interpreted respectively as braking and accelerating "torques" on Vf "angular momentum." In this paper, approximations applied to the Vf "wave function" could provide insights into why conventional medicine dismisses the action of highly potentized homeopathic remedies. In addition, a simple geometric force diagram provides another mathematical model for allopathic drug action and immune system reaction. RESULTS: The 2 models converge on the same result, delivering conventional biomedicine's conclusion: potentized homeopathic remedies should exert no clinically observable effects. CONCLUSIONS: Following the logic of these models, conventional medicine could be seen as a special case of a broader therapeutic paradigm also containing homeopathy.

9429126|t|Epilepsies with partial seizures in childhood.
9429126|a|Individual seizures are described as either partial (localization related) or generalized depending on whether a localized area of cerebral cortex is symptomatically involved sufficient to impart to the seizure a focal signature or whether sufficient cortex is involved sufficiently rapidly to appear as if generalized from the outset. This distinction is of some diagnostic and therapeutic importance. However, it has become evident that the prognosis of the patient's epilepsy is less a function of the seizure type than it is of the etiology and of the nature of the syndrome that the seizures represent. This approach is stressed in this chapter as is the regret that there is frequently a delay in the acknowledgment of the usefulness of a new drug in childhood epilepsies, as exemplified by lamotrigine.

2690569|a|The problem of the mechanisms of depression and action of the depressive drugs needs theoretical analysis and multichannel investigations. Animal models of depression are important for such investigations. Various neurochemical behavioral and psychological models were analysed in the present paper. Amygdalar model of depression seems to be one of the most important models. The effects of the treatment by amphetamine, imipramine and chlorpromazine on the amygdalar depressive syndrome in dogs were described. The individual differences were stressed, both in respect to forms of particular depression and to the sensitivity to drug treatment.

The examination of an experimental animal model for MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), has demonstrated that myelin basic protein (MBP)- or proteolipid protein (PLP)-specific T cells mediate the destruction of CNS myelin. In recent years, elegant studies in EAE have shown that encephalitogenic T cells recognize short peptides of MBP or PLP in the context of MHC/HLA-class II molecules, express a restricted number of T cell receptor (TCR) molecules and secrete interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha/beta. Understanding the pathogenetic steps in lesion development at the molecular level led to highly specific immunotherapies for EAE targeting each individual molecule. It has been the hope of many investigators that immunological events resembling those in EAE can be found in patients with MS and that the specific immunotherapies effective in EAE could also be applied to MS. However, to date, the evidence for a unique immunological abnormality in MS is not strong. Although MBP- and PLP-specific T cells with properties similar to those that are encephalitogenic in animals can be isolated from patients, they are not specific for MS and occur with similar frequency in controls. In addition, the variability in specificity and TCR usage has raised questions regarding the relevance of these cells in patients. The importance of the T cell responses to myelin antigens in MS may not be established until the effects of abrogating their activity through specific therapies targeting the trimolecular complex (TMC) have been demonstrated. Consequently, attention has begun to focus on modifying the biology of the MS lesion rather than targeting the initiating event at the level of the TMC, and the success of this approach is reflected by the effect of interferon-beta on lesion development in MS. The recent approval for the use of interferon-beta for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS has raised great interest in examining novel strategies for immunotherapies in MS. The basic concepts as well as the current candidates for such new immunotherapies will be outlined in this short review.

9826125|t|Expression of osteopontin in Meckel's cartilage cells during phenotypic transdifferentiation in vitro, as detected by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical analysis.
9826125|a|The localization of osteopontin (OP) was examined in Meckel's cartilage cells that bipotentially expressed cartilage and bone phenotypes during cellular transformation in vitro. Cultured cells were analyzed by in situ hybridization, immunostaining followed by light and electron microscopy, electron microscopy, and electron probe microanalysis. The combination of ultrastructural analysis and immunoperoxidase staining indicated that OP-synthesizing cells were cells that were autonomously undergoing a change from chondrocytes to bone-forming cells at the top of nodules. Double immunofluorescence staining of 2-week-old cultures revealed that OP was first synthesized by chondrocytic cells at the top of nodules. After further time in culture, the distribution of OP expanded from the central toward the peripheral regions of the nodules. Electron probe microanalysis revealed that the localization of OP was associated with matrices of calcified cartilage and osteoid nodules that contained calcium and phosphorus. Immunoperoxidase electron microscopy revealed that, in addition to the intracellular immunoreactivity in chondrocytes and small round cells that were undergoing transformation, matrix foci of calcospherites and matrix vesicles, in particular, included growing crystals that were immunopositive for OP. An intense signal due to mRNA for OP in 3-week-old cultures was detected in nodule-forming round cells, while fibroblastic cells, spreading in a monolayer over the periphery of nodules, were only weakly labeled. These findings indicate that OP might be expressed sequentially by chondrocytes and by cells that are transdifferentiating further and exhibit an osteocytic phenotype, and moreover, that expression of OP is closely associated with calcifying foci in the extracellular matrix.

9819771|t|Scanning electron microscopic and cytochemical analyses of alveolar and peritoneal macrophages of mice, dogs and cats.
9819771|a|Alveolar and peritoneal macrophages (MPs) of mouse, dog and cat were compared in relation to their scanning electron microscopic features and the lysosomal activities of nonspecific esterase, acid phosphatase, and beta-glucuronidase. The long spindle shape of peritoneal MPs differed from the spherical form of alveolar MPs in all species. There was no difference in the morphological findings among the three animals. Murine alveolar and peritoneal MPs were strongly positive for all three enzymes. Canine and feline alveolar and peritoneal MPs were strongly positive for acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase, but weakly positive for nonspecific esterase. These results strongly suggest that acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase can be used as markers of the MPs in healthy dogs and cats.

2174309|t|Elevated plasma noradrenaline concentrations in patients with low-output cardiac failure: dependence on increased noradrenaline secretion rates.
2174309|a|1. Plasma noradrenaline concentrations are elevated in patients with congestive heart failure; however, the pathogenesis of these elevated noradrenaline levels is controversial. 2. Possible mechanisms for elevated noradrenaline concentrations in patients with congestive heart failure include increased noradrenaline secretion, decreased clearance of noradrenaline, and a combination of increased secretion and decreased clearance. 3. In the present study, plasma noradrenaline clearance and apparent secretion rates were determined using a whole-body steady-state radionuclide tracer method in six otherwise healthy patients with moderate degrees of low-output cardiac failure and in six normal control subjects. 4. The venous plasma noradrenaline level was elevated in the patients with congestive heart failure as compared with the control subjects (4.18 +/- 1.34 versus 1.54 +/- 0.16 nmol/l, P less than 0.05). There was no stimulation of the adrenal medulla as evident by normal plasma adrenaline levels in both groups (0.19 +/- 0.04 versus 0.18 +/- 0.02 nmol/l, not significant). The apparent secretion rate of noradrenaline was elevated in the patients with congestive heart failure (4.75 +/- 1.95 versus 1.78 +/- 0.18 nmol min-1 m-2, P less than 0.05), whereas the clearance rate of noradrenaline was similar in the two groups (1.26 +/- 0.27 versus 1.16 +/- 0.02 l min-1 m-2, not significant). 5. We conclude that the high peripheral venous plasma noradrenaline concentrations in patients with mildly decompensated low-output cardiac failure are initially due to increased secretion, rather than to decreased metabolic clearance, perhaps in response to diminished effective arterial blood volume.

9669570|t|Do general internal medicine fellows find jobs that match their training?
9669570|a|We surveyed employers of general internists at teaching hospitals to determine whether they prefer that new hires are graduates of general internal medicine (GIM) fellowships. We surveyed former GIM fellows who graduated between 1988 and 1994 to determine whether they found jobs with protected research time and whether the positions they found matched their expectations. Employers rated a GIM fellowship, among other criteria, as important for clinician-researchers, but not for clinician-educators. For graduates categorized as clinician-researchers (with more than 33% of their time protected for research), there was a good match between their actual time allocations for research and clinical work and what they recalled their expectations were when looking for a job. Clinician-educators had a marked discordance between actual time allocations for research and clinical work and their recollection of their expectations when looking for a job.

16636667|t|ELAC2, a putative prostate cancer susceptibility gene product, potentiates TGF-beta/Smad-induced growth arrest of prostate cells.
16636667|a|Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) elicits a potent growth inhibitory effect on many normal cells by binding to specific serine/threonine kinase receptors and activating specific Smad proteins, which regulate the expression of cell cycle genes, including the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor gene. Interestingly, cancer cells are often insensitive to the anti-mitogenic effects of TGF-beta for which the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that the candidate prostate cancer susceptibility gene ELAC2 potentiates TGF-beta/Smad-induced transcriptional responses. ELAC2 associates with activated Smad2; the C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad2 interacts with the N-terminal region of ELAC2. Small interfering siRNA-mediated knock-down of ELAC2 in prostate cells suppressed TGF-beta-induced growth arrest. Moreover, ELAC2 was shown to specifically associate with the nuclear Smad2 partner, FAST-1 and to potentiate the interaction of activated Smad2 with transcription factor Sp1. Furthermore, activation of the p21 CDK inhibitor promoter by TGF-beta is potentiated by ELAC2. Taken together our data indicate an important transcriptional scaffold function for ELAC2 in TGF-beta/Smad signaling mediated growth arrest.

10100994|t|Cellular and biochemical response of the human lung after intrapulmonary instillation of ferric oxide particles.
10100994|a|Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was used to sample lung cells and biochemical components in the lung air spaces at various times from 1 to 91 d after intrapulmonary instillation of 2.6 microm-diameter iron oxide particles in human subjects. The instillation of particles induced transient acute inflammation during the first day post instillation (PI), characterized by increased numbers of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages as well as increased amounts of protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and interleukin-8 in BAL fluids. This response was subclinical and was resolved within 4 d PI. A similar dose-dependent response was seen in rats 1 d after intratracheal instillation of the same particles. The particles contained small amounts of soluble iron (240 ng/mg) and possessed the capacity to catalyze oxidant generation in vitro. Our findings indicate that the acute inflammation after particle exposure may, at least partially, be the result of oxidant generation catalyzed by the presence of residual amounts of ferric ion, ferric hydroxides, or oxyhydroxides associated with the particles. These findings may have relevance to the acute health effects associated with increased levels of ambient particulate air pollutants.

17407344|t|Bimodal swelling responses in microgel thin films.
17407344|a|A series of studies on microgel thin films is described, wherein quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been used to probe the properties of microstructured polymer thin films as a function of film architecture and solution pH. Thin films composed of pNIPAm-co-AAc microgels were constructed by using spin-coating layer-by-layer (scLbL) assembly with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) as a polycationic "glue". Our findings suggest that the interaction between the negatively charged microgels and the positively charged PAH has a significant impact on the pH responsivity of the film. These effects are observable in both the optical and mechanical behaviors of the films. The most significant changes in behavior are observed when the motional resistance of a quartz oscillator is monitored via QCM experiments. Slight changes to the film architecture and alternating the pH of the environment significantly changes the QCM and SPR responses, suggesting a pH-dependent swelling that is dependent on both particle swelling and polyelectrolyte de-complexation. Together, these studies allow for a deeper understanding of the morphological changes that take place in environmentally responsive microgel-based thin films.

6747345|t|In vitro and in vivo neutralizing activity of human colostrum and milk against purified toxins A and B of Clostridium difficile.
6747345|a|The neutralizing activity (NA) of supernates of colostral samples collected postpartum from 55 women and tested against a 50% cytopathic dose of purified toxins A and B of Clostridium difficile was evaluated in Y1 adrenal cells. Thirty-one (56%) of the samples had NA against one or both toxins. Samples of breast milk were collected postpartum from five women-three had colostral NA and two did not. All milk specimens from the three women with colostral NA had NA titers of 1:1-1:4 throughout the study (609 days in one case). Samples from the two women without colostral NA did not exhibit NA during a 60-day follow-up period. In suckling mice either toxin plus human milk with in vitro NA elicited significantly less fluid accumulation than did toxin plus diluent or toxin plus milk without in vitro NA (P less than .025 to P less than .05). Twelve (63%) of 19 milk samples with in vitro NA against toxin A and 15 (65%) of 23 with in vitro NA against toxin B inhibited fluid accumulation caused by the corresponding toxin. In vitro NA against toxin A appeared to reside in the secretory IgA fraction of one milk sample assessed by immune precipitation. The results suggest that human milk may protect newborn infants against toxins A and B of C. difficile.

6703063|t|Water-permeable and -impermeable barriers of snake distal tubules.
6703063|a|Isolated perfused snake distal tubules transport Na from lumen bath via an amiloride-sensitive transport pathway. Elevation of the luminal Na concentration from 16 to 150 mM leads to non-steady-state electrical behavior and cell swelling. To elucidate the mechanism of cell swelling, the water permeabilities of the epithelium and its apical and basolateral membrane were assessed. Distal tubules were found to be virtually impermeable to transepithelial water flow. Hydraulic conductivity measured 1.2 X 10(-7) cm3 X s-1 X cm-2 X atm-1 in the absence or presence of vasopressin. Effects of transepithelial osmotic pressure gradients on epithelial cell volume revealed the luminal membrane as the water-impermeable cellular barrier and the basolateral membrane as a barrier that is freely permeable to water. Epithelial cell swelling was blocked during perfusion with 150 mM Na when the perfusate also contained amiloride (10(-5) M). These results support the hypothesis that, in the case of transepithelial transport in the presence of high luminal Na concentrations, Na entry across the apical membrane exceeds Na extrusion across the basolateral membrane. Hence, the cells accumulate solute: Na from the apical side and some anion from the apical and/or serosal side. Concomitantly, the epithelial cells swell as water enters across the highly permeable basolateral membrane.

9744716|a|This paper contains a review of the impact of health economics on health policy in England during the past 25 years. Some health economists have expressed disappointment with the scale of the impact that health economics has had on policy but the record set out below suggests that there is modest cause for celebration. That is not to say that there is cause for complacency. There is still a long way to go before all important health policies are based on sound economics reasoning and evidence. The paper begins with some definitions and background; it covers nine areas of health policy, and health policy making, where past impacts of health economics have been postulated; it covers briefly the reciprocal impact of health policy on health economics; and it concludes with a discussion about the findings.

9576970|t|Chlorophyll a availability affects psbA translation and D1 precursor processing in vivo in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
9576970|a|Transcript accumulation and translation of psbA as well as processing of the D1 precursor protein were investigated in relation to chlorophyll availability in vivo in cyanobacterial strains lacking photosystem I (PS I). The psbA transcript level was almost independent of chlorophyll availability and was approximately 3-fold lower in darkness than in continuous light (5 microE m-2 s-1). Upon illumination, it reached a steady-state level within several hours. Upon growth under light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions (LAHG) in the PS I-less strain, D1 synthesis occurred immediately upon illumination. However, in PS I-less/chlL- cells, which lacked the light-independent chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and had very low chlorophyll levels after LAHG growth, very little D1 synthesis occurred upon illumination, and the synthesis rate increased with time. This result suggests a translational control of D1 biosynthesis related to chlorophyll availability. Upon illumination, initially a high level of the nonprocessed D1 precursor was observed by pulse labeling and immunodetection in LAHG-grown PS I-less/chlL- cells but not in PS I-less cells. A significant amount of the D1 precursor eventually was processed to mature D1, and the half-life of the D1 precursor decreased as the chlorophyll content of the cells increased. The D1 processing enzyme CtpA was found to be present at similar levels regardless illumination or chlorophyll levels. We conclude that, directly or indirectly, chlorophyll availability is needed for D1 translation as well as for efficient processing of the D1 precursor.

15548236|t|Cardiovascular and survival effects of sympatho-inhibitors in adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats.
15548236|a|Adriamycin (ADR) is a widely used drug for the treatments of cancers. This study evaluates the effects of moxonidine and metoprolol on cardiac hemodynamics and survival in ADR-induced left ventricular dysfunction (total dose of 20 mg/kg in a 4-week regimen). Rats were treated with the centrally acting I(1)R agonist sympatho-inhibitor, moxonidine, or with the non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist, metoprolol, during 1 month or until death. Treatments began 1 week after the onset of the ADR administration. Low doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day) of moxonidine and metoprolol (10 mg/kg/day) improved cardiovascular function. High doses of moxonidine (3 mg/kg/day) and metoprolol (150 mg/kg/day) were cardiodepressive. Moxonidine and metoprolol both failed to improve survival. These data indicate that a treatment with these sympatho-inhibitors can reduce the left ventricular dysfunction induced by ADR. Moreover, these cardioprotective effects where obtained even when ADR was used at a dose regimen usually employed for its antineoplastic effects in rodents. Nevertheless, in this particular cardiomyopathy, we did not find any association between improvements of functional parameters and survival whatever the drug and the dose used. This problem points out the difficulty to prevent, at least with sympatho-inhibitory drugs alone, the mortality linked to the chronic cardiotoxicity of ADR.

7729166|a|From 1970 to 1986 a total of 4578 hip fractures were registered in persons > or = 40 years in a Danish urban municipality. During that period, the annual number almost tripled. The statistical analysis revealed an increase in the age-specific incidence for both females and males (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the number of fractures increased due to demographic aging. The overall incidence for individuals > or = 40 years increased 9-10% annually; from 2.1 to 5.4 per 1.000 females, and from 0.9 to 2.1 per 1.000 males. The female:male ratio was 2.8 without changes over time. If the observed increase in incidence is extrapolated to the next 17 years, a doubling of the annual number of fractures is predicted by the year 2002, whereas an unchanged incidence would result in a 20% increase in number.

10969505|t|Efficacy and safety of methotrexate therapy for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
10969505|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) can result in disability, growth disturbance, and systemic complications. This study investigated the efficacy and adverse effects of oral methotrexate (MTX) therapy in Taiwanese children with JRA. METHODS: The medical records of 52 Taiwanese children with JRA treated with oral MTX were retrospectively analyzed. The disease onset was polyarticular in 22 children, oligoarticular in 13, and systemic in 17. The indication for MTX therapy was lack of efficacy of previous drugs, including two or more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, in all patients. In addition, three patients had received hydroxychloroquine and one had received sulfasalazine, without improvement. Corticosteroid dependency had developed in 27 patients prior to MTX therapy. The mean initial dose of MTX was 9.1 mg.m-2.wk-1 (range, 5-20 mg.m-2.wk-1), and the mean maximal dose was 10.2 mg.m-2.wk-1 (range, 5-20 mg.m-2.wk-1). The mean duration of treatment was 23 months (range, 6-96 mo), and the mean duration of follow-up was 52 months (range, 10-123 mo) from the start of MTX therapy. RESULTS: Thirty-six children (69%) showed clinical improvement and 25 children (48%) achieved clinical remission. The administration of MTX resulted in more than a 50% reduction in required corticosteroid dosage in six children, and complete discontinuation of corticosteroid in 10 children. MTX was discontinued in 18 patients following a mean of 8 months (range, 2-34 mo) of clinical remission. Relapse occurred in nine (50%) of these patients. Thirteen patients (25%) suffered from adverse effects associated with MTX treatment. All of these adverse effects resolved spontaneously, or subsided within 4 weeks following dosage reduction or discontinuation of MTX. CONCLUSIONS: Oral MTX therapy is effective and well-tolerated in Taiwanese children with JRA. It can serve as the first choice of second-line therapy in JRA.

To find the intrinsic value of these plants for the development of H. virescens populations, we fed different laboratory and wild colonies with fresh and lyophilized plant tissue under a constant temperature. Development time of this insect under laboratory conditions varied up to 10 d between plant hosts and was dependent on the type of plant tissue provided: fresh or lyophilized. Life table parameters such as net reproductive rate, finite rate of increase, and generation time indicated that Trifolium repens, a wild host growing around agricultural fields year round, could be one of the most suitable local plant hosts for the development of H. virescens. Two species of Geranium, previously reported as the source of the first H. virescens generation in the region, had lower intrinsic value as a food source than did T. repens. Gossyipium hirsutum, perhaps the most important crop source of H. virescens in the region, produced low net reproductive rate and finite rate of increase parameters. Sampling conducted in agricultural fields during 2006 and 2007 found no larvae on the above mentioned wild hosts as it was previously reported. Results indicated that H. virescens populations in this region were not supported by the wild plant species growing around agricultural fields during the time when the survey took place.

2078638|a|The effects of electron donors and acceptors on O2 binding by hemoglobin were studied. 2,4-Dinitrophenol, levomycetin and pelargonidine-3,5-diglycoside which act as electron acceptors in free radical reactions, enhance this process. In contrast, N-propylajmalin which is known to be an electron donor in the above reactions, suppresses the O2 binding. Diphosphoglycerate and inositol hexaphosphate, the natural inhibitors of O2 binding, exhibit, similar to N-propylajamlin, the properties of electron donors, the latter being a more potent electron donor than the former.

16435122|a|DNA methylation/demethylation pattern, determined by 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC) immunostaining, was evaluated in porcine "in vivo" produced embryos from zygote up to the blastocyst stage. In one-cell stage embryos, only the maternal pronucleus showed a positive labeling whilst the paternal pronucleus showed almost no labeling. The intensity of labeling is high until the late morula stage. Blastocysts containing less than 100 cells showed the same intensity of labeling in both the inner cell mass (ICM) nuclei and the trophectodermal (TE) cell nuclei. Interestingly, with further cell multiplication, cells of the ICM became more intensively labeled when compared to TE cells. This distinct methylation pattern is even more profound in blastocysts containing about 200-300 cells and is not caused by the difference in the cell volume of ICM and TE cells.

8945035|t|Single lead DDD system: a comparative evaluation of unipolar, bipolar, and overlapping biphasic stimulation and the effects of right atrial floating electrode location on atrial pacing and sensing thresholds.
8945035|a|Single lead DDD pacing using unipolar or bipolar stimulation is limited by high atrial threshold. Overlapping biphasic (OLBI) waveform stimulation via atrial floating ring electrodes may preferentially enhance atrial pacing and avoid diaphragmatic pacing. Single lead DDD pacing with OLBI atrial pacing was studied in 12 patients (6 men and 6 women; mean age 74 +/- 7 years) with complete heart block. At implantation, atrial bipolar rings (area 27 mm2, separation 10 mm) were positioned at radiological defined high, mid, and low right atrial (RA) levels, and P wave amplitude and atrial and diaphragmatic pacing thresholds were determined in each position using unipolar, bipolar, and OLBI stimulation in random order. Although statistically insignificant, both the maximum and minimum sensed P wave amplitudes tended to be lower in the low RA position. Independent of the stimulation modes, minimum atrial pacing threshold occurred in the mid-RA. At mid-RA, the atrial pacing threshold was significantly lower with OLBI pacing compared with either unipolar or bipolar mode (3.9 +/- 2.2 V vs 6.7 +/- 3.5 V and 6.9 +/- 3.5 V, P < 0.05). Although the diaphragmatic thresholds were similar, OLBI pacing modes in the mid-RA and final location significantly improved the safety margin for avoidance of diaphragmatic pacing compared with unipolar mode. There was no correlation between atrial pacing and sensing threshold. At predischarge testing, all but one patient who developed atrial fibrillation had satisfactory atrial capture and a stable atrial pacing threshold (day 0: 2.6 +/- 1.1V vs day 2:3.2 +/- 1.3V, P = NS). However, diaphragmatic pacing occurred in four of 11 (36%) patients, especially in the upright position (sitting and standing). Our preliminary clinical results suggest that OLBI pacing via atrial floating ring electrodes can reduce the atrial pacing threshold. To optimize atrial pacing and sensing, the bipolar electrodes should be located at the mid-RA level first, although the high RA is an alternative. Despite significant improvements in the safety margin for diaphragmatic pacing with OLBI pacing, diaphragmatic stimulation remains a clinical problem.

7023862|t|Bronchodilator effects of nebulized fenoterol: a comparison with isoproterenol.
7023862|a|In an attempt to find the optimal single therapeutic dose of fenoterol inhalant solution administered by compressor-powered nebulization, bronchodilator and side effects of five different doses of fenoterol (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg) and of placebo were compared with those of the recommended therapeutic dose delivered from a metered dose canister in 16 patients with reversible airway obstruction. The fenoterol (except for the metered dose) and the placebo were given in a double-blind, cross-over manner. In comparison with placebo, all doses of fenoterol produced a significant increase in average values of FEV1, FEF25-75%, FVC, and SGaw and decrease in FRC for five to eight hours. There was a trend for the bronchodilator action to become greater and more prolonged with increasing doses of fenoterol. Compared with 0.4 mg given from a metered dose canister, 0.5 mg of fenoterol delivered by compressor powered nebulization was equally effective in bronchodilator potency. Dose-by-dose comparison with isoproterenol indicates that fenoterol is a more potent and longer lasting bronchodilator and has no significant effect on heart rate and blood pressures. The most common side effects were shakiness or tremor of hands which appeared to be dose-related in terms of incidence and intensity. The results of the present study suggest that 0.5 to 1.0 mg of fenoterol is a suitable single therapeutic dose when administered by compressor-powered nebulization.

12269401|t|Effects of Shuanghuanglian and Qingkailing, two multi-components of traditional Chinese medicinal preparations, on human leukocyte function.
12269401|a|Qingkailing (QKL) and Shuanghuanglian (SHHL) are two commonly used Chinese herbal preparations with reported antiinflammatory activity. The effects of these two preparations on the capacity of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) to stimulate the production of cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) and chemokines (MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and MCP-1) by peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) was tested. We also evaluated their effect on LPS-stimulated NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in a THP-1 cell line, and on human monocyte chemotactic response to chemoattractants. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of QKL (0.1 to approximately 2%) and SHHL (6 to approximately 120 microg) significantly inhibited production of cytokines and chemokines in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Both, QKL at 1:100 and SHHL at 60 microg/ml, markedly inhibited RANTES, MIP-1alpha, SDF-1alpha and fMLP induced human monocyte migration (P < 0.05 or 0.01). QKL (1%) did not inhibit monocyte chemotaxis induced by super-or sub-optimal concentrations of fMLP (10(-5), 10(-6) and 10(-10) M), but only inhibited chemotaxis induced by optimal concentrations of fMLP at 10(-7), 10(-8) and 10(-9) M. QKL (0.1% or 1%) and SHHL (6 or 60 microg/ml) markedly inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB activity in THP-1 cells. The results suggested that the pharmacological basis for the antiinflammatory effects of QKL and SHHL is the result of suppression of NF-kappaB regulated gene transcription, leading to suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine. Interference with leukocyte chemotaxis also contributes to the antiinflammatory and immunomodulating effects of these medicinals. Identification of the responsible components in these two herbal preparations may yield compounds suitable for structural modification into potent novel drugs.

6941302|a|A diffusion model of the modification of mutation rates at a heterotic locus in a finite population is examined. An asymptotic analysis assuming strong selection and weak linkage shows that selection can operate on mutation rates in this setting. There exists a favored mutation rate which is a function only of the equilibrium allele frequency of the heterotic locus and the population size. It is independent of the strength of selection at the heterotoxic locus. Computer simulations are also provided to show that this form of natural selection can occur.

1999182|t|Regulation of the expression of the sex-specific isoforms of cytochrome P-450 in rat liver.
1999182|a|The hepatic metabolism of steroid hormones and of xenobiotics frequently depends on the expression of the sex-specific isoforms of cytochrome P-450 and on differences in sex hormones. Following biochemical, immunological and molecular biological investigations, it was shown that in adult rat liver there exist at least four male-specific and one female-specific isoforms of cytochrome P-450. The designation of these sex-specific genes is IIC11, IIIA2, IIC13 and IIA2 in males, and IIC12 in females. The irreversible programming of the expression of these isoforms of cytochrome P-450 in adulthood occurs during the perinatal period of life, and is named enzyme imprinting. One of the main factors that regulates the expression of the sex-specific isoforms of cytochrome P-450 is the level of androgens in the blood. Castration of adult rats decreased the level of the male isoforms of cytochrome P-450 and the activity of the monooxygenase enzyme system that remained higher than in intact females. The mechanism of enzyme imprinting can be explained as follows: neonatal androgens program the secretion of hypothalamic hormones, somatostatin and growth-hormone-releasing factor. These factors determine the type of growth hormone secretion in adult rats, and this controls the type of sex-specific isoforms of cytochrome P-450 expressed in adulthood. Metabolic regulation similar to that outlined above was shown to occur for several metabolism-dependent chemical carcinogens. Such a pathway may explain the different sensitivity displayed by male and female rats to treatment with these carcinogenic agents. One possible way of modulating the expression of some isoforms of cytochrome P-450 in adult rats is by treating neonates with specific xenobiotics that change the constitutive expression of neonatal androgens. It appears that this enzyme imprinting plays an important role in determining the individual sensitivity to the carcinogenic effects of chemicals.

17610405|t|The comparative plasma pharmacokinetics of intravenous cefpodoxime sodium and oral cefpodoxime proxetil in beagle dogs.
17610405|a|The pharmacokinetic properties of cefpodoxime, and its prodrug, cefpodoxime proxetil, were evaluated in two separate studies, one following intravenous (i.v.) administration of cefpodoxime sodium and the second after oral (p.o.) administration of cefpodoxime proxetil to healthy dogs. After cefpodoxime administration, serial blood samples were collected and plasma concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A single i.v. administration of cefpodoxime sodium at a dose of 10 mg cefpodoxime/kg body weight resulted in a cefpodoxime average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 91 (+/-17.7) microg/mL, measured at 0.5 h after drug administration, an average half-life (t1/2) of 4.67 (+/-0.680) h, an average AUC(0-infinity) of 454 (+/-83.1) h.microg/mL, an average V(d(ss)) of 151 (+/-27) mL/kg, an average Cl(B) of 22.7 (+/-4.2) mL/h/kg and an average MRT(0-infinity) of 5.97 (+/-0.573) h. When dose normalized to 10 mg cefpodoxime/kg body weight, cefpodoxime proxetil administered orally resulted in Cmax of 17.8 +/- 11.4 microg/mL for the tablet formulation and 20.1 +/- 6.20 microg/mL for the suspension formulation and an average AUC(0-LOQ) of 156 (+/-76.1) h.microg/mL for the tablet formulation and 162 (+/-48.6) h.microg/mL for the suspension formulation. Relative bioavailability of the two oral formulations was 1.04 (suspension compared with tablet), whereas the absolute bioavailability of both oral formulations was estimated to be approximately 35-36% in the cross-study comparison with the i.v. pharmacokinetics. Combined with previous studies, these results suggest that a single daily oral dose of 5-10 mg cefpodoxime/kg body weight as cefpodoxime proxetil maintains plasma concentrations effective for treatment of specified skin infections in dogs.

11798451|t|Evidence for abnormal middle cerebral artery values in patients with idiopathic hydramnios.
11798451|a|OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic hydramnios is an independent risk factor for perinatal morbidity and mortality, although the precise mechanism is unknown. Hydramnios may alter oxygen delivery to the human fetus. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) pulsatility index (PI) is a sensitive parameter for detection of blood flow redistribution or centralization. The aim of this study was to determine whether idiopathic hydramnios is associated with changes in the PI of the MCA and the umbilical artery (UA). DESIGN: The PI of the MCA and UA were determined prospectively in 113 consecutive pregnant women with singleton pregnancies and idiopathic hydramnios (study group) and in 113 matched control patients with normal amniotic fluid (AF) volume (control group). The control group was matched for maternal age, gravidity, parity and gestational age at examination. Hydramnios was defined as an AF index above 24 cm. Patients with fetal structural or chromosomal anomalies and with diabetes mellitus were excluded. A PI below the 5th centile for the MCA was considered abnormal. RESULTS: The rate of abnormal MCA PI was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group (30.9% (35/113) vs. 5.3% (6/113), respectively, OR 8.0; p < 0.0001; 95% CI 3.3-22.1). A significant inverse correlation was found between MCA PI and increasing AF index among patients with hydramnios (p = 0.008, r = 0.46). In contrast, there were no significant differences between the UA PI (0.93 (0.57-2.06) vs. 1.0 (0.49-1.48), (p = 0.20)) and MCA/UA (1.86 (0.77-2.01) vs. 2.15 (0.86-4.11), (p = 0.14)) in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations provide evidence of cerebral blood flow redistribution in fetuses with idiopathic hydramnios.

2439682|t|Dendrotoxin blocks potassium channels and slows sodium inactivation in Myxicola giant axons.
2439682|a|Dendrotoxin (DTX) is known to partially block delayed rectifier K+ channels and enhance neurotransmitter release, but no effects on Na+ channels have been reported. In voltage-clamped Myxicola axons DTX affected both the K+ and Na+ conductances. DTX blocked completely Myxicola K+ channels with a KD of 150 nM and induced slow K+ inactivation. DTX doubled the time constants for inactivation of conducting Na+ channels and gating charge immobilization without altering Na+ activation or the voltage- and time-dependent fast and slow Na+ inactivation induced by depolarizing prepulses. A selective effect on open Na+ channel inactivation provides additional evidence for kinetic models in which resting Na+ channels need not open before being inactivated.

2080664|t|Effect of leader primary structure on the translational efficiency of phosphoglycerate kinase mRNA in yeast.
2080664|a|In order to determine the effect of the nucleotide composition of the 5'-untranslated (leader) region on the translational efficiency of mRNA in yeast, we replaced a large part of the leader region of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene by various deoxyoligonucleotides of defined sequence. All mutations left the context of the transcription initiation site and AUG start codon intact. The mutant genes were introduced into yeast cells on a multicopy vector and the ratio of the steady-state levels of PGK mRNA and protein were determined. We found translational efficiency to be unaffected by the presence of either an 18 nucleotides (nt) long polyA or polyC tract or by sequences consisting of mixtures of A and C residues in any proportion. In contrast, a poly U tract, as well as mixtures of U and C residues, reduced translational efficiency by a factor of two to three, presumably by long-range base-pairing between the leader and sequences elsewhere in the coding or 3'-non-coding regions of the messenger. In agreement with this hypothesis, a five-fold reduction in translational efficiency was found for an mRNA carrying a polyC tract in the leader as well as a polyG tract in the trailer, neither of which had any effect on translational efficiency by itself. Therefore, we conclude that the leader and trailer regions (including the polyA tail) of PGK mRNA are sufficiently close to base-pair when containing complementary sequences. The resulting secondary structure evidently constitutes a barrier for incoming 40S subunits on their way to the AUG start codon. The presence of an 18 nt long polyG tract in the leader completely abolished translation of the PGK mRNA in accordance with earlier observations. However, we found that leaders containing up to 40% G residues interspersed with either A or U, still allow highly efficient translation. This value is about four times as high as the average G content of leader sequences in naturally occurring yeast mRNAs. Finally, neither deletion of about 40% of the trailer sequence of PGK mRNA, nor replacement of this sequence by homopolymer tracts had any effect on translational efficiency.

12389010|t|Providing research and research training infrastructures for clinical research in the reproductive sciences.
12389010|a|The Reproductive Sciences Branch of the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development has created pioneering new research and research training programs that address the impending shortage of physician-scientists in obstetrics, gynecology, and women's health and the need to bolster translational and clinical research. This article provides a brief overview of the Specialized Cooperative Centers Program in Reproduction Research, the National Cooperative Program for Infertility Research, the Reproductive Medicine Network, the Reproductive Scientist Development Program, the Women's Reproductive Health Research Career Development Program, and the Contraception and Infertility Research Loan Repayment Program and describes how these programs collectively create an infrastructure to promote the next generation of physician-scientists and to provide an information exchange between basic and clinical investigators. A key component in increasing the number of clinical investigators is the Contraception and Infertility Research Loan Repayment Program. This program has enabled clinicians to be involved in research without having to be concerned about educational loan debt. Other component programs provide basic/translational, clinical hypothesis-oriented research and clinical trials research infrastructure. The programs created are individually strong and collectively poised to support translational and clinical research efforts and to build a well-trained cadre of physician-scientists. The collective use of these types of programs is proposed as a model for the National Institutes of Health.

The observed increase in the number of cyst forms was influenced by the ratio of cysts to host cells in the inocula, duration of passage, and formulation of the cell culture media. Maximum growth was achieved by inoculating 1.3 X 10(5) cysts per 75-cm2 flask containing about 2 X 10(7) Vero cells (cyst-to-cell ratio=1:154) maintained on minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum.

18776713|t|Goshuyuto, a traditional Japanese medicine for migraine, inhibits platelet aggregation in guinea-pig whole blood.
18776713|a|The effects of goshuyuto and chotosan, traditional Japanese medicines, on collagen-induced platelet aggregation were examined using guinea-pig blood. Goshuyuto at the concentration of 1,000 mug/mL inhibited collagen-induced platelet hyper-aggregation to the same degree as aspirin at the concentration of 100 mumol/L, but chotosan did not. Goshuyuto is composed of four medicinal herbs. Of them, aqueous extracts of Evodiae Fructus and Zingiberis Rhizoma inhibited platelet aggregation, but aqueous extracts of Zizyphi Fructus and Ginseng Radix did not. Two components of Zingiberis Rhizoma, 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol, also inhibited platelet aggregation. These results suggest that Evodiae Fructus and Zingiberis Rhizoma may play important roles in the anti-aggregation effects of goshuyuto and that 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol are among the active ingredients. Therefore, goshuyuto may ameliorate migraine by preventing the hyper-aggregation of platelets in migraine with aura.

6408331|t|Biosynthesis of long-chain polyenoic acids from arachidonic acid in cultures of enriched spermatocytes and spermatids from mouse testis.
6408331|a|Primary spermatocytes (PS), round spermatids (RS) and condensing spermatids (CS) from mouse testes were enriched on Sta-Put 1 X g density gradients and cultured for 22 or 44 hr in the presence of [1-14C]arachidonate. Mass and radioactivity were measured by gas radiochromatography of constituent fatty acids of the various complex lipid classes fractionated by thin layer chromatography. Patterns and levels of incorporation were compared with those of whole testis, both in vitro and in vivo. The 20:4, 22:4, 22:5, 24:4 and 24:5 of the germinal cells contained levels of radioactivity in each lipid class which were consistent with an important role for the germinal cells in long-chain polyenoic acid (LCPA) metabolism. Cells which represented later stages of spermatogenesis (RS, CS) incorporated much higher percentages and absolute amounts of radioactivity into the fatty acids derived from 20:4 by elongation-desaturation pathways than did PS or whole testis in vitro. These differences were most pronounced in triacylglycerol of CS. Distributions of mass and radioactivity among lipid classes suggest synthesis of triacylglycerol by CS with a high degree of specificity for 22 or 24 carbon LCPA at the sn-3 position.

10612195|t|[Normal Doppler ultrasound values of the anterior cerebral artery of premature and newborn infants with reference to cardiac function parameters and intestinal blood flow profile]
10612195|a|BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic impairements play an important role in the development of cerebral lesions. These changes may be detected by dopplersonographic flow measurements in cerebral arteries. For that reason it is necessary to establish normal values in relation to cardiac function and intestinal perfusion. METHODS & PATIENTS: 62 neonates with uncomplicated postnatal adaptation were investigated by dopplersonographic measurements of ant. cerebral artery (ACA) at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th day of life. Relations to left ventricular ejection time (LVET) and systemic blood pressure were described. An index of parameters from ACA and sup. mesenteric artery was determined. RESULTS: We demonstrated a significant increase of flow velocities and a decrease of pulsatility index in relation to increased gestational and postnatal age. There was a positive correlation between LVET and systemic blood pressure to peak flow velocities and a negative correlation to pulsatility index. The index of the parameters from ACA to sup. mesenteric artery was not depended on gestational age. The index of the flow velocities of both arteries increased from first to fifth day of life, whereas the index of the pulsatility index decreased. CONCLUSION: With these results it is possible to evaluate cerebral hemodynamic changes by dopplersonographic measurements in relation to gestational and postnatal age and under consideration of cardiac function and mesenteric perfusion.

7419750|t|Location of motoneurons supplying individual muscles in normal and grafted supernumerary limbs of Xenopus laevis.
7419750|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate innervation of transplanted supernumerary hindlimbs in the frog (Xenopus laevis). Motoneurons innervating identified muscles in normal and supernumerary limbs were located by the method of retrograde transport of HRP after intramuscular injection. In the lumbar spinal cord of normal Xenopus, motoneurons supplying medial hindlimb muscles, which are derived from the ventral muscle mass during development, are located at the medial end of the motor column; those innervating lateral, dorsally-derived muscles, lie at the lateral end of the motor column. In animals with supernumerary limbs, motoneurons supplying the transplant usually occupied the same mediolateral position as those supplying the same muscle in the normal limb. However, the rostrocaudal location of these motor pools exhibited greater flexibility. When the transplant was innervated by a rostral nerve of the lumbar plexus, motoneurons supplying gastrocnemius could be located in a region of the spinal cord whose motoneurons do not normally innervate this muscle. There is thus no rigid requirement that gastrocnemius motoneurons be located at specific segmental levels. Motoneurons supplying gastrocnemius in the normal limb on the experimental side showed normal rostrocaudal distributions, indicating little rearrangement of these motor pools. Dorsal root ganglion cells labeled after HRP injection could be concentrated in a ganglion which normally supplies little or no innervation to the injected muscle. The location of these cells confirmed the segmental source of sensory innervation of the extra limb; i.e., there was no stray innervation. Animals with supernumerary limbs exhibited little or no increase in the number of motoneurons on the extra limb side. In contrast, dorsal root ganglion cell populations exhibited a large increase on the experimental side.

15652350|t|CIR, a corepressor of CBF1, binds to PAP-1 and effects alternative splicing.
15652350|a|We have reported that PAP-1, a product of a causative gene for autosomal retinitis pigmentosa, plays a role in splicing. In this study, CIR, a protein originally identified as a CBF1-interacting protein and reported to act as a transcriptional corepressor, was identified as a PAP-1 binding protein and its function as a splicing factor was investigated. In addition to a basic lysine and acidic serine-rich (BA) domain and a zinc knuckle-like motif, CIR has an arginine/serine dipeptide repeat (RS) domain in its C terminal region. The RS domain has been reported to be present in the superfamily of SR proteins, which are involved in splicing reactions. We generated CIR mutants with deletions of each BA and RS domain and studied their subcellular localizations and interactions with PAP-1 and other SR proteins, including SC35, SF2/ASF, and U2AF35. CIR was found to interact with U2AF35 through the BA domain, with SC35 and SF2/ASF through the RS domain, and with PAP-1 outside the BA domain in vivo and in vitro. CIR was found to be colocalized with SC35 and PAP-1 in nuclear speckles. Then the effect of CIR on splicing was investigated using the E1a minigene as a reporter in HeLa cells. Ectopic expression of CIR with the E1a minigene changed the ratio of spliced isoforms of E1a that were produced by alternative selection of 5'-splice sites. These results indicate that CIR is a member of the family of SR-related proteins and that CIR plays a role in splicing regulation.

2957258|t|Insulin-like growth factor-I augments gonadotropin-stimulated androgen biosynthesis by cultured rat testicular cells.
2957258|a|In addition to the well-known growth stimulating effects of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), recent studies suggest that these peptides may also modulate the differentiated functions of endocrine cells. Thus, in the present studies, we have investigated the actions of IGFs on androgen biosynthesis by cultured testicular cells. Treatment of cells obtained from adult hypophysectomized rats with LH (1 ng/ml) stimulated testosterone production 60-fold over basal levels. In contrast, treatment with either synthetic human IGF-I or IGF-II failed to stimulate androgen production. However, concomitant treatment of the LH-containing cultures with increasing doses of IGF-I (10-500 ng/ml) augmented testosterone production up to 70% over that seen with LH alone (ED50 = 67 ng/ml). Similar effects were obtained with IGF-II but this peptide was about 10-fold less potent than IGF-I. In addition, these peptides also stimulated the accumulation of pregnenolone and progesterone in the culture medium. Additional studies demonstrated specific binding of [125I]iodo-IGF-I to testicular cells. This binding was competed by IGF-related peptides with the potency order IGF-II = IGF-I greater than insulin whereas unrelated peptides did not compete. The cellular localization of these receptors was examined in testicular cells separated on a metrizamide density gradient. IGF-I receptors were evenly distributed between two cell peaks containing subpopulations of Leydig cells whereas much less binding was found in other testicular cell types. Coupled with recent findings indicating testicular production of IGF-I, the present results suggest that this peptide may act as a positive intratesticular modulator of Leydig cell differentiation.

8553336|t|[The vomeronasal organ--a rediscovered sensory organ]
8553336|a|The authors review the function and anatomy of the vomeronasal organ (organ of Jacobson), a chemosensory organ situated in the nose. In mammals, stimulation of the vomeronasal organ induces sexual behaviour and changes the hormonal status of males and females. Impairment of the vomeronasal organ in rats disrupts both the females' ultrasound calling during oestrus and their maternal behaviour. Stimulation of the vomeronasal organ promotes sexual maturation of juvenile females and induces abortion and production of pheromones. Earlier on, the vomeronasal organ in man was believed to be present only at the foetal stage; in 1991 its presence was reestablished in adults. Electrophysiological studies show that the vomeronasal organ of man is stimulated by steroids found in human skin. The physiological properties of the receptor cells of the vomeronasal organ are different from those of the olfactory organ.

6085449|t|Homeless alcoholic women on skid row.
6085449|a|Studies of homeless alcoholic women remain rare. Women on Skid Row in New York City were sought out at the Women's Shelter for a study of homeless women alcoholics. The findings in this study of 31 homeless alcoholic women tend to confirm an earlier study by Garrett and Bahr in most respects. A major difference relates to the population's lack of homogeneity. A life-long pattern of marginality does not exist for most of the women. All judged to be alcoholic, some lived with their families, husbands, or a male partner prior to coming to the shelter. Almost a third lived alone. Sometimes the death of someone close or other crisis precipitated homelessness. In many instances there was no apparent crisis. For a substantial group of these women there did seem to be a long-standing pattern of instability and transient living in the two years preceding their move to the shelter. Public resources invested in shelter care are much needed either for individuals whose limited resources run out or where a crisis results in the loss of safe, adequate shelter.

11276839|t|Surgical treatment of giant cell tumours of the thoracic and lumbar spine: report of nine patients.
11276839|a|Giant cell tumours involving vertebral bodies are still difficult to treat, though results are gradually improving. The object of this study was to assess the results of "complete excision", both of previously untreated giant cell tumours and of recurrences, and to consider the possible effects of any tumour contamination during operation. Nine consecutive patients with giant cell tumours of the thoracic and lumbar spine were treated surgically between 1986 and 1995. Four of these patients were referred with recurrent tumours. All operations aimed at complete resection of the tumour, where possible an en-bloc approach was used. The spines were reconstructed with autografts and instrumentation. All patients were regularly reviewed as part of an on-going study. Following the five operations for previously untreated tumours ("primary" operations), there were no local recurrences, but one patient died of pulmonary metastases. One of the four patients operated upon for a recurrence developed a further recurrence, which was excised 2 1/2 years ago. It would seem that giant cell tumours of the thoracic and lumbar spine, including recurrences, should be treated by complete excision. The en-bloc approach is the safest technique. Where an intralesional component is unavoidable, total removal of the (pseudo)capsule should be ensured by preliminary extralesional dissection. Any tumour spill should be meticulously removed. The use of frozen sections to check resection margins is advisable.

15223461|a|Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by hepatic venous outflow obstruction. Atrial myxomas account for 35% to 50% of primary cardiac tumors and are usually located in the left atrium. We describe a patient who presented with hepatic inferior vena cava and portal vein thrombosis due to a large myxoma of the right atrium. After the successful removal of the tumor, ascites resolved completely. We conclude that right atrial myxoma is a rare but potentially curable cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome.

8715553|t|A self-care assessment tool (SCAT) for persons with a spinal cord injury: an expanded abstract.
8715553|a|The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable and valid tool that assesses the cognitive and functional skills needed for self-care in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). The Self-Care Assessment Tool (SCAT) assesses cognitive and functional skills in eight self-care areas: bathing/grooming, nutritional management, medications, mobility/transfers/safety, skin management, bladder management, bowel management and dressing. The tool was carefully developed and has demonstrated content validity. Using two samples of veterans seen in the SCI clinics of two Southern Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, n = 13 and n = 15, interrater reliabilities computed by Pearson product moment correlations for the cognitive, functional and total scores ranged from .69 to .94. Test-retest reliabilities using Pearson product moment correlations for the cognitive, functional and total scores of two groups (n = 14 and n = 15) ranged from -.06 to .86. Regarding predictive validity, R2 was found to be .61 to .90 for the cognitive, functional and total scores. Although continued reliability and validity studies are needed, the SCAT has potential to measure patient rehabilitation outcomes, to evaluate nursing care approaches and to serve as a quality assurance indicator for nursing care.

7789735|t|Effects of different inotropes with antioxidant properties on acute regional myocardial ischemia in isolated rabbit hearts.
7789735|a|1. The antiischemic properties of the flavonoids acetylvitexin-rhamnoside (AVR) and luteolin-7-glucoside-(LUT), combining phosphodiesterase (PDE)-inhibitory and antioxidant properties, were studied in comparison to amrinone (AMR) or superoxide dismutase (SOD). The effects of the new dihydropyridine-type calcium-agonist Bay T 5006 were studied in comparison to Bay K 8644. 2. In isolated Langendorff-rabbit hearts perfused at constant pressure, acute regional ischemia (MI) was induced by coronary artery occlusion (CAO) and quantitated from epicardial NADH-fluorescence photography. Drugs were applied either before or after CAO (pre-treatment or treatment) to permit distinguishing the influence of functional and direct cytoprotective actions in the poorly collateralized rabbit hearts. 3. SOD did not affect left ventricular pressure (LVP) or coronary flow (CF) and reduced MI only if applied before CAO. LVP and CF were enhanced by LUT or AMR but not by AVR. MI was reduced to a similar extent in hearts treated with either drug. Cardioprotection by LUT was not improved by starting drug application before CAO. 4. Bay K 8644 reduced LVP and particularly CF, whereas Bay T 5006 did not affect functional parameters. MI was enlarged by Bay K 8644 and remained unaffected by treatment or pretreatment with Bay T 5006. 5. AMR, LUT and AVR possess antiischemic properties related to an improvement of myocardial perfusion. Although oxygen free radicals contribute to ischemic tissue injury, as shown by the cardioprotective effectiveness of SOD, antioxidant properties of the flavonoids LUT and AVR do not seem to be relevant for the antiischemic effects. Our findings also give no evidence for antioxidant properties of dihydropyridines relevant for cardioprotection.

19290923|t|Tec kinases regulate T-lymphocyte development and function: new insights into the roles of Itk and Rlk/Txk.
19290923|a|The Tec (tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma) family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases consists of five members: Tec, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), inducible T-cell kinase (Itk), resting lymphocyte kinase (Rlk/Txk), and bone marrow-expressed kinase (Bmx/Etk). Although their functions are probably best understood in antigen receptor signaling, where they participate in the phosphorylation and regulation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma), it is now appreciated that these kinases contribute to signaling from many receptors and that they participate in multiple downstream pathways, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. In T cells, three Tec kinases are expressed, Itk, Rlk/Txk, and Tec. Itk is expressed at highest amounts and plays the major role in regulating signaling from the T-cell receptor. Recent studies provide evidence that these kinases contribute to multiple aspects of T-cell biology and have unique roles in T-cell development that have revealed new insight into the regulation of conventional and innate T-cell development. We review new findings on the Tec kinases with a focus on their roles in T-cell development and mature T-cell differentiation.

8094231|t|CD40 ligand mutations in x-linked immunodeficiency with hyper-IgM.
8094231|a|Signalling for the B-cell immunoglobulin isotype switch requires T-cell-derived cytokines and T-B cell interaction, which operates primarily through the CD40 molecule on B cells with its ligand (CD40L) on activated T cells (reviewed in ref. 1). The CD40L is a type II membrane protein with homology to tumour necrosis factor-alpha and -beta, and has important functions in B-cell activation and differentiation. Human CD40L maps on Xq26.3-27.1 (ref. 3), the region where a primary immunodeficiency characterized by an immunoglobulin isotype switch defect (the hyper-IgM immunodeficiency syndrome, HIGM1) has been localized. The hypothesis that HIGM1 involves an abnormality of the CD40L has been tested. We report here the lack of CD40L expression in four unrelated male children with the hyper-IgM syndrome. CD40L transcripts in these patients showed either deletions or point mutations clustered within a limited region of the CD40L extracellular domain. These genetic alterations with abnormal CD40L expression provide a molecular basis for immunoglobulin isotype switch defects observed in this immunodeficiency.

3232045|t|Aerobic power during maximal exercise in untrained and well-trained persons with quadriplegia and paraplegia.
3232045|a|The aerobic power during maximal exercise was studied in 58 males with traumatic spinal cord lesions from C4 to L4 (25 well-trained "world-class athletes" and 33 untrained). For comparison we tested five well arm-trained and five arm-untrained able-bodied subjects. During maximal wheelchair exercise the aerobic power (VO2 peak), pulmonary ventilation and blood lactate concentration was higher in subjects with lower levels of spinal cord injury. At each injury level above C6-C7, nearly all trained subjects reached higher VO2 peaks than untrained subjects with the corresponding level of lesion. The mean values for trained paraplegic persons were 2.16 +/- 0.38 l x min-1, corresponding to 33.6 +/- 6.7 ml x kg-1 x min-1. The peak heart rate was lower in the quadriplegic than in the paraplegic group with no or only small difference between trained and untrained subjects at the same level of spinal cord injury. Spinal cord lesions with pareses reduce the total active skeletal muscle mass. This can cause physical inactivity, medical complications and social isolation. As a consequence, cardiovascular disorders as cause of death is higher in this group compared to the general population. Therefore, one aim of rehabilitation is to increase the individual's performance in daily life activities. It has been shown that the normal daily life activities of quadri- and paraplegic individuals with no additional physical training are not intense enough to maintain a satisfactory level of physical fitness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

449802|t|Method of delivery and developmental outcome at five years of age.
449802|a|A controlled follow-up study examined the impact of delivery method on developmental outcome of the child. The modes of delivery investigated were low forceps delivery (188 infants), midcavity forceps delivery (51 infants), forceps rotation with forceps delivery (57 infants), manual rotation with forceps delivery (67 infants), elective caesarean section (101 infants) and spontaneous delivery (control, 207 infants). Breech presentation (100 infants) was separately compared with the vertex presentation groups. Sample selection controlled for complications during pregnancy and low birthweight and was restricted to married English-speaking mothers. The children were assessed at the age of five years on verbal and non-verbal subtests of a standardized intelligence scale, tests of gross motor coordination, and auditory and visual tests. A full paediatric examination was also performed. Breech presentation children performed less well on tests of balance and fine motor coordination and on visual acuity and stereopsis testing than children who presented in the vertex position. No deleterious effect of delivery method was found. In the absence of other complicating events (like a poor antenatal history, prematurity, and a disorganized home environment) delivery complication constitutes an early risk factor which the growing child is able to overcome.

15969514|t|Glyphosate-tolerant soybeans remain compositionally equivalent to conventional soybeans (Glycine max L.) during three years of field testing.
15969514|a|Previous studies have shown that the composition of glyphosate-tolerant soybeans (GTS) and selected processed fractions was substantially equivalent to that of conventional soybeans over a wide range of analytes. This study was designed to determine if the composition of GTS remains substantially equivalent to conventional soybeans over the course of several years and when introduced into multiple genetic backgrounds. Soybean seed samples of both GTS and conventional varieties were harvested during 2000, 2001, and 2002 and analyzed for the levels of proximates, lectin, trypsin inhibitor, and isoflavones. The measured analytes are representative of the basic nutritional and biologically active components in soybeans. Results show a similar range of natural variability for the GTS soybeans as well as conventional soybeans. It was concluded that the composition of commercial GTS over the three years of breeding into multiple varieties remains equivalent to that of conventional soybeans.

1491108|t|Additive effects of dopamine and 8-OH-DPAT microinjected into the nucleus ambiguus in eliciting vagal bradycardia in rats.
1491108|a|The effects of combined microinjection into the nucleus ambiguus (NA) of dopamine (DA) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5HT-1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino]tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) on arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR) were studied in 24 urethane-anaesthetized, artificially ventilated spinal (C1) rats. Sites from which bradycardia was elicited by microinjection of L-glutamate (GLU) were selected for microinjection of DA and 8-OH-DPAT into the NA. Microinjections of 8-OH-DPAT (60-300 pmol in 10 nl) elicited a dose-dependent bradycardia; the HR responses elicited by microinjection of 300 pmol of 8-OH-DPAT were significantly larger (-34.0 +/- 3.0) than responses elicited by the threshold dose of 60 pmol (-3.1 +/- 0.1 bpm). The onset latency of the HR responses elicited by the 300 pmol of 8-OH-DPAT was 6.5 +/- 0.5 s and the peak was reached in 40.0 +/- 8.0 s. The duration of these responses was 615 +/- 3.5 s. Microinjection of DA (1 nmol in 10 nl) within 3-5 s from the time of 8-OH-DPAT microinjection (60 pmol in 2 nl) into the NA at sites previously shown to elicit decreases in HR following microinjection of GLU, produced significant additive effects in eliciting bradycardia (20.4 +/- 2.9 bpm) when compared with decreases in HR elicited by microinjection of DA (11.1 +/- 1.8 bpm) or of 8-OH-DPAT (3.1 +/- 0.1 bpm) alone. There were no changes in AP after microinjections of DA, 8-OH-DPAT or of these two substances combined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

12145843|t|[Hepatitis B vaccination. Advocating for a protection principle]
12145843|a|Hepatitis B is a worldwide disease. More than 350 million persons are chronic carriers and around one-quarter of these chronic carriers will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer within 30 years. Since 1981, more than a billion doses of hepatitis B vaccine have been used worldwide and it is considered one of the safest vaccines ever produced. The suggestion of a link between hepatitis B vaccine and demyelinating diseases has arisen because of case reports, although inevitably some people will develop symptoms of demyelination by chance after receiving hepatitis B vaccine. Scientific data could never demonstrate a causal association between hepatitis B vaccine and central nervous system diseases, including MS. However, the hypothesis of a potential causal relationship between vaccination and multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases was brought to public debate by the French Health Authority after the publication of these cases. Since 1998, in France, several court decisions held pharmaceutical companies responsible for the development of multiple sclerosis in patients who were given hepatitis B vaccine on two grounds: the chronological coincidence between vaccination and the development of the plaintiffs' MS, and the fact that a causal link between the two cannot be excluded, although the Appeals Court did declare that "it is indisputable that there is no definite scientific evidence of a relation between vaccination and the onset of the disease". On 1st October 1998, the French Minister of Health decided to stop hepatitis B vaccination in schools. Stopping immunization on the basis of unfounded worries has led to decreased vaccine coverage levels among children. Two recent studies published in the N Engl J Med in February 2001 confirm the lack of evidence of an association between hepatitis B vaccination and multiple sclerosis. The Academie nationale de Medecine should be consulted about this major public health issue.

9512182|a|The relative antioxidant effect of ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefuroxime on oxygen-reactive species was examined in vitro using stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils. There was no evidence that any of the beta-lactam agents tested had an effect on superoxide or H2O2 generation. In contrast, all of the beta-lactam agents prevented hypochlorous acid (HOCI) chlorination of 1,1-dimethyl-4-chloro-3,5-cyclo-hexanedione in a cell-free system at concentrations of < 10 microg/ml. Furthermore, all antibiotics provided dose-dependent protection against HOCI cytotoxicity to 16HBE140 bronchial epithelial cells. Taken together, these data indicate a possible therapeutic role for beta-lactam agents in protecting host tissues from HOCI-induced oxidative damage.

7588923|t|The reactivity of the contralateral artery at the time of balloon dilation during coronary angioplasty.
7588923|a|The response of the contralateral arteries was investigated during balloon angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery. Thirty patients were studied. Coronary arteriograms were obtained at baseline, during maximal balloon inflation and at the end of the procedure. Luminal diameter was measured by a quantitative coronary arteriography analysis system. During balloon inflation the luminal diameter of the proximal segment of the right coronary artery increased by 2.4 +/- 6% (P < 0.05), and that of the left circumflex artery increased by 0.6 +/- 6% (P = ns). Both returned to near baseline values after angioplasty. In patients with increased collaterals during balloon inflation the left circumflex proximal segment increased more significantly than in patients with unchanged collaterals. The luminal diameter of the distal segment of the right coronary artery increased by 9 +/- 8% (P < 0.001) and that of the left circumflex artery by 8 +/- 11% (P < 0.01) during balloon inflation, returning to near baseline values after angioplasty. Thus, vasodilation of the contralateral arteries during balloon inflation at the time of coronary angioplasty occurs mainly in the distal segments, and appears to be related to an increase in collateral filling.

3658246|t|Parental attitudes toward adolescent sexuality: transcultural perspectives.
3658246|a|The problem of teenage pregnancy continues to impact private and public resources, affecting all socioeconomic and cultural groups. A key factor for nurse practitioners to consider when planning sex education programs is the differing parental attitudes toward teenage sexuality. These attitudes are especially important to keep in mind when dealing with parents from minority cultural groups, as these groups are often highly influential in determining the nature of adolescent sexual behavior and attitudes toward reproduction. A study of Cuban and Haitian child-rearing practices clearly demonstrates two divergent parental views of adolescent sexuality. Nurse practitioners must recognize these differing views, and individualize their approach, in order to develop culturally sensitive sex education programs for adolescents and their parents. Suggestions are provided for development of such programs for Cuban and Haitian parents and children.

8273637|t|Antispasmodic drugs to reduce discomfort and colonic spasm during barium enemas: comparison of oral hyoscyamine, i.v. glucagon, and no drug.
8273637|a|OBJECTIVE. Parenterally administered glucagon is currently the agent of choice for reducing abdominal discomfort and colonic spasm during a barium enema. Because glucagon is expensive and frequently causes nausea, we evaluated the use of oral hyoscyamine sulfate as an alternate agent and compared it with IV glucagon and no medication. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. A total of 349 adult patients undergoing barium enema examinations were randomly assigned in a prospective fashion to one of four groups: (1) no medication (87 patients); (2) 1 mg of IV glucagon (88 patients); (3) 0.125 mg of oral hyoscyamine sulfate (87 patients); and (4) 0.25 mg of oral hyoscyamine sulfate (87 patients). The degree of distension of the colon on radiographs obtained after fluoroscopy, the amount of abdominal distress after the procedure, and the number of side effects (nausea, palpitations, blurred vision, dry mouth) were analyzed. To evaluate the amount of abdominal discomfort more completely, we asked the last 248 patients to estimate the level of severity of the discomfort (none, mild, moderate, or severe). RESULTS. We found no difference in the degree of distension of the colon in the four groups (p = .63). Most patients (79%) had some degree of abdominal discomfort. Fewer patients in the group who received no medication (10%) had no or mild pain compared with those given glucagon (15%, p < .05), 0.125 mg of hyoscyamine (14%, p < .05), or 0.25 mg of hyoscyamine (12%, p = .15). Less nausea occurred in the group that received 0.125 mg of hyoscyamine than in the other groups (p < .03). No patients in any of the groups had allergic or severe side effects. CONCLUSION. When compared with IV glucagon, oral hyoscyamine had fewer side effects, but the degree of colonic distension or abdominal distress was not significantly different. In addition, hyoscyamine is considerably less expensive than glucagon and can be given orally. Patients who received medications had less discomfort than those who did not. However, the degree of distension was not different.

17961685|t|Value of the bronchodilator response in assessing controller naive asthmatic children.
17961685|a|OBJECTIVE: To define the bronchodilator response (BDR) cutoff point that best identified asthma to determine the frequency of abnormal spirometry results across severity. STUDY DESIGN: Controller naive children were evaluated with clinical criteria alone to establish a diagnosis of asthma and severity classification, then compared with the BDR, which was calculated as the percent change from the initial forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Receiver operator characteristic analysis determined the cutoff point for asthma diagnosis that gave the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Children with asthma (n = 346) and 51 children without asthma, aged 4 to 17 years, who met entry criteria for spirometry were identified. The mean BDR in asthmatics was 8.6% (95% CI, 7.5-9.8), compared with 2.2% (95% CI, 0.2-4.3) for non-asthmatics (P < .001). A BDR > or = 9% best differentiated these populations with a sensitivity rate of 42.5% and a specificity rate of 86.3%. Abnormal spirometry results, defined as a BDR > or = 9%, a forced expiratory volume in 1 second < 80% predicted, or both, ranged from 44.4% for mild intermittent bronchial asthma to 57.0% for severe persistent bronchial asthma. CONCLUSION: Spirometric criteria that include BDR can potentially identify children who have clinically mild asthma and might benefit from controller therapy.

2826986|t|[Siblings of familial adenomatosis coli with gastric cancer--case report]
2826986|a|Adenomatosis coli is recently regarded as a systemic disease with a predisposition to multiple tumor formation. We report siblings of familial adenomatosis coli with gastric cancers. Case 1 was a 58 year-old elder brother. His diagnosis was familial adenomatosis coli accompanied with colon cancer and simultaneous early gastric cancer. Total colectomy and partial gastrectomy were carried out on Mar. 13, 1984 at our hospital. Numerous polyps over the whole colon and an ulcerative tumor in the hepatic flexure were found in the resected colon. Histologically tubular adenocarcinoma were demonstrated in the ulcerative tumor, and all other polyps were adenomas. In the resected gastric specimen, there were two shallow, depressed lesions on the each anterior and posterior wall of the antrum. Histologically both of them were adenocarcinoma confined within the mucosa. Postoperative course was satisfactory and he is quite healthy 2 and a half years after surgery. Case 2 was a 56 year-old younger brother. He received a partial gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer at another hospital on May 20, 1982. In one and a half year from the surgery, a large lung tumor (probably metastasis of the gastric cancer) was found and he received chemotherapy. He also received radiation therapy in June, 1984 and during this admission barium enema study was performed. It revealed numerous polyps over the whole colon. No cancerous lesions were found. He died of lung tumor on Dec. 8, 1985. The similar siblings were first reported by Kokaji et al. in 1984, and our cases seem to be the second ones.

15587241|t|Cytochrome P450-mediated activation and toxicity of chlorpyrifos in male and female rats.
15587241|a|This study compared CYP-mediated activation and toxicity of chlorpyrifos (CPF) in male and female rats, since gender difference in CPF toxicity in rats has been reported. A dose of 50 mg/kg of CPF in corn oil was administered ip to 2 groups of male and female rats while the respective control groups received the vehicle alone. Measurement of cholinesterase activity in brain showed no difference in cholinesterase inhibition between male and female rats 3 h following CPF administration. In contrast, inhibition of plasma cholinesterase was significantly greater in females than males. The activities of microsomal CYP 1A1, 2B1, 2E1 and 3AV 2 determined whether CPF, a suicide substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes, was metabolized by the liver CYP enzymes. The CYP 1A1 and 2B1 activities were significantly decreased in both male and female rats, with the CYP 1A1 decrease in females markedly greater than that in males. CPF produced a significant inhibition of only CYP 3A1/2 activity, but not CYP 2E1 activity, irrespective of gender effect. These results demonstrated that CYP 1A1, 2B1 and 3A1/2 were differentially involved in the metabolism of CPF to CPF-oxon in both genders and the extent of plasma cholinesterase inhibition was significantly greater in female than male rats.

8355016|t|Positive identification in a case of intentional extreme fragmentation.
8355016|a|The investigation of the first of the murders of young males to which Jeffrey Dahmer confessed led to systematic survey of two acres of semirural property in Bath Township, Ohio. The survey revealed the fragmentary skeleton of a young adult male, as well as bones of several species of animals. Through archaeobiological analysis, the animal bones were identified and taphonomic modifications documented. The human bones were dry and weathered, and many were rodent-gnawed, indicating that they had been exposed for many years. The human bones displayed an extreme degree of splintering, warping, bending, and spiral breakage. The only relatively complete bone was a cervical vertebra. Dismemberment and breakage had been accomplished by cutting, blunt force, and, in the case of the ribs, manual bending. Even in so extreme a case of intentional fragmentation, however, forensic anthropological analysis resulted in positive identification, with the primary criteria based on matching osteological features evident in premortem and postmortem radiographs of a cervical vertebra.

2785272|t|The high count rate performance of a two-dimensionally position-sensitive detector for positron emission tomography.
2785272|a|In positron tomographs using a small number of position-sensitive detectors, each detector must operate at high singles event rates, especially during dynamic studies. To enable the PENN-PET tomography to perform studies involving high data rates, the high count rate behaviour of the position-sensitive scintillation detector used in the tomograph was investigated at singles rates in excess of 2 million counts per second (MCPS). Detector dead-time, minimised through the use of pulse clipping (clipping time, 120 ns), is a maximum of 20% at the highest data rates. At 2 MCPS and 240 ns pulse integration time, the full width at half maximum of the point spread function (PSF) worsens by approximately 20% over its low count rate value of 5.2 mm. Furthermore, at high count rates, pulse pile-up produces long tails in the PSF along the detector's long axis. These tails were reduced or eliminated through the use of a shortened pulse integration time (160 ns instead of 240 ns), an upper level energy discriminator and a local centroid event positioning algorithm. Detector performance was characterised for different combinations of these event processing techniques, and the mechanisms by which pulse pile-up distorts the high count rate PSF were investigated using computer simulations. With the incorporation of the high count rate event processing techniques, the detector's count rate capability enables the PENN-PET tomograph to handle most current imaging protocols.

15527724|t|Consider colonoscopy for young patients with hematochezia.
15527724|a|BACKGROUND: Hematochezia is a common complaint in adult patients aged <50 years. Most studies of lower endoscopy for rectal bleeding have concentrated on older patients or have failed to mention the location of lesions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the findings of complete colonoscopy in adults younger than 50 years with rectal bleeding. METHODS: Data were retrieved from medical records and included demographics, indications, endoscopic findings, and histology. Lesions were labeled according to location: proximal to the splenic flexure or distal to (and including) the splenic flexure. Excluded were those with a history of colitis, colorectal cancer, polyps, anemia, significant weight loss, severe bleeding, or strong family history of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: The study included 223 patients with rectal bleeding aged <50 years who had undergone a colonoscopy. Normal findings were recorded for 48 (21.5%). Four (1.8%) were diagnosed with cancer in the distal colon, and 22 (9.9%) were found to have colon adenomas, 6 of whom had proximal adenomas only. Hemorrhoids were present in 135 patients (60.5%). Other findings included colitis, angiodysplasia, diverticulosis, anal fissures, and rectal ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: Colon neoplasms may be present even in younger adults with nonurgent rectal bleeding. Though most findings were benign and located in the distal colon, colonoscopy should be strongly considered for this patient group.

16250016|t|Expression of the mechanosensitive 2PK+ channel TREK-1 in human osteoblasts.
16250016|a|TREK-1 is a mechanosensitive member of the two-pore domain potassium channel family (2PK+) that is also sensitive to lipids, free fatty acids (including arachidonic acid), temperature, intracellular pH, and a range of clinically relevant compounds including volatile anaesthetics. TREK-1 is known to be expressed at high levels in excitable tissues, such as the nervous system, the heart and smooth muscle, where it is believed to play a prominent role in controlling resting cell membrane potential and electrical excitability. In this report, we use RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to confirm that human derived osteoblasts and MG63 cells express TREK-1 mRNA and protein. In addition, we show gene expression of TREK2c and TRAAK channels. Furthermore, whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology demonstrates that these cells express a spontaneously active, outwardly rectifying potassium "background leak" current that shares many similarities to TREK-1. The outward current is largely insensitive to TEA and Ba2+, and is sensitive to application of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). In addition, blocking TREK-1 channel activity is shown to upregulate bone cell proliferation. It is concluded that human osteoblasts functionally express TREK-1 and that these channels contribute, at least in part, to the resting membrane potential of human osteoblast cells. We hypothesise a possible role for TREK-1 in mechanotransduction, leading to bone remodelling.

7932717|t|Gene activation by the Escherichia coli positive regulator, OmpR. Phosphorylation-independent mechanism of activation by an OmpR mutant.
7932717|a|In Escherichia coli, expression of the major outer membrane proteins, OmpC and OmpF, is regulated through the functions of OmpR and EnvZ at the transcriptional level in response to the medium osmolarity. OmpR is the crucial activator that helps RNA polymerase to efficiently trigger ompC and ompF transcription. This OmpR function is modulated by phosphorylation mediated by the cognate sensory kinase, EnvZ. Phosphorylation at the N-terminal domain of OmpR results in substantial enhancement of the DNA-binding ability of the C-terminal domain, thereby allowing the activation of ompC and ompF transcription by OmpR. Here we isolated an OmpR mutant which lacks the N-terminal half, but can enhance transcription in vivo. This novel type of OmpR mutant was revealed to have a single amino acid replacement of Gly227 to Cys. The newly-introduced-Cys residue allows OmpR molecules to form a stable dimer in vitro without the help of the N-terminal half. This altered C-terminal half is able to bind efficiently and specifically to the cognate DNA in vitro. It can function as an activator for ompC transcription in vitro in a phosphorylation-independent manner. These results suggest that the putative activator domain of OmpR, together with the DNA-binding domain, is most likely located in the C-terminal half. They also suggested that the phosphorylation of OmpR may not be essential for gene activation per se.

636831|a|The succession of amplitudes constituting spontaneous electroencephalographic activity cannot be regarded as a strictly normal distribution. Spontaneous activity and the evoked response are not independent. The signal (evoked response)is, in some cases, non-stationary. The average visual-evoked response comprises several successive temporal fragments of which the stationary character varies. This variability of the average visual-evoked response argues in favour of the complexity of its genesis.

3492737|t|[Study of cerebral metabolism and blood flow in partial complex epilepsy and status epilepticus in man using positron emission tomography]
3492737|a|Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with the oxygen-15 steady state inhalation technique was used to provide quantitative values of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and oxygen extraction ratio (OER) in 25 patients with partial complex seizures during the interictal state, in 1 patient with recurrent temporal seizures and in 3 patients whose EEGs were characterized by periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). Interictal scans showed temporal zone(s) of hypoperfusion and hypometabolism in 80% of patients with normal X-ray CT Scan. In all cases, ictal scans revealed a focal or multifocal increase in CBF and CMRO2. The localization of the most affected regions correlated well with the spatial distribution of the EEG abnormalities. Comparison of the different values of CBF, CMRO2 and OER showed that the increase in perfusion always exceeded that of oxygen consumption and hence was accompanied by a significant decrease in OER, the latter was always the most prominent in the region of the focus determined by serial EEG recordings. The observed imbalance between blood flow and oxidative glucose metabolism could suggest an impairment of O2 utilization by the mitochondria in the epilepticus focus during seizures or status epilepticus.

6759581|t|Immunoradiometric assay of lipid A: a test for detecting and quantitating endotoxins of various origins.
6759581|a|The ability to measure circulating endotoxin in various disease states has been hampered by the lack of a specific and quantitative assay. The test most commonly used has been the Limulus gelation assay, which measures an enzymatic effect of endotoxin rather than the substance itself. Based on a solid-phase immunoradiometric assay previously developed to detect the specific lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 026, a similar assay has been developed for the lipid A moiety of endotoxins. The assay uses rabbit antibodies to lipid A which do not react with ketodeoxyoctonate, myristic or beta-hydroxymyristic acids, and detects lipid A obtained from endotoxins of various origins after acid hydrolysis of lipopolysaccharide. Experiments in rats given exogenous endotoxin suggest that this assay can be useful for quantitation of bacterial endotoxins in serum and for studying the pathophysiology of experimental endotoxemia.

8669086|t|Infusible platelet membrane microvesicles: a potential transfusion substitute for platelets.
8669086|a|BACKGROUND: Several substitutes for intact, viable platelets have been used for transfusion, both to people and in animal models, with varied success. Infusible platelet membrane (IPM) is prepared from human platelets. IPM retains the glycoprotein (GP)lb receptor and has platelet factor 3 activity (procoagulant activity). However, factor V, serotonin, a cytoplasmic marker enzyme (purine nucleotide phosphorylase), GPIIb/IIIa complex, and HLA class I and II antigens are all absent in IPM. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: IPM is prepared from outdated platelets. The platelets were disrupted by freezing and thawing; they were washed and heated to inactivate possible viral contaminants, and then the sonicated membrane microvesicle fraction was separated and lyophilized. The hemostatic activity of IPM was measured by its ability to reduce the prolonged bleeding time in thrombocytopenic rabbits. RESULTS: Administration of IPM at a dose of 2 mg per kg results in a substantial reduction in the bleeding time. In a series of 23 experiments, a median preinjection bleeding time of 15 minutes was reduced to 6 minutes within 4 hours after IPM administration. Administration of IPM did show a mild enhancement in the thrombogenicity index, as measured in the Wessler rabbit model. This enhancement is, however, not significant, as a thrombogenicity index value of up to 0.6 is clinically acceptable. CONCLUSION: IPM may have clinical potential as a substitute for platelets in the treatment of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.

16237561|t|Maximum intensity projection of cranial computed tomography data for dental identification.
16237561|a|Dental radiographs play the major role in the identification of victims in mass casualties besides DNA. Under circumstances such as those caused by the recent tsunami in Asia, it is nearly impossible to document the entire dentition using conventional x-rays as it would be too time consuming. Multislice computed tomography can be used to scan the dentition of a deceased within minutes, and the postprocessing software allows visualization of the data adapted to every possible antemortem x-ray for identification. We introduce the maximum intensity projection of cranial computed tomography data for the purpose of dental identification exemplarily in a case of a burned corpse. As transportable CT scanners already exist, these could be used to support the disaster victim identification teams in the field.

15382606|t|Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.
15382606|a|Rheumatic heart disease poses a major challenge to public health and is the most prevalent heart disease in children. The major determinants of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, poor housing, and a shortage of health-care resources. Although cost-effective strategies for the prevention and control of these diseases are available, they remain underutilized in most developing countries. A World Health Organization Expert Consultation reviewed the current scientific knowledge of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, as well as medical and public-health practices, and revised the Jones diagnostic criteria for rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. This revision facilitates the diagnosis of: primary episodes of rheumatic fever, recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever in patients with or without rheumatic heart disease, rheumatic chorea, insidious onset rheumatic carditis and chronic rheumatic heart disease. The present report provides practical recommendations for an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. It also provides practical guidance for implementing cost-effective programmes for controlling these diseases. The report will be of interest to clinicians, policy-makers and public-health professionals.

1452903|a|Effect of water-soluble (polypeptides) fraction (PF) of Crithidia oncopelti on the chemiluminescence of human blood cells and murine splenocytes was studied. The study has shown that PF possessed a capacity to inhibit oxygen-dependent killer system of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in dose-dependent manner. This effect was of a complex nature. The inhibitory effect of PF was demonstrated also in respect to murine mononuclear phagocytes and splenocytes. It was suggested that, in this case, the suppressor effect was related with the influence on membranous cytokines.

2846299|t|Treatment of systemic fungal infections: recent progress and current problems.
2846299|a|Systemic mycoses continue to emerge as life-threatening infections. Considerable progress in treating these infections is being achieved through better application of established available antifungal agents (amphotericin B, flucytosine, miconazole and ketoconazole), and through development of promising investigational agents (fluconazole, itraconazole). Systemic fungal infections, however, continue to present major problems, including clinical resistance, microbiological resistance, emergence of new pathogens, and involvement of more immunocompromised patients. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to review the recent progress and current problems in treatment of systemic fungal infections.

9829359|t|Quantitative analysis of stool losses in adult celiac disease: use of near-infrared analysis reconsidered.
9829359|a|BACKGROUND: An attempt has been made to establish whether near-infrared stool analysis is more suitable for quantifying malabsorption than the traditional stool fat analysis. A group of celiac disease (CD) patients was used as index population. METHODS: Stool fat, nitrogen, and water were measured with near-infrared analysis of 1- and 3-day stool collections in 96 celiac disease patients on a free diet (in 39 also on gluten-free diet) and in 96 matched controls and 14 patients with latent CD. RESULTS: The fecal output of fat, nitrogen, and water was significantly increased in free-diet CD, whereas their percentage content was only slightly modified compared with controls. None of the variables under consideration differed significantly between the 24-h and 72-h stool specimens. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the high value of fecal fat, nitrogen, and water, in celiac disease, are mainly due to the fecal weight, whereas the percentage composition of stool does not offer additional diagnostic information. Furthermore, 3-day stool collection is not necessary to confirm or rule out malabsorption in most patients. Near infrared analysis of 24-h specimens is time- and cost-effective and may increase the use of stool analysis and be usefully employed to monitor the clinical follow-up of patients with chronic diarrhea.

17411272|a|We recently proposed a novel approach to categorize information carried by symbolic sequences based on their usage of repetitive patterns. A simple quantitative index to measure the dissimilarity between two symbolic sequences can be defined. This information dissimilarity index, defined by our formula, is closely related to the Shannon entropy and rank order of the repetitive patterns in the symbolic sequences. Here we discuss the underlying statistical physics assumptions of this dissimilarity index. We use human cardiac interbeat interval time series and DNA sequences as examples to illustrate the applicability of this generic approach to real-world problems.

3618728|t|Directed targeting of immunoerythrocytes provides local protection of endothelial cells from damage by hydrogen peroxide.
3618728|a|Red blood cells bearing anti-mouse IgG antibody on their surface (immunoerythrocytes) may provide for local protection of endothelial cells from the action of hydrogen peroxide. Subconfluent cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells responded sharply to increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Permeabilization of cellular membrane occurred at doses of hydrogen peroxide of from 1 to 3 mM, and was assured by incorporation of trypan blue stain immediately after treatment. Latent damage of cells produced by much lower doses of hydrogen peroxide (0.2-0.4 mM) could be observed after 24-hour incubation of treated cells in the normal culture medium with no hydrogen peroxide. The apparently dead cells differed from intact cells in morphology, were poorly attached to the substrate, and were readily incorporated by trypan blue, thus permitting easy visualization. Immunoerythrocytes bound to the antigen-coated surface enzymatically decreased the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in their microenvironment at least fivefold with respect to the total hydrogen peroxide concentration. Erythrocytes deposited on a part of the endothelial monolayer locally protected it from the damage at hydrogen peroxide concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 mM. Localization of protected zones corresponded precisely to the geometry of the erythrocyte coating. Immunoerythrocytes targeted to the endothelial cells by means of mouse anti-endothelial antiserum did not impair their viability and protected the endothelium from being killed at 0.3-1.2 mM hydrogen peroxide. This approach might be useful for a cell selection in mixed cell populations. The problem of local protection of cells involved in the inflammation focus are discussed.

11021962|t|Preoperative endocrine therapy for breast cancer.
11021962|a|The preoperative use of systemic therapy for primary breast cancer has the potential to downstage tumours. This would render suitable for breast conservation some tumours that were unsuitable at initial presentation, or would convert some inoperable locally advanced breast cancers into tumours that are operable. No survival benefit has been demonstrated for neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with the same therapy given in an adjuvant setting. Preoperative endocrine therapy, in contrast to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, has fewer side effects and has the potential additional advantage that it can be continued throughout the perioperative period. Current data have shown that, in patients with an oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumour, a response approaching 70% could be reached in approximately 3 months using traditional endocrine manipulation such as tamoxifen. Randomised clinical trials are warranted to demonstrate the superiority of preoperative endocrine therapy over conventional adjuvant endocrine therapy, to define the optimum duration of therapy, and to identify the best endocrine agents. Both clinical and laboratory studies are also required to identify factors (in addition to ER) that would precisely predict the response and hence to select appropriate patients and to improve existing methods of monitoring response.

The subjects were treated with timolol as the sole drug for one year and the hemodynamic study was repeated. BP was reduced approximately 18% at rest and 14% during exercise, HR approximately 26% and the cardiac index 28% at rest supine and 32% at rest sitting. During exercise the reductions in Q were 25-30%. The calculated total peripheral resistance was significantly increased at rest as well as during exercise. The product of mean arterial pressure and HR was reduced about 40%. No severe side-effects were seen.

15053252|t|Bone microarchitecture as an important determinant of bone strength.
15053252|a|Structure and microarchitecture are determinant aspects of bone strength and essential elements for the assessment of bone mechanical properties. The main structural determinants of bone mechanical strength include width and porosity in the cortical bone; shape, width, connectivity, and anisotropy in the trabecular bone. There are several methods to assess bone architecture, particularly at the trabecular level. Two different approaches can be identified. The first is based on the use of optical microscopy and on the principles of quantitative histology, which evaluate microarchitecture two-dimensionally. The second applies the most modern diagnostic techniques, employing computed tomography and magnetic resonance to obtain and analyze three-dimensional images. From a clinical point of view, microarchitecture is an interesting aspect to study and define specific patterns, such as glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, or to evaluate bone alterations in transplanted patients. Microarchitecture seems to be a determinant of bone fragility independent of bone density. Moreover, bone microarchitecture seems to be important to understand the mechanisms of bone fragility as well as the action of the drugs used to prevent osteoporotic fractures. Several in vivo studies (on animals and humans) showed important findings on the effects of different treatments on microarchitecture. Bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone seemed to preserve or even improve microarchitecture. These observations can provide an additional interpretation for the anti-fracture effect of drugs from a structural viewpoint. The challenge for the future will be to evaluate bone quality in vivo with the same or better resolution and accuracy than the invasive methods in use today.

12016631|t|Concomitant beta-blocker therapy is associated with a lower occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with decompensated heart failure.
12016631|a|BACKGROUND: Ventricular arrhythmias are nearly universally present in patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) and represent an important cause of mortality in these patients. One of the putative mechanisms for the salutary effects of beta-blockers on sudden death mortality in heart failure is their ability to suppress ventricular arrhythmias. However, supporting data in patients with CHF are sparse, especially in the setting of excessive neurohumoral activation associated with symptomatic decompensated heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 236 patients (159 men; mean age, 61 +/- 14 years) admitted for decompensated CHF. Fifty patients were receiving beta-blockers at the time of the study. The severity of ventricular arrhythmia was assessed by 24-hour Holter recordings by using several prospectively defined measures of ventricular ectopy. All measures of ventricular ectopy were lower in patients receiving beta-blockers. The average hourly total premature ventricular beats (PVCs), hourly ventricular couplets, repetitive PVCs, and frequency of ventricular tachycardia episodes were 15% (P =.02), 75% (P <.05), 72% (P <.05), and 87% (P =.01) lower in patient receiving beta-blockers, respectively. In a multivariate regression analysis, the negative relationship between beta-blockers and the average hourly PVCs (P =.03), the frequency of ventricular pairs (P =.03), repetitive PVCs (P <.05), and ventricular tachycardia episodes (P =.01) remained significant and independent. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant beta-blocker therapy during heart failure decompensation is associated with a marked reduction in complex ventricular ectopy and episodes of ventricular tachycardia. This effect of beta-blockers may play an important protective role by preventing serious ventricular arrhythmias during transient increases in sympathetic activity.

202958|t|Stimulation of sugar uptake and thymidine incorporation in mouse 3T3 cells by calcium phosphate and other extracellular particles.
202958|a|Evidence is presented that the marked stimulation of sugar uptake and thymidine incorporation by addition of extra Ca2+ to stationary phase mouse 3T3 cells in culture is phosphate dependent and due to the action of the calcium phosphate precipitate formed in the medium. The cells are similarly stimulated by a variety of particulate materials, including calcium pyrophosphate, barium sulfate, kaolin, and polystrene beads. The precipitate effects on sugar uptake are of the same magnitude as those seen with certain hormones (insulin, epidermal growth factor) or with fresh 10% calf serum. The effect of barium sulfate on thymidine incorporation is also of the same magnitude as seen with these hormones, but much less than half that found with fresh calf serum. The stimulation by barium sulfate or hormones of thymidine incorporation is not phosphate dependent.

16436541|t|Antibiotic prescribing for acute and recurrent cystitis in primary care: a 4 year descriptive study.
16436541|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore the antibiotic prescribing pattern for cystitis and the patient-related variables associated with prescription during a 4 year period among Italian general practitioners (GPs). METHODS: We obtained information from the 'Health Search Database' (HSD), an Italian general practice research database. From a total sample of 457 672 eligible patients aged >16 years registered up to December 2002, we included those whose diagnoses could be classified as acute (uncomplicated and complicated) and recurrent cystitis. Patients' features and prevalence of antibiotic users were assessed. RESULTS: Of 35 129 cases diagnosed during the period 1999-2002, 96.0% of them were acute cystitis (39.2% recorded as uncomplicated). The prevalence of cases with acute complicated and uncomplicated cystitis slightly increased during the 4 year period, whereas it remained stable for recurrent cystitis. Most of the cystitis cases reported no diagnostic tests. More than 70% of patients were prescribed with at least one antibiotic, with a 4-fold increased risk of antibiotic use for acute cystitis throughout the study period. The prevalence of antibiotic users reached 86.2% for both acute uncomplicated and complicated cystitis in 2002, and 81.5% for recurrent cystitis. Fluoroquinolones represented the most common antibiotics being prescribed although they markedly decreased during these years. Fosfomycin trometamol use increased dramatically, becoming the first choice for any type of cystitis. CONCLUSIONS: Data indicate an evident rise in antibiotic use mostly related to fosfomycin trometamol. They also indicate that such a prescriptive trend finds confirmation from the available evidence for acute uncomplicated cystitis, although the management of recurrent cystitis could be further improved.

15771275|t|Diffusivity and solubility of nitric oxide in water and saline.
15771275|a|Aqueous diffusivities and solubilities of NO were determined by using a chemiluminescence detector to measure time-dependent fluxes across stagnant liquid films confined between polydimethylsiloxane membranes. The NO diffusivities in pure water and PBS at 25 degrees C were found to be (2.21+/-0.02) x 10(-5) cm2 s(-1) and (2.21+/-0.04) x 10(-5) cm2 s(-1), respectively. Although lower than most previous values for NO at room temperature, these diffusivities are very similar to those for O2, as one would expect. Extrapolation to 37 degrees C yielded a value of 3.0 x 10(-5) cm2 s(-1). The solubility of NO in water at 25 degrees C was (1.94+/-0.03) x 10(-6) mol cm(-3) atm(-1), in agreement with the literature. This agreement, along with the excellent fits obtained to the transient flux data (<4% rms error in each experiment), supports the validity of the simultaneously measured diffusivity. The solubility of NO in PBS at 25 degrees C was (1.75+/-0.02) x 10(-6) mol cm(-3) atm(-1). The modest (10%) reduction in solubility relative to that in pure water is consistent with the usual effects of salts on gas solubilities.

15631880|t|Alterations of lipid profile in endurance over-trained subjects.
15631880|a|BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that endurance over-training could alter the favorable effects of well-tolerated training on lipid profile. METHODS: At weeks 1, 6, 15, 26, 36, and 47 of the training program, blood was drawn to test lipid profile of 20 endurance-trained rowers. Diet and caloric intake were controlled. RESULTS: Over-training was diagnosed in five subjects (loss of performance, asthenia, sleep disturbance...) at week 15 and lipid profile of well-trained and over-trained subjects were compared. Training improved cholesterolemic profile and lowered insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: -39 +/- 9%; p=0.02), and triglycerides concentration (-30 +/- 6%; p=0.05) in rowers who did not change to demonstrate over-training. Plasma LPL (+29 +/- 11%; p=0.01) and hepatic lipase (+5 +/- 3%; p=0.01) activities increased in this group suggesting higher TG utilization and turnover. After week 15 and regarding the well-trained condition for the five over-trained subjects, VLDL-TG (-13 +/- 7 %; p=0.03) and Apo-C(3) (-31 +/- 13%; p=0.01) concentrations decreased, while insulin resistance (+17 +/- 7%; p=0.03) and glycerol concentration (+17 +/- 3%; p=0.01) increased and hepatic lipase activity decreased (-14 +/- 4%; p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Over-training was accompanied by alterations in the lipid profile, which appeared to be the consequence of over-training.

6319205|t|[Effect of adrenocorticotropin on progesterone, 20alpha-OH- progesterone and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in isolated luteal cells from rat ovaries]
6319205|a|The present investigation was designed to study the effect of synthetic ACTH on the synthesis of progesterone, 20 alpha-OH-progesterone and adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in isolated luteal cells. Experiments were conducted on rats from three groups. Group I: PMS primed immature rats. Group II: PMS plus hCG primed immature rats. Group III: pregnant rats. Luteal cells were isolated by the Kumai Method (7) using a sucrose density gradient after digestion with trypsin and collagenase. Luteal cells were divided into three fractions; S-1, S-2 and S-3. Following an 18 hr-incubation of S-1 cells of day 7 after PMS injection, a significant increase in progesterone release by ACTH lasted from 6 to 18 hr, whereas 20 alpha-OH-progesterone decreased significantly by ACTH from 8 to 18 hr. There were no differences in progesterone and 20 alpha-OH-progesterone releases from S-2 cells of day 7 between media with and without ACTH. Progesterone release without ACTH reached the peak on day 7 in Group I and on day 6 in Group II. ACTH stimulated progesterone and inhibited 20 alpha-OH-progesterone releases in Groups I and II. The maximum effect of ACTH in both Groups was noted on days 6 and 7. There were no differences in the Effective Dose (ED50) and the Inhibitory Dose (ID50) of ACTH between Group I and Group II. In Group III, releases of progesterone and 20 alpha-OH-progesterone from S-1 cells to media with or without ACTH decreased remarkably after 11 days of gestation. On days, 3, 5 and 8 of gestation, a significant increase in progesterone release from S-1 cells was noted by the ACTH addition. 20 alpha-OH-progesterone release from S-1 cells to media with or without ACTH decreased as the pregnancy advanced. Total cAMP of intra- and extra-cellular S-1 cells (Group II) on day 5 after PMS injection was assayed. ACTH induced an increase in intracellular cAMP. The present results indicate the following: (1) In Group I and Group II, progesterone release increased with the age of the luteal cells and ACTH dose. In Group III, ACTH stimulated progesterone release in a dose-dependent manner in early gestation. (2) 20 alpha-OH-progesterone release decreased by ACTH dose in Group I and Group II, and decreased in Group III as the gestation advanced. (3) Intracellular cAMP increased by ACTH in Group II.

15885331|t|Perceived qualitative benefits of cochlear implants in children with multi-handicaps.
15885331|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine families' perceived benefits of cochlear implants in children with multiple-handicaps. METHODS: Parents/guardians of a child with a cochlear implant for at least 3 months, under the age of 18 years and had least one additional disability were recruited for participation through rehabilitation therapists. Families who did not have a child enrolled in therapy at the study center were contacted by mail. Families were asked a number of open-ended and close-ended questions. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed, with answers to open-ended questions coded by themes. RESULTS: We interviewed 19 families of 20 children and included 15 families of 16 children who had had at least 6 months of cochlear implant experience for this study. The mean time between implantation and study was 3 years (S.D.+/-2.2) with a range of 0.5-8 years. Children were highly compliant in wearing their device. Sixty-eight percent (11/16) of the children were enrolled in additional therapies beyond speech and aural rehabilitation therapies. Fifty percent of families (8/16) indicated they had no obstacles to accessing therapies. Insurance was the most common barrier to accessing therapies (18% of respondents). All children made communication progress post-implant as described by their families. All families felt that the cochlear implant team provided enough information prior to receiving the implant to help families make the appropriate decision about implanting their child. All families said that if they were to make the decision again, they would choose to have their child implanted. CONCLUSION: More children with multiple-handicaps are receiving cochlear implants. Very young children may undergo cochlear implantation only to be subsequently diagnosed with an additional impairment or disability at later ages. As a result, it is important to understand the specific needs of this population and the parental perceptions of benefit in order to provide the best services and opportunities for success with a cochlear implant. Although not all of the children gained gold standard speech and language outcomes, all children broadened their communication skills. In motivated families of children with additional disabilities, it is appropriate to provide them with the same opportunity to access audition and expand their communication abilities as any other child with a hearing impairment.

3486104|t|Relative abuse of diazepam and oxazepam: prescription forgeries and theft/loss reports in Sweden.
3486104|a|Results of previous laboratory studies in humans suggest that the benzodiazepine diazepam has greater abuse liability than the benzodiazepine oxazepam. The validity of these laboratory-based experimental data were examined by analyzing Swedish data on drug abuse. Sales and prescription data showed that use of diazepam was somewhat lower than oxazepam, but of the same general order of magnitude (0.8:1). Prescription data showed that the drugs were prescribed for the same diagnostic indications. After adjustment for differences in use, 'prescription forgeries' and 'mentions in theft and loss reports' were found to be more frequent for diazepam than for oxazepam (2.3:1 and 2.5:1 for forgeries and theft/loss reports, respectively). This effect was consistent for each year examined (1982, 1983, 1984) and occurred when the data were recalculated to exclude Valium, the original and most widely known brand of diazepam. Finally, this pattern with prescription forgeries occurred across different geographical regions in Sweden (1982, 1983).

1319766|t|Screening for high- and low-risk human papillomavirus types in single routine cervical smears by non-isotopic in situ hybridization.
1319766|a|Routine cervical smears (n = 262) from a Sexually Transmitted Diseases clinic were screened by non-isotopic in situ hybridization (NISH) stratifying human papillomavirus (HPV) infections into HPV6/11 (low risk) and HPV16/18/33 (high risk) categories. Of 188 patients with cytologically normal smears, HPV sequences were demonstrated in 41%. Of the 128 cases analysed by dual NISH, 16% contained low risk, 20% high risk and 5% both groups. In patients with cytological evidence of wart virus infection (WVI) only, 54% (n = 50) contained high-risk and 22% low-risk HPV types. The comparable incidences in CIN1/2 plus WVI (n = 24) were not significantly different: 54% and 17%, respectively. Cytological criteria underestimate the prevalence of HPV infection in patients with cytologically normal smears. This represents either 'occult' or 'latent' infection. The identical prevalence of HPVB16/18/33 in WVI only, and CIN1/2 plus WVI, suggests that the cytopathic effect induced by these HPVs may represent one end of a spectrum of morphological change which progresses to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

10086726|t|Low BCL-2 expression in acute leukemia with t(8;21) chromosomal abnormality.
10086726|a|In de novo t(8;21) AML which shows terminal neutrophilic differentiation, the BCL-2 expression was found to be significantly lower than that in types of other AML regardless of the phenotypic differentiation status. An inverse correlation between BCL-2 expression and the S/G2/M population cells was observed in AML. The S/G2/M population in t(8;21)AML was larger than in the other types of AML. In t(8;21)AML, spontaneous apoptosis after a 12-h liquid culture was prominent, and the autonomous DNA synthesis after a 72-h liquid culture was low. G-CSF and IL-5 promoted the colony formation of t(8;21)AML cells. The data suggest that, in vivo, the low BCL-2 in t(8;21)AML induced entry of cells from the G0/G1 phase to S phase, but the cells easily die by apoptosis, in vitro. The low BCL-2 expression and the supportive effects of G-CSF and IL-5 in t(8;21)AML is thought to be a key phenomenon which might be related to the formation of the in vivo blood picture, such as prominent neutrophilic differentiation and eosinophilia. Cellular extracts from t(8;21)AML cell line Kasumi-1 bound to both the AML1 and CRE binding sites in the bcl-2 promoter, but none of the cellular extracts from de novo t(8;21)AML bound to either of these sites. The DNA binding activity of transactivators in de novo t(8;21)AML is different from that in Kasumi-1 cells probably due to the phosphorylation status.

3485116|t|Marrow involvement with T cell lymphoma initially presenting as abnormal myelopoiesis.
3485116|a|Three cases of T cell lymphoma affecting the marrow, in which initial bone marrow appearances were misleading, occurred. In each case the initial clinical presentation was related to cytopenia, but the marrow abnormalities at this time suggested an abnormal myeloid proliferative state, with no evidence of a malignant lymphoid proliferation. Later in the course of the disease, however, the characteristic pattern of marrow infiltration by mature post-thymic T cells became evident. The consequent delay (two to 36 months) in diagnosis was noted.

10898519|t|The very small-conductance K+ channel KvLQT1 and epithelial function.
10898519|a|KvLQT1 (KCNQ1) is a very small conductance K+ channel distributed widely in epithelial and non-epithelial tissues. Its specific biophysical and pharmacological properties are determined by the regulatory subunits IsK (KCNE1) and MiRP2 (KCNE3). In epithelial cells of the inner ear, pancreas, and airways it interacts with IsK to conduct a voltage-gated and slowly activating K+ current. In the colon it coassembles with KCNE3 to conduct an instantaneous and constitutively active K+ current. In Cl- secretory epithelia, such as the colon and pancreas, this K+ channel provides the driving force for Cl- exit and is located in the basolateral membrane. In the inner ear it enables luminal secretion of K+ into the endolymphatic space. The functional relevance of KvLQT1 to epithelial function is revealed by blocking it pharmacologically or by studying animals with a genetic defect for it, which result in the breakdown of colonic Cl- secretion and endolymph production, respectively. KvLQT1 K+ channels are activated via cAMP or Ca2+ and inhibited by the chromanol 293B. Interaction with as yet unknown regulatory subunits may determine the properties of KvLQT1 in the rectal gland and other epithelial tissues in which KvLQT1 is not inhibited by chromanols.

2928645|t|Damaging effect of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 on chick embryo cells in vitro.
2928645|a|The lethal effect of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) on rabbits and chick embryos is enhanced in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In an investigation of the mode of action of TSST-1, its effect-both singly and in combination with LPS-on tissue culture cell lines was examined. Of a variety of cell lines examined for sensitivity to TSST-1 treatment, only primary chick embryo cells were susceptible. At a critical concentration (0.2 microgram/mL), TSST-1 alone caused detachment of the cell monolayer. In contrast, LPS per se had no visible effect on the cells at any concentration tested. TSST-1 in combination with LPS caused monolayer detachment at all concentrations of TSST-1 employed; thus detachment was independent of TSST-1 concentration in the presence of LPS. The ability of TSST-1 to disrupt the monolayer was neutralized in the presence of polyclonal rabbit antiserum to TSST-1. In a time course study over 24 hours, the effect of the toxin on the cells was initially visible by light microscopy after 4-7 hours. Clear differences in cellular morphology between TSST-1 treated monolayers and untreated controls were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Treated cells lost their normal spindle-shaped appearance before detachment.

3337484|t|Myocardial infarct extension: occurrence, outcome, and risk factors in the Multicenter Investigation of Limitation of Infarct Size.
3337484|a|The occurrence, outcome, and predictors of myocardial infarct extension were determined in 848 patients with acute myocardial infarction. An increase in the level of plasma MB creatine kinase activity was used to detect extension, which occurred in 71 of 848 patients (8.4%). For these patients, hospital mortality was more than four times higher than for those without extension (30% versus 7%, P less than 0.01). However, for patients surviving the initial hospitalization, there was no significant difference in mortality during the following year (12% compared with 9%). Multivariable analyses indicated that extension was more likely to occur in patients with recurrent ischemic pain during the second hospital day, a history of previous myocardial infarction, and ST segment depression on the admission electrocardiogram. The occurrence of extension in patients with two of these risk factors was more than twice that of patients without any of the risk factors (15.1% compared with 5.8%). Patients with these risk factors should be considered for early coronary angiography and possible intervention to prevent infarct extension and its sequellae.

18189206|a|In a community-based cross-sectional survey among out-of-treatment male opiate injecting drug users (IDU) aged 18-45, data on non-fatal overdose were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. From August to September 2003, 299 IDU were recruited in two districts of Bac Ninh, a semi-urban province in North Vietnam. Prevalence of lifetime and recent non-fatal overdose were 43.5 and 83.1%, respectively. Logistic regression analyses showed associations between non-fatal overdose and younger age, unemployment, residence in the provincial township, frequency of injecting, injecting heroin mixed with valium, and history of drug treatment. While recognizing the limitations of this study, it is the first in Southeast Asia to report on prevalence of drug use-related overdose. Future research is recommended on occurrence of fatal overdose in this population.

Of the 3 proposed causes of such cysts, torsion of a pre-existing dermoid, leading to autoamputation and subsequent reimplantation, is most likely the preceding event. A rare case of a parasitic benign cystic teratoma was incidentally found in the pouch of Douglas in a 29-year-old woman undergoing a laparoscopic right cystectomy for an ovarian dermoid cyst.

6349861|a|A sandwich enzyme immunoassay method for measurement of beta subunit of muscle enolase in human serum was developed by use of purified antibodies to enolase beta subunit and beta-D-galactosidase from Escherichia coli as label. The assay was specific to the beta subunit with no cross-reaction with the alpha and gamma subunits of human enolase. The measurable range was from 10 pg to 10 ng per assay tube or 1 to 1000 ng/ml serum. Coefficients of variation within-run and between-run for the assay of serum beta subunit were less than 14%. Normal adult sera contained about 6 ng/ml of the beta subunit, and the levels were significantly elevated in sera of patients with muscular dystrophy and those with myocardial infarction. Serum levels of the beta subunit correlated well with those of creatine phosphokinase, but poorly with those of myoglobin in the same samples. The specific distribution of beta subunit in skeletal muscle and heart was confirmed by measuring the levels in various tissue extracts.

3259938|t|Ductal morphogenesis in the mouse mammary gland: evidence supporting a role for epidermal growth factor.
3259938|a|Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent mitogen for a variety of cells in vitro, but studies on its effects in vivo and its possible role as a natural growth regulator are few. Using slow-release plastic implants, capable of delivering EGF to small regions of the gland over a period of several days, we have shown that EGF reinitiated ductal growth and morphogenesis in growth-static glands of ovariectomized mice. The effects of implanted EGF were confined to the zone around the implant and were time and dose dependent. Unimplanted glands in the same animal were unaffected. Local effects included (1) the formation of new ductal growth points (end buds), (2) the restoration of normal end bud histomorphology and the reappearance of a stem (cap) cell layer, (3) the reinitiation of epithelial DNA synthesis, and (4) an increase in ductal diameter. No lobulo-alveolar or hyperplastic growth was seen. Competitive binding assays and autoradiography were used to characterize EGF receptor activity in growing and static glands. High and low affinity receptors were demonstrated in each tissue, while 125I-EGF autoradiography revealed differential, specific binding of the ligand to certain epithelial and stromal elements. In the epithelium, label was concentrated in the cap cells of the end buds and in myoepithelial cells of the mammary ducts. Stromal cell label was heaviest adjacent to the epithelium in the end bud flank and subtending ducts, suggesting the induction of stromal EGF receptors by mammary epithelium. Because exogenous EGF is both a mitogenic and morphogenetic factor in this tissue and can serve as a locally acting substitute for known systemic mammogens such as estrogen and prolactin, it must be considered a strong candidate for a naturally occurring mammary tissue mitogen.

2681666|t|Placental transport of calcium and phosphorus in pigs.
2681666|a|The role of vitamin D in regulating placental transport of calcium and phosphate in pigs was studied using the "Hannover Pig Strain" which suffers from pseudo-vitamin D-deficiency rickets, type I. Sows and fetuses of normal phenotype (heterozygotes) and of homozygote phenotype which suffered from clinical symptoms of rickets were used. The homozygote animals are devoid of renal 25-cholecalciferol-1-hydroxylase. In the rachitic sows which normally depend on treatment with pharmacological doses of vitamin D3 at intervals of four to six weeks, vitamin D-treatment was discontinued two months before conception. Ca, P and 1.25-(OH)2D3 concentrations in plasma of sows and fetuses (Aa. umb., V. umb.) were measured in samples obtained at term during cesarian section. Mean concentrations of Ca and P in heterozygote sows at parturition were 2.34 mmol/l and 2.33 mmol/l, respectively, and were significantly higher than in homozygote sows, 1.58 mmol/l and 1.26 mmol/l, respectively. Ca concentrations in plasma of the umbilical vein of fetuses from both homozygote and heterozygote sows were normal, however, (3.23 mmol/l and 2.96 mmol/l, respectively) and statistically not different from each other. No significantly different P concentrations in arterial plasma of fetuses from heterozygote or homozygote sows were seen, either. The concentrations of Ca and P in the arterial umbilical plasma were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than in venous plasma of both homozygote and heterozygote fetuses, indicating net placental transfer of these elements in both genotypes. The concentration of 1.25-(OH)2D3 in hypocalcemic sows at term (25.5 +/- 8.25 pg/ml) was significantly lower than that in the normocalcemic (heterozygote) sows (84.1 +/- 25.6 pg/ml). The 1.25-(OH)2D3 concentration in arterial plasma of fetuses from homozygote sows was only 46% that of fetuses from normocalcemic sows which showed transfer of calcitriol from mother to fetus. It is concluded from these studies that in pigs, renal production and physiological concentrations of 1.25-(OH)2D3 in either mother or fetus is not essential for the maintainance of the Ca and P homeostasis in the fetal-maternal system.

16305800|t|Crystal structure of human BACE2 in complex with a hydroxyethylamine transition-state inhibitor.
16305800|a|BACE2 is a membrane-bound aspartic protease of the A1 family with a high level of sequence homology to BACE1. While BACE1 is involved in the generation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease by cleaving Abeta-peptides from the amyloid precursor protein, the physiological function of BACE2 is not well understood. BACE2 appears to be associated with the early onset of dementia in patients with Down's syndrome, and it has been shown to be highly expressed in breast cancers. Further, it may participate in the function of normal and abnormal processes of human muscle biology. Similar to other aspartic proteases, BACE2 is expressed as an inactive zymogen requiring the cleavage of its pro-sequence during the maturation process. We have produced mature BACE2 by expression of pro-BACE2 in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, followed by refolding and autocatalytic activation at pH 3.4. Using a C and N-terminally truncated BACE2 variant, we were able to crystallize and determine the crystal structure of mature BACE2 in complex with a hydroxyethylamine transition-state mimetic inhibitor at 3.1 angstroms resolution. The structure of BACE2 follows the general fold of A1 aspartic proteases. However, similar to BACE1, its C-terminal domain is significantly larger than that of the other family members. Furthermore, the structure of BACE2 reveals differences in the S3, S2, S1' and S2' active site substrate pockets as compared to BACE1, and allows, therefore, for a deeper understanding of the structural features that may facilitate the design of selective BACE1 or BACE2 inhibitors.

8771216|t|Evidence against unusual sex concordance and pseudoautosomal inheritance in the catatonic subtype of schizophrenia.
8771216|a|The study is based on sibships with multiply afflicted members derived from a family study of consecutively admitted probands with catatonic schizophrenia. As shown recently, the clinical subtype of periodic catatonia, as defined by Leonhard, is compatible with a major gene effect and genetic anticipation; that is, the age of illness onset of the probands is significantly earlier than that of their parents. In the present study, 83 probands with the clinical subtype of periodic catatonia had 26 afflicted siblings that were distributed among 23 families. We analyzed sex-concordance and pseudoautosomal inheritance patterns. Stratifying the 26 afflicted siblings by sibship size and by the proband's sex, we did not find unusual sex-concordance rates in sibships afflicted with periodic catatonia. Further, there was no association between sex concordance and maternal or paternal origin of the disease. Thus, our results provide strong evidence against pseudoautosomal inheritance or sex-linked transmission in affected sibships in the obviously familial schizophrenic subtype of periodic catatonia.

17500546|t|Vibrational spectroscopy of protonated imidazole and its complexes with water molecules: ab initio anharmonic calculations and experiments.
17500546|a|The results of anharmonic frequency calculations on neutral imidazole (C3N2H4, Im), protonated imidazole (ImH+), and its complexes with water (ImH+)(H2O)n, are presented and compared to gas phase infrared photodissociation spectroscopy (IRPD) data. Anharmonic frequencies are obtained via ab initio vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) calculations taking into account pairwise interactions between the normal modes. The key results are: (1) Prediction of anharmonic vibrational frequencies on an MP2 ab initio potential energy surface show excellent agreement with experiment and outstanding improvement over the harmonic frequencies. For example, the ab initio calculated anharmonic frequency for (ImH+)(H2O)N2 exhibits an overall average percentage error of 0.6% from experiment. (2) Anharmonic vibrational frequencies calculated on a semiempirical potential energy surface fitted to ab initio harmonic data represents spectroscopy well, particularly for water complexes. As an example, anharmonic frequencies for (ImH+)H2O and (ImH+)(H2O)2 show an overall average deviation of 1.02% and 1.05% from experiment, respectively. This agreement between theory and experiment also supports the validity and use of the pairwise approximation used in the calculations. (3) Anharmonic coupling due to hydration effects is found to significantly reduce the vibrational frequencies for the NH stretch modes. The frequency of the NH stretch is observed to increase with the removal of a water molecule or replacement of water with N2. This result also indicates the ability of the VSCF method to predict accurate frequencies in a matrix environment. The calculation provides insights into the nature of anharmonic effects in the potential surface. Analysis of percentage anharmoncity in neutral Im and ImH+ shows a higher percentage anharmonicity in the NH and CH stretch modes of neutral Im. Also, we observe that anharmonicity in the NH stretch modes of ImH+ have some contribution from coupling effects, while that of neutral Im has no contribution whatsoever from mode-mode coupling. It is concluded that the incorporation of anharmonic effects in the calculation brings theory and experiment into much closer agreement for these systems.

1860062|t|Hippocampal mossy fiber zinc deficit in mice genetically selected for ethanol withdrawal seizure susceptibility.
1860062|a|Hippocampal mossy fiber zinc was examined in mice selectively bred for differences in susceptibility to handling-induced convulsions during ethanol withdrawal. The density of mossy fiber zinc in the CA3 stratum lucidum was significantly decreased in the duplicate lines of untreated withdrawal seizure prone (WSP) mice compared to untreated withdrawal seizure resistant (WSR) mice. Mossy fiber zinc densities in randomly bred control lines of mice (WSC) were intermediate to WSP and WSR mice. Serum, whole brain and whole hippocampal zinc were not significantly different between WSP and WSR mice, indicating that the reduction in the chelatable pool of hippocampal mossy fiber zinc was not a consequence of deficits in brain or whole body zinc nutrition. A highly significant correlation between hippocampal mossy fiber zinc density and handling-induced convulsion indices suggests that a reduction in mossy fiber zinc may be one contributing factor in the expression of seizure susceptibility in WSP mice.

16506079|t|A dose-finding study of duloxetine based on serotonin transporter occupancy.
16506079|a|RATIONALE: Positron emission tomography (PET) has been utilized for determining the dosage of antipsychotic drugs. To evaluate the dosage of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin transporter occupancy (5-HTT) is also a useful index. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the degree of 5-HTT occupancy with different doses of the antidepressant duloxetine and the time-course of 5-HTT occupancy using PET. METHODS: PET scans with [11C]DASB were performed before and after a single administration of duloxetine (5-60 mg), and three consecutive scans were performed after a single dose or repeated doses of 60 mg of duloxetine. RESULTS: 5-HTT occupancies by duloxetine were increased by 35.3 to 86.5% with dose and plasma concentration increments. The ED50 value of 5-HTT occupancy was 7.9 mg for dose and 3.7 ng/ml for plasma concentration. In the time-course of 5-HTT occupancy, mean occupancies were 81.8% at 6 h, 71.9% at 25 h, and 44.9% at 53 h after a single administration, and 84.3% at 6 h, 71.9% at 49 h, and 47.1% at 78 h after repeated administrations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on 5-HTT occupancy, 40 mg and more of duloxetine was needed to attain 80% occupancy, and 60 mg of duloxetine could maintain a high level of 5-HTT occupancy with a once-a-day administration schedule.

16814362|t|Effect of precursor concentration on the characteristics of nanoscale zerovalent iron and its reactivity of nitrate.
16814362|a|Differing precursor concentrations, 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 M FeCl(3) x 6H(2)O, were performed to produce nanoscale Fe(0) and the results were discussed in terms of the specific surface area, particle size and electrochemical properties. The results indicated that the nanoscale Fe(0) prepared by 0.01 M FeCl(3) had absolutely reduced in size (9-10nm) and possessed the greatest specific surface area (56.67 m(2) g(-1)). These synthesized nanoscale Fe(0) particles were attempted to enhance the removal of 40 mg-NL(-1) unbuffered nitrate solution. The first-order degradation rate constants (k(obs)) increased significantly (5.5-8.6 times) with nanoscale Fe(0) prepared by 0.01 M precursor solution (Fe(0.01 M)(0)). When normalized to iron surface area concentration, the specific rate constant (k(SA)) was increased by a factor of approximately 1.7-2.4 using Fe(0.01 M)(0) (6.84 x 10(-4) L min(-1) m(-2) for Fe(0.01 M)(0), 4.04 x 10(-4) L min(-1) m(-2) for Fe(0.1 M)(0) and 2.80 x 10(-4) L min(-1) m(-2) for Fe(1 M)(0)). The rise of reactivity of the reactive site on the Fe(0.01 M)(0) surface was indicated by the specific rate constant (k(SA)) calculation and the i(0) value of the electrochemical test.

16332927|t|Sepsis induces changes in the expression and distribution of Toll-like receptor 4 in the rat kidney.
16332927|a|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are now recognized as the major receptors for microbial pathogens on cells of the innate immune system. Recently, TLRs were also identified in many organs including the kidney. However, the cellular distribution and role of these renal TLRs remain largely unknown. In this paper, we investigated the expression of TLR4 in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis in Sprague-Dawley rats utilizing fluorescence microscopy. In sham animals, TLR4 was expressed predominantly in Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP)-positive tubules. In CLP animals, TLR4 expression increased markedly in all tubules (proximal and distal), glomeruli, and the renal vasculature. The staining showed a strong apical distribution in all tubules. A moderately less intense cellular signal colocalized partially with the Golgi apparatus. In addition, kidneys from septic rats showed increased expression of CD14 and THP. They each colocalized strongly with TLR4, albeit in different tubular segments. We also imaged the kidneys of live septic animals with two-photon microscopy after fluorescent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Within 10 min, LPS was seen at the brush border of some proximal tubules. Within 60 min, LPS was fully cytoplasmic in proximal tubules. Conversely, distal tubules showed no LPS uptake. We conclude that TLR4, CD14, and THP have specific renal cellular and tubular expression patterns that are markedly affected by sepsis. Systemic endotoxin can freely access the tubular and cellular sites where these proteins are present. Therefore, locally expressed TLRs and other interacting proteins could potentially modulate the renal response to systemic sepsis.

12964077|t|[Film-screen mammography versus digital storage plate mammography: hard copy and monitor display of microcalcifications and focal findings--a retrospective clinical and histologic analysis]
12964077|a|PURPOSE: A retrospective clinical-histological study to determine the diagnostic accuracy of mammography using conventional screen-film cassettes (hard copy), high-resolution digital phosphor storage plates (hard copy) and monitor display (soft copy) for microcalcifications and focal lesions (BI-RADS (TM) category 4 or 5). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April to November 2001, 76 patients underwent conventional film-screen mammography and, after diagnosis and preoperative wire localization, digital mammography with the same exposure parameters. Five investigators retrospectively determined the diagnosis after the operation from randomly distributed mediolateral views (hard-copy reading) and from the monitor display (soft-copy reading). These results were correlated with the final histology. RESULTS: The accuracy of conventional screen-film mammography, digital mammography and monitor-displayed mammography was 67%, 65% and 68% for all findings, (n = 76), 59%, 59% and 68% for microcalcifications (n = 44) and 75%, 72% and 63% for focal lesions (n = 32). The overall results showed no difference. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate equivalence of conventional screen-film mammography, high-resolution digital phosphor storage plate mammography and monitor-displayed mammography.

8908258|t|Persistence of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae in adenoid macrophages: a putative colonization mechanism.
8908258|a|That nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHI) can reside intracellularly in human adenoid tissue has been suggested by use of in situ hybridization of a fluorescein labelled 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe (FISH). Adenoid tissues from 43 children operated on in a clinically infection-free interval were investigated. FISH revealed H. influenzae in macrophage-like cells, located subepithelially in the crypts in all 43 adenoids. Furthermore, H. influenzae was detected in 22/22 adenoids using immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody MAHI-3 recognizing a conserved H. influenzae LPS inner-core region. FISH and staining with monoclonal antibodies against immunophenotypic markers were performed simultaneously in order to characterize the cellular interrelations in this microenvironment. The findings of widespread presence of H. influenzae in cells of which some strongly expressed the CD14 marker of the monocyte/macrophage lineage may correspond to an important aspect of the colonization mechanisms whereby NTHI persists in the nasopharynx of children.

15163226|t|Clear cell ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas: a case report and review of the literature.
15163226|a|We present a unique carcinoma of the pancreas with predominantly clear cell morphology (>95% clear cells). Mucicarmine stain revealed abundant intraluminal and intracytoplasmic mucin. Immunohistochemically, the cells were positive for the epithelial markers cytokeratin 7 and CAM 5.2, and were focally positive for cytokeratin 20. These cells also expressed monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen. Stains for the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and chromogranin were negative, as were stains for vimentin, p53, HMB-45, and CD10. An additional outstanding feature was the presence of dense intraluminal and intracytoplasmic hyaline globules, which were immunohistochemically positive for alpha1-antitrypsin. Sequencing of the K-ras oncogene revealed a point mutation in codon 12, providing molecular evidence of ductal origin. In the proper morphologic context supported by immunohistochemistry, clear cell carcinoma can be regarded as a rare variant of ductal adenocarcinoma.

2035577|t|Behavioral changes in fetal sheep caused by vibroacoustic stimulation: the effects of cochlear ablation.
2035577|a|We measured the effects of 2 minutes of vibroacoustic stimulation on the activity of unanesthetized fetal sheep in utero. We were unable to detect any changes in activity after stimulation with a model 5C electrolarynx. With more powerful stimulation using a mechanical oscillator, fetal electrocortical activity desynchronized. Fetal breathing and eye movements changed with electrocortical activity and there was an increase in nuchal muscle activity. Stimulation caused a small decrease in fetal heart rate. Responses to stimulation were not seen in four of the five fetuses with bilateral cochlear ablation. These results indicate that in fetal sheep the auditory apparatus is necessary for the detection of vibroacoustic stimuli. The difference in responsiveness of the sheep and human fetus appears to be because of a difference in central processing after detection of the stimulus.

17169865|t|Effects of nitrogen dioxide on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, neutrophil adhesion, and cytotoxicity: studies in human bronchial epithelial cells.
17169865|a|Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is a product of high-temperature combustion and an environmental oxidant of concern. We have recently reported that early changes in NO2-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells are causally linked to increased generation of proinflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide/nitrite and cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-8. The objective of the present in vitro study was to further delineate the cellular mechanisms of NO2-mediated toxicity, and to define the nature of cell death that ensues upon exposure of normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells to a brief high dose of NO2. Our results demonstrate that the NHBE cells undergo apoptotic cell death during the early post-NO2 period, but this is independent of any significant increase in caspase-3 activity. However, necrotic cell death was more prevalent at later time intervals. Interestingly, an increased expression of HO-1, a redox-sensitive stress protein, was observed in NO2-exposed NHBE cells at 24 h. Since neutrophils (PMNs) play an active role in acute lung inflammation and resultant oxidative injury, we also investigated changes in human PMN-NHBE cell interactions. As compared to normal cells, increased adhesion of PMNs to NO2-exposed cells was observed, which resulted in an increased NHBE cell death. The latter was also increased in the presence of IL-8 and TNF-alpha + interferon (IFN)-gamma, which correlated with upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Our results confirmed an involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in NO2-induced cytotoxicity. By using NO synthase inhibitors such as L-NAME and 3-aminoguanidine (AG), a significant decrease in cell death, PMN adhesion, and ICAM-1 expression was observed. These findings indicate a role for the L-arginine/NO synthase pathway in the observed NO2-mediated toxicity in NHBE cells. Therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling excess generation of NO and/or inflammatory cytokines may be useful in alleviating NO2-mediated adverse effects on the bronchial epithelium.

This is a valuable, scientific foundation-that uses the highest relevant standard of evidence-for the role of law as a public health tool.

1940791|t|COOH terminus of membrane IgM is essential for an antigen-specific induction of some but not all early activation events in mature B cells.
1940791|a|Transfectants of mature B cell lines that bind phosphorylcholine were made in order to understand the role of the COOH terminus of the mu chain of membrane IgM (mIgM) in generation of antigen-specific signals. A chimeric receptor (I-A alpha tail) was constructed by replacing 40 amino acids from the mu COOH terminus with that of major histocompatibility complex class II I-A alpha chain. The effect of wild-type and chimeric tails were studied on representative immediate-early antigen-specific signals. The I-A alpha tail hybrid, but not the wild-type receptor, was defective in antigen-driven Ca2+ mobilization, although it could effectively endocytose ligand-receptor complexes. Signal(s) transduced through the wild-type receptor led to transient induction of selected immediate-early gene messages (Egr-1, c-fos, Jun) above basal levels. However, the signal(s) generated after crosslinking of the I-A alpha tail receptor either showed no effect (c-fos) or actually repressed basal level expression of Egr-1 and Jun. Thus, we have established that receptor-mediated endocytosis can be distinguished from other early events associated with B cell activation, based on their differential dependence upon the structural fidelity of the COOH-terminal sequence of mIgM.

3098140|t|Influence of sublingual nitroglycerin on the digital circulation of man.
3098140|a|By means of the digital rheoplethysmographic (RPG) method, the effect of sublingually administered nitroglycerin (NTG), 1/200 gr (0.3 mg), on the digital circulation was studied in 17 normal subjects and 5 patients with ischemic heart disease and angina pectoris. NTG produced dilatation of all digital vessels, reflected especially by increases in total digital volume. NTG produced marked changes in the dicrotic notch of the pulse wave, noted also in inflow volume curves but not in outflow volume curves. The dicrotic notch was displaced later on the descending limb of the digital pulse wave and became deeper and more prominent after NTG. It is suggested that NTG produces disproportionate dilatation of the arterial system, having its greatest effect on arteries near the heart, including the coronaries and great vessels branching off the aorta, and on left intraventricular cavity pressure. This greater regional vasodilatation of vessels near the heart could delay closure of the aortic valve, producing a delayed and prominent dicrotic notch of the pulse wave.

8020086|t|Re-examination of recent trends in under five mortality rates in Zimbabwe: evidence from the ZDHS, 1988.
8020086|a|Prior studies on infant and child mortality in Zimbabwe have questioned the low mortality found in Matabaleland South. It was suspected that it could be an artefact of data. Using the ZDHS data, this study has shown that the probability of dying before age five (q(5)) is indeed low in Matabeleland South. Also while all provinces experienced a temporary rise in mortality in the 1980's that of Matabeleland was experienced over the period 1980-82, a period marked by political turmoil. In the mid 1980's when things had normalised, mortality in Matabeleland South experienced a decline while other provinces experienced a temporary rise in q(5).

8392946|t|Generation of superoxide by purified and relipidated cytochrome b559 in the absence of cytosolic activators.
8392946|a|Purified cytochrome b559 from guinea pig macrophages was relipidated with several phospholipid mixtures. Relipidated cytochrome b559 was found capable of NADPH-dependent superoxide (O2-) production in the absence of the cytosolic components of the NADPH oxidase complex. The rate of O2- generation by cytochrome b559 varied with the type of phospholipid utilized for relipidation, was absolutely dependent on exogenous FAD, and was enhanced by a critical concentration of anionic amphiphile. It is demonstrated that exogenous FAD acts by binding to cytochrome b559. These results provide firm experimental evidence for the proposal that cytochrome b559 comprises the complete electron transporting apparatus of the O2- forming NADPH oxidase and that the cytosolic components function merely as activators.

12421256|t|Childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in Turkey.
12421256|a|BACKGROUND: It has been reported that there are racial and regional differences in peak incidence age, histopathological features and response to steroid therapy in childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, followed up in 1994-2000, were assessed retrospectively. The aim of this study was to assess the patients' response pattern to steroid therapy, to determine whether the duration of the initial steroid therapy alters the steroid response pattern of the disease and to assess renal biopsy results. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen patients who initially received only steroid therapy and were followed up regularly were classified according to response pattern. Of the 114 patients, 30 children had an initial response, 25 children had infrequent relapse, 19 had frequent relapse, 25 had steroid dependence and 15 children had steroid resistance. The 99 patients with steroid responsive nephrotic syndrome were divided into two groups with respect to duration of the initial steroid therapy. There was no statistically significant difference between standard and short therapy groups with respect to the steroid response patterns. Percutaneous renal biopsy was performed in 43 of the 138 patients. Mesengioproliferative glomerulonephritis was the most common histopathological lesion, followed by membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The proportions of membranous glomerulonephritis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and minimal change nephrotic syndrome were low in our group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study group is similar to one reported from Saudi Arabia with respect to the steroid response pattern and to Saudi Arabian and Nigerian reports with respect to the histopathology. Although it has been reported that short initial steroid therapy was followed by a higher rate of relapses, there was no statistically significant difference between standard and short therapy groups with respect to the relapse rate in our study group.

10453317|t|Metabolic sequelae of cancers (excluding bone marrow transplantation).
10453317|a|The pathogenesis of cancer anorexia/cachexia is still unclear, partly explaining why its treatment remains disappointing. Anorexia plays a central role but cancer cachexia is more complex than chronic starvation. One of the key differences is the preferential mobilization of fat and the sparing of skeletal muscle in simple starvation compared to an equal mobilization of fat and skeletal muscle in cancer patients. An increase in basal energy expenditure also appears to play a contributory role in many patients. Cytokines, essentially but not exclusively tumor necrosis factor-alpha, play an essential pathogenic role and the syndrome can be compared to a low grade chronic inflammatory state. Parenteral nutrition could facilitate the administration of complete doses of chemotherapy or radiotherapy but no significant survival benefit or decrease in treatment-induced toxicity have been demonstrated in prospective randomized trials. The gut should have the preference for nutritional support. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is used more and more often in patients with a functionally intact gastrointestinal tract, especially in patients with head and neck cancer. Progestational drugs can to some extent stimulate appetite, food intake, energy level, increase weight and decrease the severity of nausea and vomiting. However, pharmacological treatment of cancer cachexia remains disappointing and more trials with anticytokine drugs, anabolic agents or polyunsaturated fatty acids should be conducted.

6745722|t|Is raised breath hydrogen related to the pathogenesis of pneumatosis coli?
6745722|a|Clinical and physiological studies were carried out in five patients with pneumatosis coli in order to investigate the origin of the high fasting breath hydrogen concentration in this condition and to determine its possible significance in the pathogenesis of the disease. All five patients excreted abnormally high fasting concentrations of hydrogen in their breath (69 +/- 9 ppm, mean +/- SEM). Moreover, analysis of the contents of the gas filled cysts revealed between 2% and 8% of hydrogen gas. Colonic washout significantly reduced breath hydrogen concentrations to 9 +/- 6 ppm, but did not abolish the cysts. Conversely, deflation of the cysts was achieved with oxygen or antibiotics, though this only reduced breath hydrogen concentrations to about 66% of their original value. After feeding a radiolabelled meal, breath hydrogen concentrations rose before the meal appeared to reach the colon, suggesting overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine. Despite this, 14C glycocholate breath tests were within normal limits. An alternative possibility is that the high levels of hydrogen excreted in the breath may be produced in the intestinal lumen possibly from the fermentation of copious amounts of colonic mucus. Finally, measurement of whole gut transit time and stool weight suggested that patients were constipated despite passing mucus and blood. The relevance of our observations to the pathogenesis of submucosal cysts is unclear, but the data favour the hypothesis that these are produced by invasion of the colonic submucosa with anaerobic bacteria.

4000429|a|Eleven cases of cervical neurinomas with an extradural component were operated on with control of the vertebral artery as the first step of the surgical procedure. The lateral anterior approach was used first in each case with excellent results. In the case of hourglass tumors (seven cases), a complementary posterior approach was performed to remove the intradural portion. Primary control of the vertebral artery in cases of extradural or hourglass neurinoma is a logical and safe procedure in the attempt to achieve complete and bloodless tumor removal.

3281558|t|The effect of storage temperature and physical state on the performance of antisera in radioimmunoassay after long-term storage.
3281558|a|The performance in radioimmunoassay of four antisera after storage at temperatures ranging from -40 degrees C to room temperature, in three physical states (frozen, liquid or freeze dried) was investigated over a 3-year period. No deterioration in antiserum performance in terms of precision and accuracy of quality control serum measurement or recovery of ligand was apparent under any of the storage conditions studied. Some lowering of titre became apparent in two of the antisera over the study period. Deterioration was most marked when antiserum was stored lyophilised at room temperature. Storage of antiserum frozen confers no advantage over storage at 4 degrees C provided precautions are taken to minimise bacterial contamination when storing antiserum in liquid form.

2094443|t|Porcine leptospirosis in Iowa.
2094443|a|The epidemiology of leptospirosis in Iowa swine was examined on the basis of serologic results and herd data from 55 herds in the National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) program and culture results and histories from 578 cases of reproductive failure submitted to the Iowa Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory during a 3-year period. Thirty-eight percent of sera from NAHMS herds contained antibodies against 1 or more of 12 leptospira antigens. Leptospires were isolated from 9 (1.6%) of 578 cases of reproductive failure. Seven (78%) of the isolates were identified as Leptospira interrogans serovar kennewicki and 2 (22%) as serovar grippotyphosa. In 7 herds from which leptospires were isolated, attack rates ranged from 1% to 84%. Clinical leptospirosis, characterized by reproductive failure and confirmed by isolation of leptospires, was sporadic. No significant differences in farrowing averages and reproductive problems were observed between vaccinated and nonvaccinated NAHMS herds or between herds with higher (43-63%) or lower (14-40%) percentages of animals that were serologically positive against serovar bratislava.

2539321|t|Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders in heart-lung transplant recipients: primary presentation in the allograft.
2539321|a|Heart-lung transplant recipients are predisposed to acute rejection episodes, bronchiolitis obliterans, and opportunistic infections. In 9.4% of recipients at the University of Pittsburgh, a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed, and in 60% of cases, it presented in the allografted lungs and was associated with primary infection by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The PTLD is histologically indistinguishable from a primary pulmonary lymphoma and consists of a mixed population of large lymphoid cells, immunoblasts, and plasma cells. Two cases of PTLD were monoclonal with immunohistochemical and Southern blot analysis. Despite this, there was clinical recovery with reduced immunosuppression and acyclovir. We discuss the role of EBV in the development of PTLD and the pathogenesis of primary presentation in the allograft.

2444404|t|A molecular analysis of mouse development from 8 to 10 days post coitum detects changes only in embryonic globin expression.
2444404|a|The pattern of protein synthesis in 8-, 9- and 10-day post coitum (p.c.) mouse embryos was examined by 2-D gel electrophoresis of [35S]methionine-labelled proteins. Of the 600-800 polypeptides detected only one, a 14 X 10(3) Mr (14K) protein, was found to accumulate over this period. To isolate cDNA clones that potentially encode this protein, 32P-labelled cDNA was synthesized from 9 and 10 days p.c. embryo poly(A) +RNA, and used for the differential screening of an 8.5-day p.c. mouse embryo cDNA library cloned in lambda gt10. Six clones that hybridized strongly to the 10-day probe were purified and their inserts subcloned into plasmid vectors. Cross hybridization and restriction mapping of these inserts indicate that they fall into four distinct groups. Each of these hybridize with transcripts of approximately 600 nucleotides, which accumulate in the embryo from 9 to 10 days p.c. Expression was barely detectable in adult tissues and restricted to liver and spleen. Expression of one of these clones, 10.1, was examined by in situ hybridization of 35S-labelled RNA probes to 8.5-12.5 day p.c. embryo sections. Strong hybridization was observed in yolk sac blood islands, fetal liver and embryonic erythrocytes, suggesting that 10.1A encodes an erythrocyte-specific protein. DNA sequence analysis indicates that the four classes of cDNA were derived from transcripts of the alpha 1, zeta, beta h1 and epsilon globin genes. Labelling of 10-day p.c. erythrocyte proteins with [35S]methionine, followed by 2-D gel electrophoresis, clearly demonstrates that the most abundant polypeptide migrates to the same position as the 14K protein which accumulates from 8 to 10 days p.c. Thus the only abundant transcripts and corresponding proteins that change over a period of profound morphogenetic change correspond to globins of the newly established blood system.

18566760|t|Functional long-term outcome of the shoulder after antegrade intramedullary nailing in humeral diaphyseal fractures.
18566760|a|Intramedullary nailing is one of the most commonly used surgical treatments for humeral diaphyseal fractures. Once an intramedullary fixation technique has been selected, the choice between antegrade or retrograde approach remains controversial. Forty patients with humeral diaphyseal fracture treated with Seidel antegrade intramedullary nailing through an "danterior deltoid incision" (ADI) were evaluated after an average period of 62 months. Clinical and functional evaluation of the shoulder was performed using the Constant Score. Results were excellent in 33 patients, good in 5 and acceptable in 2. Radiological assessment was performed using antero-posterior (AP) and latero-lateral (LL) radiographs of the humerus and AP and Neer radiographs of the shoulder. Radiographic findings demonstrated good consolidation of all fractures; nail and locking proximal screw malpositioning were detected in 2 cases (2 patients with acceptable results). The positive results obtained for shoulder function correlate with patient age and demonstrate that antegrade intramedullary nailing is a valid option for the treatment of humeral diaphyseal fractures, as long as it is performed through ADI access and with the appropriate surgical technique. Surgical technical errors will lead to functional problems of the shoulder, which in some cases will not be completely eliminated even after nail removal.

11410502|t|Prediction of peritoneal micrometastasis by peritoneal lavaged cytology and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for matrix metalloproteinase-7 mRNA.
11410502|a|PURPOSE: Peritoneal dissemination is the most common cause of death associated with gastric cancer. In this study, we report the significance of molecular diagnosis of peritoneal dissemination by means of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assay using preoperative peritoneal wash fluid. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Preoperative peritoneal lavage by paracentesis was performed on 152 patients with gastric cancer. The peritoneal lavaged fluid was subjected to RT-PCR analysis with primers specific for MMP-7 and conventional cytological Papanicolaou examination. RESULTS: The MMP-7 RT-PCR assay was able to detect cancer cells at densities even lower than 10 cells/sample. There was no signal of MMP-7 mRNA from mesothelial cells, fibroblasts, peripheral blood, and lavaged fluid from patients with benign disease. Cytological examination and MMP-7 RT-PCR assay results were positive for 27 (18%) and 28 (18%) samples, respectively. The sensitivity for the prediction of peritoneal dissemination by cytology and MMP-7 RT-PCR assay were 46% and 33%, but the combination analysis using both parameters improved the sensitivity rate with 62%. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the cytological examination and MMP-7 RT-PCR assay are independent predictors of peritoneal dissemination. CONCLUSION: The combination of cytological examination and RT-PCR assay of preoperative peritoneal lavaged fluid is a highly efficient and reliable method for the selection of patients for adjuvant i.p. chemotherapy.

3429732|t|Comodulation masking release (CMR): effects of signal frequency, flanking-band frequency, masker bandwidth, flanking-band level, and monotic versus dichotic presentation of the flanking band.
3429732|a|In experiment I, thresholds for 400-ms sinusoidal signals were measured in the presence of a continuous 25-Hz-wide noise centered at signal frequencies (fs) ranging from 250 to 8000 Hz in 1-oct steps. The masker was presented either alone or together with a second continuous 25-Hz-wide band of noise (the flanking band) whose envelope was either correlated with that of the on-frequency band or was uncorrelated; its center frequency ranged from 0.5 fs to 1.5 fs. The flanking band was presented either in the same ear (monotic condition) as the signal plus masker or in the opposite ear (dichotic condition). The on-frequency band and the flanking band each had an overall level of 67 dB SPL. The comodulation masking release, CMR (U-C), is defined as the difference between the thresholds for the uncorrelated and correlated conditions. The CMR (U-C) showed two components: a broadly tuned component, occurring at all signal frequencies and all flanking-band frequencies, and occurring for both monotic and dichotic conditions; and a component restricted to the monotic condition and to flanking-band frequencies close to fs. This sharply tuned component was small for low signal frequencies, increased markedly at 2000 and 4000 Hz, and decreased at 8000 Hz. Experiment II showed that the sharply tuned component of the CMR (U-C) was slightly reduced in magnitude when the level of the flanking band was 10 dB above that of the on-frequency band and was markedly reduced when the level was 10 dB below, whereas the broadly tuned component and the dichotic CMR (U-C) were only slightly affected. Experiment III showed that the sharply tuned component of the CMR (U-C) was markedly reduced when the bandwidths of the on-frequency and flanking bands were increased to 100 Hz, while the broadly tuned component and the dichotic CMR (U-C) decreased only slightly. The argument here is that the sharply tuned component of the monotic CMR (U-C) results from beating between the "carrier" frequencies of the two masker bands. This introduces periodic zeros in the masker envelope, which facilitate signal detection. The broadly tuned component, which is probably a "true" CMR, was only about 3 dB.

6329674|t|Paraquat: model for oxidant-initiated toxicity.
6329674|a|Paraquat, a quaternary ammonium bipyridyl herbicide, produces degenerative lesions in the lung after systemic administration to man and animals. The pulmonary toxicity of paraquat resembles in several ways the toxicity of several other lung toxins, including oxygen, nitrofurantoin and bleomycin. Although a definitive mechanism of toxicity of paraquat has not been delineated, a cyclic single electron reduction/oxidation of the parent molecule is a critical mechanistic event. The redox cycling of paraquat has two potentially important consequences relevant to the development of toxicity: generation of "activated oxygen" (e.g., superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical) which is highly reactive to cellular macromolecules; and/or oxidation of reducing equivalents (e.g., NADPH, reduced glutathione) necessary for normal cell function. Paraquat-induced pulmonary toxicity, therefore, is a potentially useful model for evaluation of oxidant mechanisms of toxicity. Furthermore, characterization of the consequences of intracellular redox cycling of xenobiotics will no doubt provide basic information regarding the role of this phenomena in the development of chemical toxicity.

8889395|t|How many gated lymphocytes are needed for accurate assessment of T-subset percentages by flow cytometry?
8889395|a|Current regulatory agencies specify the use of 2,500 gated lymphocytes for accurate lymphocyte immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. However, acquisition of 2,500 gated lymphocytes is often technically infeasible when testing whole blood from lymphopenic patients. Our laboratory thus compared CD3, CD4, and CD8 percentages obtained from a lymphocyte acquisition gate of 2,500 events with those obtained, respectively, from 1,000 and 500 event acquisition gates. The study group consisted of 59 specimens with CD4 values ranging from 1% to 66%; for data analysis purposes, the group was considered as a whole and was then subdivided according to CD4 percentage (> 25%, < 25%, < 5%). For all groupings analyzed, percentages of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocytes were not significantly different for either 1,000-event or 500-event gates when compared to the standard 2,500 gate (paired t-test). Replicate parallel analyses of some samples indicated that comparable precision is obtained by using the alternative gates. These findings indicate that the use of smaller numbers of acquired lymphocytes is a reasonable alternative in situations where 2,500 lymphocytes cannot be attained.

19122382|t|Effect of long-term streptozotocin-induced diabetes on coronary vasoconstriction in isolated perfused rat heart.
19122382|a|The primary goal of this study was to investigate the effect of long-term (9 months) streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes on the coronary vasoconstrictor responses to vasoactive agents such as high K(+), acetylcholine (ACh), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and the calcium-channel activator Bay K 8644. For this, we used isolated rat hearts perfused at constant flow rate. Each of the four agents caused dose-dependent increases in perfusion pressure in isolated hearts from age-matched control and STZ-induced diabetic rats. The dose-response curves for high K(+), ACh, and ET-1 were shifted to the left, so that at some lower doses of these agents the increased perfusion pressure was greater in coronary arteries obtained from diabetic rats than in those from control rats. On the other hand, the maximum contractile response induced by each of these agents was lower in the diabetic perfused heart. The Bay K 8644-induced contractile response was significantly greater in the coronary arteries of diabetic rats than in those of control rats. A threshold-constrictor concentration of Bay K 8644 (1 nM) potentiated the ACh-induced vasoconstriction in coronary arteries from both groups, and the potentiated responses were greater in diabetic rats than in controls at lower concentrations of ACh (100 nM and 1 microM). These findings suggest that the coronary artery contractile responses to lower concentrations of ACh or ET-1 are exaggerated in long-term STZ-induced diabetic hearts. These changes may be due to alterations in the activity of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels.

16255657|t|Alefacept: a safety profile.
16255657|a|Alefacept is a selective immunomodulating, antipsoriatic drug that blocks the LFA-3/CD2 interaction necessary for the activation and proliferation of memory effector T cells by binding to CD2 expressed on the T cell surface. Because the CD4+ count is reduced by alefacept, it is recommended that this count be monitored on a regular basis to ensure that it does not drop below 250 cells/mul. Few side effects have been related to the use of alefacept that differ from placebo even when CD4+ counts drop below 250 cells/microl. The side effects that have been reported are minor and include: headache, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, influenza, upper respiratory tract infections, pruritus, arthralgias, fatigue, nausea, accidental injury and increases in liver enzymes. Serious infections and malignancies do not appear linked to the use of alefacept. The percentage of patients who developed antibodies against alefacept is very low. Alefacept is a very safe biological therapy for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis with few side effects reported. The utility of checking CD4 counts while administering alefacept for 12 weeks appears minimal.

17190751|t|Primary progressive aphasia in a bilingual woman.
17190751|a|Multilingual aphasias are common because most people in the world know more than one language, but little is known of these syndromes except in patients who have had a stroke. We present a 76-year-old right-handed woman, fluent in English and Chinese, who developed anomia at age 70 and then progressed to aphasia. Functional neuroimaging disclosed mild left temporoparietal hypometabolism. Neurolinguistic testing was performed in both English and Chinese, representing a unique contribution to the literature. Results revealed conduction-like aphasia that was comparable in the two languages, although English was slightly better preserved. Primary progressive aphasia has disrupted 2 languages in a similar manner, suggesting their close neuroanatomic relationship in this case.

15702416|t|Rearrangements of the telomeric region of mouse chromosome 11 in Pre-B ABL/MYC cells revealed by mBANDing, spectral karyotyping, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization with a subtelomeric probe.
15702416|a|Previous work has demonstrated that chromosome 11 is trisomic or shows a duplicated region encompassing the E1/E2 band of chromosome 11 in 90% of v-abl/myc-induced plasmacytomas (Wiener et al. 1995). In the present report, we have studied BALB/c PreB lymphocytes that were immortalized by v-abl and stably transfected with a conditional MycER vector (Mai et al. 1999). These cells, termed PreB ABL/MYC, showed changes in the E1/E2 bands of chromosome 11 that are similar to those reported previously for v-abl/myc-induced plasmacytomas. This was shown by the use of chromosome painting, SKY, FISH and mBAND. Our findings suggest that the Pre-B ABL/MYC cells may be used to analyse the genetic changes affecting chromosome 11 that are associated with v-abl/myc-dependent tumorigenesis in mouse B cells.

11850489|t|SIC, an intracerebral beta(+)-range-sensitive probe for radiopharmacology investigations in small laboratory animals: binding studies with (11)C-raclopride.
11850489|a|Our aim was to show the ability of a recently developed beta(+)-range-sensitive intracerebral probe (SIC) to measure, in vivo, the binding of radioligands in small animals. METHODS: The potential of the device for pharmacokinetic studies was evaluated by measurement of the dynamic striatal binding of (11)C-raclopride, a well-documented D(2) dopaminergic receptor ligand, in rat brain after intravenous injection of the labeled compound. The effects of preinjection of the unlabeled ligand (raclopride, 2 mg/kg intravenously) and of increasing the synaptic dopamine level (amphetamine treatment, 1 mg/kg intravenously) or of depleting synaptic dopamine (reserpine pretreatment, 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on in vivo (11)C-raclopride binding were monitored by SIC. RESULTS: The radioactivity curves measured as a function of time were reproducible and consistent with previous studies using PET imaging (ratio of striatum to cerebellum, 2.6 +/- 0.3 after 20 min). Further studies showed significant displacement of (11)C-raclopride by its stable analog. Finally, the device proved its capacity to accurately detect changes in (11)C-raclopride binding after a sudden (amphetamine) or a gradual (reserpine) modulation of endogenous dopamine levels. CONCLUSION: These results show that the new device can monitor binding of PET ligands in anesthetized rodents in vivo, with high temporal resolution.

16971596|t|Magnetic resonance imaging of the fetal brain and spine: an increasingly important tool in prenatal diagnosis, part 1.
16971596|a|Fetal MR imaging is an increasingly available technique used to evaluate the fetal brain and spine. This is made possible by recent advances in technology, such as rapid pulse sequences, parallel imaging and advances in coil design. This provides a unique opportunity to evaluate processes that cannot be approached by any other current imaging technique and affords a unique opportunity for studying in vivo brain development and early diagnosis of congenital abnormalities inadequately visualized or undetectable by prenatal sonography. This 2-part review summarizes some of the latest developments in MR imaging of the fetal brain and spine and its application to prenatal diagnosis. This first part discusses the utility, safety, and technical aspects of fetal MR imaging, the appearance of normal fetal brain development, and the role of fetal MR imaging in the evaluation of fetal ventriculomegaly. The second part focuses on additional clinical applications of fetal MR imaging, including suspected abnormalities of the corpus callosum, malformations of cortical development, and spine abnormalities.

16715612|t|Stress and undetected hyperglycemia in southern Indian coastal population affected by tsunami.
16715612|a|AIM: Natural calamities are known to result in higher stress conditions and also result in adverse health outcomes including development of non-communicable diseases. The impact of tsunami on mental stress and prevalence of hyperglycemic conditions was assessed in a population affected by the calamity in coastal populations of southern India. METHODS: Two populations similar in demography and physical characteristics, but, one affected by tsunami were selected for a comparative study. Subjects aged 20 years or above were randomly selected (control population n = 1176; tsunami population n = 1184). Details of stress were assessed using Harvard trauma questionnaire and scores were assigned. Glucose tolerance was assessed using 2h capillary blood glucose (75gms glucose load) and diagnosis was made using WHO criteria. RESULTS: Stress score was significantly higher in tsunami population. Although the total prevalence of diabetes was similar (control - 10.0 %; tsunami population - 10.5 %) prevalence of undetected diabetes (5.7 % vs. 3.8 %; Z = 9.54, P < 0.001) and impaired glucose tolerance (9.8 % vs. 8.3 %; Z = 12.83, P < 0.001) higher in the tsunami area. Stress score was higher in women and in the young in the tsunami area. CONCLUSION: Population affected by tsunami was under high stress and also showed a high prevalence of undetected diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance.

16781097|t|A comparison of dehydration effects of V2-antagonist (OPC-31260) on the inner ear between systemic and round window applications.
16781097|a|V2-antagonist (OPC-31260 (OPC)) application to the scala tympani reduced endolymphatic hydrops. In the present study, we investigated whether systemic administration or local infusion via the round window (RW application) of OPC would be more suitable for clinical use. In Experiment 1, the increase ratios of the cross-sectional area of the scala media of experimentally induced endolymphatic hydrops were quantitatively assessed among four groups of non-OPC application, RW application of xanthan gum, systemic application of OPC and RW application of OPC. In Experiment 2, the effects of systemic and RW applications of OPC on plasma vasopressin (p-VP) concentrations and plasma osmolality (p-OSM) were investigated. In Experiment 3, endocochlear DC potential (EP) was measured in guinea pigs with the RW application of OPC. Electron microscopic observations of the stria vascularis and the hair cells were also made. Both systemic and RW applications of OPC significantly reduced endolymphatic hydrops. However, systemic application resulted in the distension of the Reissner's membrane in the non-operated ear, which seemed to be caused by elevated p-VP levels resulting from the systemic application of OPC. In contrast, RW application of OPC produced no apparent toxic effects in the inner ear, as indicated electrophysiological or morphological changes. Thus, drug delivery via the round window is more useful for the clinical application of OPC for medical decompression.

2809323|a|A case of a 13 year-old girl with abdominal aortic obstruction is presented. At the age of nine years she underwent an evaluation for a continuous murmur heard over the left costal margin. The blood pressure was 210/125 mmHg in the ascending aorta, and an aortography revealed a critical stenosis in the descending aorta proximal to the origin of the celiac artery. No surgical treatment was recommended at this time. At the age of 13 years she developed severe headache and was admitted for the second time. Upon catheterization the ascending aortic pressure was 242/150 mmHg, and an aortography revealed total obstruction of the abdominal aorta in the segment proximal to the celiac artery. An extraanatomical bypass was constructed between the right axillary artery and the right common iliac iliac artery with a 10 mm dacron graft. Two weeks after this procedure, the blood systolic pressure was 110 mmHg in the upper extremities. It has been 12 months since the patient had this procedure, and she continue to do well, i.e., she has no particular limitations of the hip joint movement, has no headache, and remains to be normotensive.

6611700|t|The effects of lactation and ambient temperature on the body temperature of female Norway rats.
6611700|a|Norway rat dams were placed in an ambient temperature of 4 degrees C, 22 degrees C, or 28 degrees C. Body temperatures were recorded over a two hour period on three days; each female was observed on Day 4 and Day 10 of lactation and three days after lactation was stopped. Body temperatures were initially higher during lactation than after lactation had stopped. Dams were less able to maintain their body temperatures in the 28 degrees C ambience on Day 4 of lactation than after lactation, and on Day 10 of lactation, were even less able to maintain their body temperatures than on Day 4. During lactation, dams were able to maintain and even increase their body temperatures in the 4 degrees C ambience. The data support the hypothesis that the acute hyperthermia encountered by rat dams during contact with their litters may be due to a physical restriction on maternal heat loss.

19209468|t|Phytosterols as functional food ingredients: linkages to  cardiovascular disease and cancer.
19209468|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine experimental evidence that has examined association of phytosterols and the reduction of the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Phytosterols exist as naturally occurring plant sterols that are present in the nonsaponifiable fraction of plant oils. Phytosterols are plant components that have a chemical structure similar to cholesterol except for the addition of an extra methyl or ethyl group; however, phytosterol absorption in humans is considerably less than that of cholesterol. In fact, phytosterols reduce cholesterol absorption, although the exact mechanism is not known, and thus reduce circulating levels of cholesterol. The efficacy of phytosterols as cholesterol-lowering agents have been shown when incorporated into fat spreads as well as other food matrices. In addition, phytosterols have been combined with other beneficial dietary components including fish and olive oils, psyllium and beta-glucan to enhance their effect on risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Phytosterols appear not only to play an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular disease but also to exhibit anticancer properties. A side effect associated with the consumption of phytosterols is that they reduce the blood levels of carotenoid. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that compensation for this impact on serum carotenoid levels can occur either by increasing the intake of carotenoid-rich foods or by taking supplements containing these carotenoids. SUMMARY: Dietary phytosterols appear to play an important role in the regulation of serum cholesterol and to exhibit anticancer properties.

18004201|t|Gait parameters in children with motor disabilities using an electronic walkway system: assessment of reliability.
18004201|a|PURPOSE: The study was designed to determine the reliability of temporal-spatial gait parameters in children with motor disabilities in two conditions: bare foot and with shoes and orthoses. SUBJECTS:: Nineteen children (mean age of 6.8 years) with Gross Motor Functional Classification System levels I-III participated. METHODS: Participants walked over the GAITRite(R) Walkway System and gait velocity (cm/sec), cadence (steps/min), stance time (% gait cycle), stride length (cm), base width (cm), and cycle time (sec) were evaluated. RESULTS: The single and three-trial average relative reliability estimates of the intraclass correlation coefficients met the minimum reliability coefficient criteria of 0.80. CONCLUSION: This was an initial attempt to evaluate the reliability of an instrumented walkway system. Further study should include more participants and address age, functional limitations, diagnoses, and use of assistive devices.

Serum bilirubin was primarily bound to a protein fraction with a molecular weight of about 600 x 10(3) or more in NARs. About 39.2% +/- 12.5% of the serum bilirubin during infusion of bilirubin was bound to the same fraction in Gunn rats. Bilirubin was substantially taken up into the liver and excreted into the bile in NARs, suggesting the role of a high molecular protein, probably a lipoprotein, in its blood transport and the hepatic uptake process. In NARs, biliary bilirubin secretion reached the peak between 20 and 40 minutes after the initiation of bilirubin loading and decreased thereafter, whereas it continued to increase in SD rats and in NARs to which albumin was administered 20 minutes after the start of bilirubin loading. Biliary bilirubin fractions before bilirubin loading were similar in SD rats and NARs, whereas an increase in bilirubin monoglucuronide (BMG) and a decrease in bilirubin diglucuronide (BDG) were observed in Gunn rats. After the initiation of bilirubin loading, a decrease in biliary BDG and an increase in BMG and unconjugated bilirubin were observed in all groups of rats.

16700648|t|Mechanisms of calcium signaling and function in lymphocytes.
16700648|a|The multifunctional role for calcium during lymphocyte activation and differentiation is well established; yet how fate-specific changes in calcium concentration are produced, and how these signals are translated into distinct cellular responses, is not known. A critical role has been identified for store-operated calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels; however, the lack of information concerning the structure and mechanism of store-dependent activation has limited our ability to define CRAC's role in the range of calcium-dependent responses of lymphocytes. Moreover, additional calcium-permeant cation channels have been recently identified in lymphocytes. These channels regulate functions distinct from those attributed to CRAC channels. Consequently, this review summarizes well-established mechanisms of calcium signaling and also considers recent findings which suggest that diverse and interacting pathways encode functionally specific calcium signals in lymphocytes. Speculation is also offered about how distinct patterns of calcium signaling are translated into diverse transcriptional responses.

3734934|t|Biochemistry and antigenicity of osteoarthritic and rheumatoid cartilage.
3734934|a|The purpose of this study was to test whether cartilage serves as the source or repository of antigenic components active in the stimulation of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis through an analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation. Articular cartilage samples were obtained from patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis undergoing joint replacement surgery. Each sample was homogenized and characterized biochemically with respect to the content of proteoglycan, collagen, and immunoglobulin. Proteoglycan content of rheumatoid cartilage was reduced by 71% when compared to osteoarthritic cartilage; the proteoglycan content of ankylosing spondylitis cartilage was reduced by 40% when compared to osteoarthritic cartilage. Immunoglobulins were detectable in all cartilage samples when analyzed by ELISA or end-plate titration. Lymphocyte proliferation, quantified by uptake of 3H-thymidine, was unaltered by addition of cartilage fragments, low (saline) and high salt extracts (2.0 M CaCl2), or cartilage residues. Both autologous and heterologous lymphocytes were tested against the cartilage samples with no difference in reactivity. Purified bovine articular proteoglycans and Type II collagen were also inactive. Although tetanus toxoid and phytohemagglutinin were effective stimulants of proliferation, lymphocytes from arthritis patients were suppressed relative to those of normal individuals. Analysis of arthritic articular cartilage by these techniques failed to demonstrate the presence of antigen(s) stimulating proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes.

16275184|t|Impact of diabetes mellitus on angiographic and clinical outcomes in the drug-eluting stents era.
16275184|a|The effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on angiographic restenosis and clinical outcomes after implantation of drug-eluting stents (DESs) has not been investigated in real-world practice. This study consisted of 226 patients who had DM and 560 patients who did not who underwent DES implantation between February 2003 and December 2003. We retrospectively compared the incidence of 6-month angiographic restenosis and 9-month major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization, between patients with and without DM. The 6-month angiographic restenotic rate (10.1% vs 8.2%, p = 0.41) and late loss (0.41 +/- 0.63 vs 0.36 +/- 0.65, p = 0.31) were similar between patients with and without DM. In addition, incidences of MACEs (4.9% vs 4.8%, p = 1.00) and target lesion revascularization (4.4% vs 4.1%, p = 0.84) were similar. Patients who had insulin-dependent DM manifested higher prevalences of restenosis (25.0% vs 8.5%, p = 0.04) and MACEs (17.2% vs 3.1%, p = 0.01) compared with patients who had non-insulin-dependent DM. In conclusion, in this study of real-world patients who underwent DES implantation, patients who had DM had restenotic rates and clinical outcomes that were similar to those in patients who did not have DM.

6392802|a|About 2.5% of the patients, on whom splenectomy is done, die later from fulminant bacterial infection. This particular late sequelae usually occurs within 5 years after surgery, however, - especially in adults, - it has been observed also decades after splenectomy. Pneumococci have been identified as infectious agents in about 70% of the cases concerned. This syndrome is caused by deficient clearance of bacteria, which is due to reduced phagocytosis, decreased IgM-production, disturbances of the complement system and lack of tuftsin. Prevention of this syndrome may be achieved by using surgical procedures saving part of the spleen, by appropriate use of antibiotics and by vaccination against pneumococci.

3012555|t|Inhibition of replication and expression of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III in cultured cells by exogenous synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to viral RNA.
3012555|a|The possibility of using oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to viral RNA or proviral DNA to inhibit the replication of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) [the etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)] in cultured human cells was addressed by studying the association of 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides with mammalian cellular components. The results indicated that exogenous oligodeoxynucleotides at 20 microM became associated with the membrane/cytosol fractions of the cell in amounts approximating 1.5 microM. Oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to a region close to the tRNALys primer binding site on HTLV-III RNA and others complementary to HTLV-III mRNA donor or acceptor splice sites inhibited viral replication (assayed as reverse transcriptase) and gene expression (assayed as virus-encoded proteins p15 and p24) by as much as 95%. Use of control (random) oligodeoxynucleotides suggests that the antiviral effects were specific. Although these results pertain to HTLV-III-infected cells in tissue culture, rather than to AIDS patients, they nevertheless point to a therapeutic potential of the complementary oligodeoxynucleotide ("hybridization competition" or "hybridon") approach in the treatment of patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.

11932941|t|Axonopathy, tau abnormalities, and dyskinesia, but no neurofibrillary tangles in p25-transgenic mice.
11932941|a|Neurofibrillary tangles, one of the pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are composed of abnormally polymerized tau protein. The hyperphosphorylation of tau alters its normal cellular function and is thought to promote the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Growing evidence suggests that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) plays a role in tau phosphorylation, but the function of the enzyme in tangle formation remains uncertain. In AD, cdk5 is constitutively activated by p25, a highly stable, 25kD protein thought to be increased in the AD brain. To test the hypothesis that p25/cdk5 interactions promote neurofibrillary pathology, we created transgenic mouse lines that overexpress the human p25 protein specifically in neurons. Mice with high transgenic p25 expression have augmented cdk5 activity and develop severe hindlimb semiparalysis and mild forelimb dyskinesia beginning at approximately 3 months of age. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses showed widespread axonal degeneration with focal accumulation of tau in various regions of the brain and, to a lesser extent, the spinal cord. However, there was no evidence of neurofibrillary tangles in neuronal somata or axons, nor were paired helical filaments evident ultrastructurally. These studies confirm that p25 overexpression can lead to tau abnormalities and axonal degeneration in vivo but do not support the hypothesis that p25-related induction of cdk5 is a primary event in the genesis of neurofibrillary tangles.

6095152|t|Pharmacology of some synthetic tetrahydrocannabinols.
6095152|a|DMHP (1-hydroxy-3-1', 2'-dimethylheptyl-6,6,9-trimethyl 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6-dibenzopyran or in brief dimethyl heptyl pyran, EA 1476) is a synthetic analog of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC). Both DMHP and its acetate, DMHPA (EA 2233) produce varying degrees of physical and mental incapacitation. Both compounds elicit orthostatic hypotension at dose levels far below those required to produce mild mental incapacitation. Compared with delta 9-THC, DMHP has clearly more potent and prolonged hypotensive action, but much less psychological effect. The potencies of DMHP and DMHPA are more or less similar, but the acetate derivative is more stable against the degrading effects of light and air. Like DMHP, DMHPA consists of eight isomers which vary in their potency. Accordingly, depending on the proportion of the isomers, the racemic mixtures show variability in their potencies. The isomers 2 and 4 have been shown to be more potent than the other isomers.

169258|t|Isolation and characterization of cytidine diphosphate diglyceride from beef liver.
169258|a|Cytidine diphosphate diglyceride was isolated from beef liver by a combination of silicic acid column, DEAE-cellulose column, and this layer chromatography. The product (5.8 to 17.4 mumol/kg of liver) contained cytidine/phosphate/fatty acids in the molar proportions 1.05/2.0/2.05 (theoretical, 1.0/2.0/2.0) (average for three preparations). The liponucleotide was split quantitatively by a partially purified hydrolase from Escherichia coli, specific for CDP-diglyceride, (Raetz, C. R. H., Hirschberg, C. B., Dowhan, W., Wickner, W. T., and Kennedy, E. P. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 2245-2247) into phosphatidic acid and a water-soluble nucleotide that was chromatographically identical with CMP. No dCMP was located in these hydrolysates. The liver liponucleotide was more effective than a synthetic preparation of CDP-diglyceride in promoting the formation of phosphatidylinositol with guinea pig brain microsomes. The fatty acid composition of CDP-diglyceride was compared with metabolically related phospholipids from beef liver. The liponucleotide had a similar composition to phosphatidylinositol, characterized by a high level of stearate and with arachidonate as the major unsaturated fatty acid. The content of arachidonate in both lipids was significantly higher than that in phosphatidic acid. The profile of fatty acids of cardiolipin was quite unlike that of CDP-diglyceride. These findings suggest several alternatives for the metabolic origins of beef liver CDP-diglyceride: (a) CDP-diglyceride is formed from an atypical pool of phosphatidic acid, (b) the enzyme is selective for arachidonoyl-containing species of phosphatidic acid, (c) the liponucleotide may also be derived from phosphatidylinositol by the back-reaction of CDP-diglyceride: inositol phosphatidyltransferase.

3783395|t|Herpesvirus hominis (HVH) infection in women with preterm labor.
3783395|a|A possible etiologic relationship between maternal asymptomatic genital HVH infection and pre-term labor was discussed on the base of the results of the investigation performed in this study. Latent HVH infection was diagnosed by the test of microneutralization. Asymptomatic HVH vaginal and cervical shedding was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence and cytologically. The incidence of latent HVH type 2 infection was higher in women with previous pre-term labor than in the control group. The obtained difference appeared to be statistically significant. The comparison of HVH type 2 asymptomatic cervical infection of the examined and the control group shows that it lies on the boundary of statistical significance. It means that further research of the subject is needed including prospective virologic investigations with the aim of detecting active HVH infections at the time of pre-term labor. Concerning the increasing significance of genital HVH infections in our environment, it seems reasonable to aim diagnostic efforts at the determination of both latent and active HVH infections, in order to reduce the incidence of pre-term labor and the perinatal morbidity and mortality rates by use of the appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures.

12200259|t|Embryogenesis and development of Epimenia babai (Mollusca Neomeniomorpha).
12200259|a|Neomenioid aplacophorans (= Solenogastres) constitute one of the main lineages of molluscs. Developmental data of early embryogenesis and larval development of neomenioids are available for some species based on histological sections. I used other techniques to study the development of Epimenia babai Salvini-Plawen, 1997, and here I report new data on neomenioid development. The embryos of E. babai are lecithotrophic and cleavage is spiral, unequal, and holoblastic. Two polar lobes are formed, one at the first cleavage stage and one at the second cleavage stage. No evidence of external metameric iteration is visible through scanning electron microscopy or histology at any stage. A ciliated foot, a pedal pit, and aragonitic spicules develop from the definitive ectoderm. A spicule begins as a solid tip, continues to an open-ended hollow spicule, and finally becomes a closed-ended hollow spicule. The free-swimming trochophore larvae of E. babai have been considered unusual in lacking the characteristic neomenioid cellular test, an outer locomotory structure within which the entire definitive adult body develops. However, through the use of scanning electron and light microscopy, semithin sections, Hoechst nuclear staining, and programmed cell death staining to study the ontogeny and fate of the apical cells, I show that the entire pre-oral sphere (the apical cap) of the larvae is similar to the test of the other neomenioids. The results suggest that the test of the neomenioid larvae is an enlarged pre-oral sphere of a trochophore. The test morphologies of neomenioid larvae are compared to those of pericalymma larvae of protobranch bivalves, and the homology and evolution of molluscan larval tests is discussed.

10414742|t|Penile implant success in patients with corporal fibrosis using multiple incisions and minimal scar tissue excision.
10414742|a|OBJECTIVES: To establish the efficacy of "minimal scar tissue excision" in the treatment of penile fibrosis. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with extensive penile fibrosis who underwent placement of penile implant from October 1989 to April 1998 were evaluated by a chart review of the patient's follow-up data. Function of the implant was evaluated at follow-up visits. The follow-up ranged from 4 to 84 months (mean 23.7, median 22). All patients had undergone minimal scar tissue excision of the fibrous tissue in the penis. RESULTS: All patients underwent successful introduction of the penile implant, and in no patient was the procedure abandoned because of technical difficulty. Intraoperatively, 1 patient developed a tear in the crus. It was not recognized during the initial operation but was repaired at a subsequent date by Gore-Tex grafting. The Uniflate prosthesis of another patient failed 2 years after the initial surgery and was replaced with the Mentor alpha-1 implant. None of the patients developed infection. All the patients had a functioning implant at the time of last review. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal scar tissue excision is a safe and effective method in the management of extensive penile fibrosis.

19047519|t|Newly introduced genomic prophage islands are critical determinants of in vivo competitiveness in the Liverpool Epidemic Strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
19047519|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates have a highly conserved core genome representing up to 90% of the total genomic sequence with additional variable accessory genes, many of which are found in genomic islands or islets. The identification of the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES) in a children's cystic fibrosis (CF) unit in 1996 and its subsequent observation in several centers in the United Kingdom challenged the previous widespread assumption that CF patients acquire only unique strains of P. aeruginosa from the environment. To learn about the forces that shaped the development of this important epidemic strain, the genome of the earliest archived LES isolate, LESB58, was sequenced. The sequence revealed the presence of many large genomic islands, including five prophage clusters, one defective (pyocin) prophage cluster, and five non-phage islands. To determine the role of these clusters, an unbiased signature tagged mutagenesis study was performed, followed by selection in the chronic rat lung infection model. Forty-seven mutants were identified by sequencing, including mutants in several genes known to be involved in Pseudomonas infection. Furthermore, genes from four prophage clusters and one genomic island were identified and in direct competition studies with the parent isolate; four were demonstrated to strongly impact on competitiveness in the chronic rat lung infection model. This strongly indicates that enhanced in vivo competitiveness is a major driver for maintenance and diversifying selection of these genomic prophage genes.

18701890|t|Autophagy in thymic epithelium shapes the T-cell repertoire and is essential for tolerance.
18701890|a|Recognition of self-antigen-derived epitopes presented by major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules on thymic epithelial cells (TECs) is critical for the generation of a functional and self-tolerant CD4 T-cell repertoire. Whereas haematopoietic antigen-presenting cells generate MHC-II-peptide complexes predominantly through the processing of endocytosed polypeptides, it remains unknown if and how TECs use unconventional pathways of antigen presentation. Here we address the role of macroautophagy, a process that has recently been shown to allow for endogenous MHC II loading, in T-cell repertoire selection in the mouse thymus. In contrast to most other tissues, TECs had a high constitutive level of autophagy. Genetic interference with autophagy specifically in TECs led to altered selection of certain MHC-II-restricted T-cell specificities and resulted in severe colitis and multi-organ inflammation. Our findings indicate that autophagy focuses the MHC-II-peptide repertoire of TECs on their intracellular milieu, which notably comprises a wide array of otherwise strictly 'tissue-specific' self antigens. In doing so, it contributes to T-cell selection and is essential for the generation of a self-tolerant T-cell repertoire.

8660159|t|Twelfth-nerve palsy. Analysis of 100 cases.
8660159|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the causes and characteristics of hypoglossal nerve palsy. DESIGN: A review of 26 years of personal experience in a large public hospital. RESULTS: Twelfth-nerve palsies usually appear as signs rather than symptoms. Tumors, predominantly malignant, produced nearly half of the palsies (49 cases), while gunshot wounds made trauma (12) the second most common cause. Stroke (6), hysteria (6), multiple sclerosis (6), surgery (5), Guillain-Barre neuropathy (4), and infection (4) together accounted for about one third of the patients. CONCLUSION: Twelfth-nerve palsy proved to be an ominous sign, with only 15% of patients experiencing complete or nearly complete recovery.

17410573|t|Comparison of amorphous TCP nanoparticles to micron-sized alpha-TCP as starting materials for calcium phosphate cements.
17410573|a|The development of degradable bone cements with a mineral composition similar to natural bone was investigated using highly reactive calcium phosphate phases as starting materials. Mixtures of XRD-amorphous, glassy tricalcium phosphate (amorphous-TCP) nanoparticles of 25-60 nm size and micron sized, milled alpha-TCP were set by hydration with sodium phosphate buffer and investigated for possible application as single component calcium phosphate cements (CPCs). Isothermal calorimetry allowed a precise tracking of the setting process. Amorphous-TCP nanoparticles converted into calcium deficient hydroxyapatite with cement setting times below 12 min. The total energy release by the material during hardening corroborated the importance of high specific surface area and phase composition, that is, amorphous state of the nanometric starting material as repeatedly suggested earlier. The phase composition of the resulting CPCs was characterized by X-ray diffraction before and after setting. The morphology was investigated by nitrogen adsorption, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy and revealed the formation of highly porous calcium deficient hydroxyapatite with specific surface areas of up to 160 m(2) g(-1) after setting. In contrast to the very fast reaction time and highest specific surface area, the mechanical stability of the resulting CPC is still insufficient and requires further improvement.

7904244|t|Evidence that striatal synthesis-inhibiting autoreceptors are dopamine D3 receptors.

The KA values correlated significantly with the affinities (Ki) of the agonists for the D3 (r = 0.999, P < 0.05) but not the D2 (r = -0.13) receptor, suggesting that striatal synthesis-inhibiting autoreceptors are of the D3 rather than the D2 subtype.

17931791|t|Multifocal ischemic necroses of varying age (MINOVA): A distinctive form of atherosclerotic heart disease.
17931791|a|While reviewing the cardiac histopathology and the postmortem arteriography of patients studied at autopsy, a collection of findings was identified in a small proportion of those with ischemic heart disease. These included varying degrees of hypertrophy and left ventricular dilation and severe multifocal atherosclerotic obstruction of the coronary arteries by gross examination. Histology showed multiple small foci of coagulation or contraction-band necrosis in a circumferential, subendocardial pattern; focal replacement fibrosis of varying ages and size; focal atrophy or vacuolization (a marker of chronic ischemia) of surviving myocytes; and marked dilation of the subendocardial vasculature. This collection of findings described here is termed multifocal ischemic necroses of varying age (MINOVA). Review of patient histories showed that the clinical suspicion for the degree of ischemic heart disease did not correlate well with the severity of the pathological findings.

12750791|t|Comparative mapping of Phytophthora resistance loci in pepper germplasm: evidence for conserved resistance loci across Solanaceae and for a large genetic diversity.
12750791|a|Phytophthora capsici Leonian, known as the causal agent of the stem, collar and root rot, is one of the most serious problems limiting the pepper crop in many areas in the world. Genetic resistance to the parasite displays complex inheritance. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed in three intraspecific pepper populations, each involving an unrelated resistant accession. Resistance was evaluated by artificial inoculations of roots and stems, allowing the measurement of four components involved in different steps of the plant-pathogen interaction. The three genetic maps were aligned using common markers, which enabled the detection of QTLs involved in each resistance component and the comparison of resistance factors existing among the three resistant accessions. The major resistance factor was found to be common to the three populations. Another resistance factor was found conserved between two populations, the others being specific to a single cross. This comparison across intraspecific germplasm revealed a large variability for quantitative resistance loci to P. capsici. It also provided insights both into the allelic relationships between QTLs across pepper germplasm and for the comparative mapping of resistance factors across the Solanaceae.

11563974|t|RGS18 is a myeloerythroid lineage-specific regulator of G-protein-signalling molecule highly expressed in megakaryocytes.
11563974|a|Myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis are controlled by haematopoietic growth factors, including cytokines, and chemokines that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Regulators of G-protein signalling (RGSs) are a protein family that can act as GTPase-activating proteins for G(alphai)- and G(alphaq)-class proteins. We have identified a new member of the R4 subfamily of RGS proteins, RGS18. RGS18 contains clusters of hydrophobic and basic residues, which are characteristic of an amphipathic helix within its first 33 amino acids. RGS18 mRNA was most highly abundant in megakaryocytes, and was also detected specifically in haematopoietic progenitor and myeloerythroid lineage cells. RGS18 mRNA was not detected in cells of the lymphoid lineage. RGS18 was also highly expressed in mouse embryonic 15-day livers, livers being the principal organ for haematopoiesis at this stage of fetal development. RGS1, RGS2 and RGS16, other members of the R4 subfamily, were expressed in distinct progenitor and mature myeloerythroid and lymphoid lineage blood cells. RGS18 was shown to interact specifically with the G(alphai-3) subunit in membranes from K562 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of RGS18 inhibited mitogen-activated-protein kinase activation in HEK-293/chemokine receptor 2 cells treated with monocyte chemotactic protein-1. In yeast cells, RGS18 overexpression complemented a pheromone-sensitive phenotype caused by mutations in the endogeneous yeast RGS gene, SST2. These data demonstrated that RGS18 was expressed most highly in megakaryocytes, and can modulate GPCR pathways in both mammalian and yeast cells in vitro. Hence RGS18 might have an important role in the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation and chemotaxis.

9670756|a|According to new biotechnology natural gamma-IFNs of swine and cattle as well as of laboratory animals (rabbits, rats, mice) were obtained. By trials in vitro and in vivo the preparations of swine and cattle gamma-IFNs have been tested. It was shown, that in vitro and in vivo functional activity of phagocytes (monocytes and neutrophils) sharply increased. There were increased phagocytic number, phagocytic index, bactericidal action, including functional reserve, the difference between spontaneous and stimulated by Staphylococcus antigen levels of bactericidity. Additional treatment by gamma-IFNs of animals after immunization by colibacteriosis vaccine increased antibody genesis 3-8 times in comparison with the control, but these titers were more stable during two months after revaccination. Besides antiviral activity, preparations of these gamma-IFNs had antibactericidal and antitoxic action of wide spectrum of specificity. The studied preparations are perspective means at usage in infectious pathology of animals, leukoses, immunodeficiencies.

3394331|t|[Preventive use of antibacterials with a single administration of 1 g ceftriaxone in gynecology and obstetrics]
3394331|a|An indication for prophylaxis in vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy is given in the case of high postoperative infection morbidity. In order to reach an adequate level of antibacterial activity in serum and tissue one should apply the initial dose before the operation. The presence of various risk factors in Caesarean section is also an indication for prophylaxis. This applies especially to emergency Caesarean sections which have an increased infection rate. The application of the substance should follow the separation of the child from the mother after cutting the umbilical cord in order to prevent a diaplacental diffusion of the substance which can lead to a false diagnosis of the newborn. Our clinical studies demonstrated that an infection prophylaxis in gynaecological obstetrical standard operations is very effective with a single application of 1 g Ceftriaxone. Only 1 from 90 patients developed a postoperative infection. There were only 2 patients with side effects, which were diarrhoea and an allergical reaction. The hematological, hepatical and nephrological function tests did not indicate any alteration of values related to the test substance. Finally we have observed that Ceftriaxone has not only proven to be highly effective in a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in extensive gynaccological and obstertrical operations, but also a compatible medicament in view of the rare occurrence of side effects. The clinical application of this medicament in gynaecology and obstetrics can therefore be recommended.

2885637|t|Adjuvant tamoxifen in the management of operable breast cancer: the Scottish Trial. Report from the Breast Cancer Trials Committee, Scottish Cancer Trials Office (MRC), Edinburgh.
2885637|a|In a trial that began in 1978, 1312 evaluable patients under 80 years of age who either had negative axillary nodes or were postmenopausal with positive axillary nodes were randomised to receive adjuvant tamoxifen 20 mg daily for 5 years, or tamoxifen for the treatment of first relapse. Estimates of oestrogen receptor (ER) content of primary tumour specimens were made in 57%. There has been a highly significant delay in relapse in the adjuvant arm of the trial. This benefit supersedes that from tamoxifen given as treatment for recurrent disease in control-arm patients (93% received this) so that benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen was maintained in the overall survival comparisons. This improvement seems to be independent of nodal and menopausal status. It does not differ significantly with ER level, although the greatest benefit in disease-free survival is in patients with levels of 100 fmol/mg protein or more.

15566031|t|Concurrent summer influenza and pertussis outbreaks in a nursing home in Sydney, Australia.
15566031|a|OBJECTIVE: To report on the investigation of a summer outbreak of acute respiratory illness among residents of a Sydney nursing home. DESIGN: An epidemiologic and microbiological investigation of the resident cohort at the time of the outbreak and medical record review 5 months later. SETTING: A nursing home located in Sydney, Australia, during February to July 1999. PATIENTS: The cohort of residents present in the nursing home at the time of the outbreak. INTERVENTIONS: Public health interventions included recommendations regarding hygiene, cohorting of residents and staff, closure to further admissions, and prompt reporting of illness; and virologic and serologic studies of residents. RESULTS: Of the 69 residents (mean age, 85.1 years), 35 fulfilled the case definition of acute respiratory illness. Influenza A infection was confirmed in 19 residents, and phylogenetic analysis of the resulting isolate, designated H3N2 A/Sydney/203/99, showed that it differed from strains isolated in eastern Australia during the same period. Serologic evidence of Bordetella infection was also found in 10 residents; however, stratified epidemiologic analysis pointed to influenza A as the cause of illness. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation revealed an unusual summer outbreak of influenza A concurrent with subclinical pertussis infection. Surveillance of acute respiratory illness in nursing homes throughout the year, rather than solely during epidemic periods, in combination with appropriate public health laboratory support, would allow initiation of a timely public health response to outbreaks of acute respiratory illness in this setting.

3576157|a|Hemofiltration has been advocated for reduction of extravascular lung water (EVLW) in both clinical and experimental ARDS. The influence of hemofiltration on EVLW was studied retrospectively in 10 patients with this syndrome. After 2 to 38 hours' hemofiltration net fluid balance was -3640 +/- 3609 ml. EVLW remained almost unchanged (from 17.6 +/- 5.4 before to 15.6 +/- 4.1 ml/kg after hemofiltration). In 4 patients a reduction of over 15% in EVLW was achieved, whereas in the remaining 6 patients EVLW changed within a range of +/- 10%. However, hemofiltration caused a decrease in cardiac output and oxygen delivery, thereby adversely affecting its benefits on EVLW and gas exchange. In ARDS hemofiltration should be performed under careful hemodynamic monitoring and only in some of the patients an immediate reduction in EVLW can be achieved.

12885878|t|External TEA block of shaker K+ channels is coupled to the movement of K+ ions within the selectivity filter.
12885878|a|Recent molecular dynamic simulations and electrostatic calculations suggested that the external TEA binding site in K+ channels is outside the membrane electric field. However, it has been known for some time that external TEA block of Shaker K+ channels is voltage dependent. To reconcile these two results, we reexamined the voltage dependence of block of Shaker K+ channels by external TEA. We found that the voltage dependence of TEA block all but disappeared in solutions in which K+ ions were replaced by Rb+. These and other results with various concentrations of internal K+ and Rb+ ions suggest that the external TEA binding site is not within the membrane electric field and that the voltage dependence of TEA block in K+ solutions arises through a coupling with the movement of K+ ions through part of the membrane electric field. Our results suggest that external TEA block is coupled to two opposing voltage-dependent movements of K+ ions in the pore: (a) an inward shift of the average position of ions in the selectivity filter equivalent to a single ion moving approximately 37% into the pore from the external surface; and (b) a movement of internal K+ ions into a vestibule binding site located approximately 13% into the membrane electric field measured from the internal surface. The minimal voltage dependence of external TEA block in Rb+ solutions results from a minimal occupancy of the vestibule site by Rb+ ions and because the energy profile of the selectivity filter favors a more inward distribution of Rb+ occupancy.

11818826|t|Osseointegrated alloplastic ear reconstruction with the implant-carrying plate system in children.
11818826|a|Osseointegration biotechnology has revolutionized ear prosthetic retention, and the benefits of osseointegrated alloplastic ear reconstruction have been well documented. The aim of this study is to present the authors' clinical experience with the implant-carrying plate system (EPITEC System) in children. For 3.5 years, 14 microtia patients (13 boys and one girl, ages 6 to 16 years) were treated with osseointegrated prosthetic ear reconstruction. A total of 30 titanium implant posts of the system were used; one of the patients had bilateral defects. Implant posts were inserted into a three-dimensional carrier plate, which was fixed by means of screws to the mastoid. All patients were operated on using a one-stage procedure allowing 2 to 3 months for osseointegration, followed by fabrication of the ear prostheses. After follow-up, which varied from 6 to 42 months for each patient, all implants that could be monitored were found to be stable. A total of 21 implant posts remained free from potentially dangerous skin reactions. The soft tissues around five of the implant posts in three patients were hypertrophied. One patient was lost to follow-up. The results suggest that the implant-carrying plate system offers several advantages in children: (1) Location of the implants is independent of the recipient bone available; (2) no apparent submergence is evident; (3) additional anchoring is achieved by newly formed bone growing over and covering the connecting bars of the three-dimensional carrier plate, which is only 1 mm thick; and (4) osseointegration is highly successful. Because of the limited number of cases represented in this article, along with a rather limited observation period, this study is preliminary. For a final evaluation, a longer observation time is needed. Despite this, the authors believe that a one-stage procedure with the system in the mastoid process in children can be recommended.

3964378|t|The vitamin C status of formula-fed preterm infants.
3964378|a|Forty-two pairs of maternal and cord plasma vitamin C levels were determined after term, preterm, and multiple gestation pregnancies and 95 determinations of plasma ascorbate were performed on 36 premature infants who were fed a recommended infant formula throughout the first month of life. There were no significant changes of the cord or maternal ascorbate levels or of the cord/maternal ascorbate ratio between term, preterm, and multiple gestation cases. A significant negative correlation was found between the maternal ascorbate levels and the cord/maternal ascorbate ratio, supporting previous observations that high fetal blood levels of vitamin C are maintained even in cases where the maternal vitamin nutrition is poor. A rapid decline from cord levels was evident during the first week of life, followed by maintenance of relatively low plasma ascorbate levels, despite supplementation of recommended vitamin nutrition. Further monitoring of ascorbate levels in premature infants is suggested for better adjustment of the recommendations for vitamin C supplementation.

3100860|a|Increased blood sugar levels may influence the refractive power of the lens in juvenile diabetics, and can lead to the rare true diabetic cataract ("snow-storm cataract"). Surplus glucose induces accumulation of the sugar alcohol within the cells, thus generating disturbances of the osmotic balance and finally causing cataract.

Experiments with animals have shown that aldose reductase inhibitors can prevent the formation of such opacities with streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. Numerous aldose reductase inhibitors are now known, but we still have insufficient knowledge to determine whether systemic or local administration is preferable. The mechanisms reported here are not relevant with respect to the frequent occurrence of senile cataract in older diabetics, which has often been described.

1430584|t|Uncertain relevance of gastric colonization in the seriously ill.
1430584|a|We have studied the temporal relationship for the same micro-organisms between gastric colonization and both nasopharyngeal colonization and major clinical infections in 100 consecutive, long-stay, intensive care patients. 67% of patients developed positive gastric cultures, mainly with aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and C. albicans; 33% developed positive nasopharyngeal cultures with similar organisms, but in only 8% was the same organism previously cultured from the stomach; 48% of patients developed infections, mainly respiratory, but commonly with different organisms. The presence of a positive gastric culture was not associated with gastric pH, bleeding, severity of illness, or mortality. The results fail to confirm that an ascending migration of organisms from the stomach is.frequent or that there is a relationship between gastric colonization and clinical infections. Firm therapeutic recommendation in these areas may be premature.

2987963|a|We previously found that a form of Epstein-Barr virus with rearranged DNA induces replication of latent Epstein-Barr virus. We now have found that one of three fragments of this rearranged DNA, when cloned in recombinant plasmids and used to transfect cells, can activate expression of several polypeptides from a latent viral genome. The 33-kDa protein that is the product of the active fragment is likely to be responsible for disruption of latency.

18028395|t|Physicians' perceptions of adherence to prophylactic clotting factor infusions.
18028395|a|The objective of this study was to investigate whether paediatric Haemophilia Treatment Centre (HTC) physicians are concerned about poor adherence to prophylaxis and if such concerns decrease prescription of prophylaxis in patients with haemophilia. Fifty-nine HTC physicians completed a written survey based on self-report of individual practice. Fifty-one (86%) prescribed prophylaxis on a routine basis. Overall, 32 (54%) believed that 76-100% of the patients on prophylaxis infuse > or =80% of the recommended prophylaxis doses and 25 (42%) believed that 51-75% of the patients infuse > or =80% of the doses. Physicians utilize multi-modal methods to make this assessment. Forty-eight (81%) respondents identified that perceptions of patient non-adherence decrease their prescription of prophylaxis. In fact, 30% decided not to prescribe prophylaxis for individual patients within the last year secondary to concerns about non-adherence. Strategies should be developed to improve the implementation of prophylaxis.

3893528|t|Long-term ocular hypotensive effect of levobunolol: results of a one-year study.
3893528|a|Data for the first 12 months are reported for an ongoing, multicentre, clinical study comparing the long-term, ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of topical levobunolol (0.5% and 1%) and timolol (0.5%). This study was a double-masked trial testing 88 patients with chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. During the 12-month period drops were instilled twice daily into both eyes after a washout of prestudy ocular hypotensive medication. The effect of the three treatments in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) was similar. Mean IOP reductions over the 12 months averaged 7.2 mmHg for the 0.5% levobunolol group, 6.2 mmHg for the 1% levobunolol group, and 6.0 mmHg for the timolol group. Decreases in mean heart rate of up to 5 beats per minute were observed in the 0.5% levobunolol group, up to 8 beats per minute in the 1% levobunolol group, and up to 4 beats per minute in the timolol group. Several patients were removed from the study owing to side effects possibly related to levobunolol treatment.

16371343|t|Roles for Rho/ROCK and vinculin in parietal endoderm migration.
16371343|a|The first cell migration event in the mouse embryo is the movement of parietal endoderm cells from the surface of the inner cell mass facing the blastocoel cavity to line the inner surface of the trophectoderm. F9 embryoid bodies provide an in vitro model for this event. They have an inner core of undifferentiated stem cells surrounded by an outer visceral endoderm layer. When plated on a laminin coated substrate, visceral endoderm transitions to parietal endoderm and migrates onto the dish, away from the attached embryoid body. We now show that this outgrowth contains abundant focal complexes and focal adhesions, as well as lamellipodia and filopodia. Treatment with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 promotes a 2-fold increase in outgrowth, and a transition from focal adhesions and associated stress fibers, to focal complexes and a decrease in stress fibers. ROCK inhibition also leads to an increase in lamellipodia. Inhibition of RhoA by transfection of a vector encoding C3 transferase, direct administration of the C3 enzyme, or transfection of a vector encoding p190 Rho GTPase Activating Protein also promotes outgrowth and an apparent transition from focal adhesions to focal complexes. Parietal endoderm outgrowth generated using vinculin-deficient F9 stem cells migrates 2-fold further than wild type cultures, but this outgrowth retains the morphology of wild type parietal endoderm, including focal adhesions and stress fibers. Addition of Y-27632 to vinculin-null outgrowth cultures further stimulates migration an additional 2-fold, supporting the conclusion that Rho/ROCK and vinculin regulate parietal endoderm outgrowth by distinct pathways.

17478890|t|Intranasal NAP administration reduces accumulation of amyloid peptide and tau hyperphosphorylation in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease at early pathological stage.
17478890|a|Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide and hyperphosphorylation of tau in the brain are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Agents altering these pathological events might modify clinical disease progression. NAP (Asn-Ala-Pro-Val-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln) is an octapeptide that has shown neuroprotective effects in various in vitro and in vivo neurodegenerative models. Previous studies showed that NAP protected against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, inhibited Abeta aggregation, and, by binding to tubulin, prevented disruption of microtubules. In this study, we investigated the effect of NAP on Abeta and tau pathology using a transgenic mouse model that recapitulates both aspects of AD. We administered NAP intranasally (0.5 microg/mouse per day, daily from Monday through Friday) for 3 mo, starting from 9 mo of age, which is a prepathological stage in these mice. NAP treatment significantly lowered levels of Abeta 1-40 and 1-42 in brain. In addition, NAP significantly reduced levels of hyperphosphorylated tau. Of particular interest, hyperphosphorylation at the threonine 231 site was reduced; phosphorylation at this site influences microtubule binding. Our results indicate that NAP treatment of transgenic mice initiated at an early stage reduced both Abeta and tau pathology, suggesting that NAP might be a potential therapeutic agent for AD.

9129172|t|Tissue injury and repair as parallel and opposing responses to CCl4 hepatotoxicity: a novel dose-response.
9129172|a|Recent studies indicate that the rate and extent of tissue repair, elicited as an endogenous response to toxic insult, are critical determinants in the ultimate outcome of hepatic injury. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a dose-response relationship for CCl4 measuring liver injury and tissue repair as two simultaneous but opposing responses. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with a 40-fold dose range of CCl4 (0.1-4 ml/kg i.p.) in corn oil vehicle. Liver injury was assessed by serum enzyme elevations and histopathology, and tissue repair was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into hepatonuclear DNA and proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry over a time course of 0 to 96 h. Stimulation of cell division, evident even after a subtoxic dose of CCl4, increased in a dose-dependent manner until a threshold (2 ml/kg) was reached. Doses above this threshold yielded no further increase in tissue repair. Instead, tissue repair response was significantly delayed and diminished. Injury was markedly accelerated above the threshold indicating an unrestrained progression of injury. Although 4 ml CCl4/kg consistently caused 80% lethality by 48 h, tissue repair response in the 20% surviving rats was increased by about 5-fold, aptly demonstrating the critical role of tissue repair in overcoming injury and enabling these animals to survive. This study suggests that, in addition to the extent of tissue repair, the time of onset of tissue repair also determines the extent of hepatic injury and inter-individual differences in the magnitude of tissue repair may contribute significantly to inter-individual differences in susceptibility to toxic chemicals. Thus, while dose-related and prompt stimulation of tissue regeneration leads to recovery, delayed and attenuated repair response, occurring at higher doses, leads to progression of injury and animal mortality. Such dose-response relationships may lead to a better understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms of injury inflicted by chemical toxicants and aid in fine-tuning risk assessment.

7051367|t|A history of rhinoplasty.
7051367|a|The history of rhinoplasty, from the writings of Sushruta in 500 BC to the present, is discussed. The interest shown in plastic surgery was sporadic for several thousand years and punctuated by peaks of interest stimulated by the attainments of the Brancas and Tagliacozzi. A stagnant period of 200 years ended with the revival of the art as a result of a letter published in the Gentleman's Magazine of London in 1794. The influence that this description of a forehead flap reconstruction of the nose had on Joseph Carpue and European surgeons, and the effects it had in modern times, are noted. The introduction of cosmetic surgery by Roe, Weir and Jacques Joseph, and the enormous influence of the latter on modern concepts are outlined. The psychosocial aspects of rhinoplasty as it affects the patient and surgeon are discussed, and the challenges facing the discipline evaluated.

10655459|t|Adhesion of menstrual endometrium to extracellular matrix: the possible role of integrin alpha(6)beta(1) and laminin interaction.
10655459|a|Previous in-vitro studies have shown that the endometrium preferentially adheres to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the amnion and peritoneum. This interaction probably involves adhesion molecules, e.g. integrins. We evaluated the expression of integrins in naturally shed menstrual endometrium and the adhesion pattern of this tissue to different components of the ECM. To identify integrins and matrix components involved, blocking studies were performed. Most of the 15 menstrual tissue samples showed positive staining for each of the integrins investigated, except alpha(4)beta(1). Compared with binding to collagen IV, which was set at 100%, adhesion to collagen I was 93% (not significant), to fibronectin 87% (P < 0.05), and to laminin 74% (P < 0.05). Scanning electron micoscopy showed that endometrium adhered to laminin but hardly spread, whereas spreading was observed when layered on the other coatings. Compared with the control (which was set at 100%), incubation with 4B4, a monoclonal antibody against the integrin beta(1) subunit, showed a significant reduction of adhesion (to approximately 50%; P < 0.05) when layered on laminin and a smaller reduction (to 82-86%; P < 0.05) when layered on the other three coatings. Incubation with antibody GOH3 against integrin alpha(6)beta(1) resulted in a similar reduction in adhesion to laminin. Incubation with an RGD peptide significantly reduced adhesion (to 84%; P < 0.05) when plated on fibronectin. In conclusion, antegradely shed menstrual endometrium expresses various integrins. It shows preferential attachment to collagen IV and collagen I, when compared with fibronectin and laminin. Blockage of the integrin beta(1) subunit resulted in greatest disruption to adhesion when layered on laminin, implying that the interaction was mediated by the alpha(6)beta(1) integrin. Since this adhesion was not completely blocked, other mechanisms are likely to be involved.

2024080|t|[A case of beriberi heart--with special reference to the rapid effect of fursultiamine on hemodynamics]
2024080|a|A 33-year-old man was admitted to Kushiro City General Hospital on February 27, 1989, because of palpitation, shortness of breath and anasarca. Eight months previously he had noted the onset of pretibial edema, which had progressed to anasarca. He had had a meal only once a day for nine months. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 114/46 mmHg and pulse rate of 80/min. The 3rd sound was audible. No rales in the chest and no hepatosplenomegaly were noted. Ascites, pretibial edema and anasarca were present. Vibration sensation was diminished, and the deep tendon reflexes were absent in the legs. The blood thiamine level on the 4th day of hospitalization decreased to 2.9 micrograms/dl. The red cell transketolase activity and TPP effect on the 10th hospital day were 0.76 IU/gHb and 11%, respectively. A chest roentogenogram showed pulmonary congestion and cardiomegaly (CTR 61.3%). The electrocardiogram showed non-specific T wave changes. On the echocardiogram, remarkable pericardial effusion and diffuse hypertrophy of the left ventricular wall were observed. In addition, the left ventricular wall motion showed a hyperkinetic state. On the basis of these findings, the diagnosis of beriberi heart was made. The hemodynamic study performed on the 10th hospital day showed a remarkable high cardiac output (CO) of 10.7 l/min and an extremely reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR) of 352 dynes.sec.cm-5. 15 min after intravenous administration of Fursultiamine 100 mg, CO decreased to 7.24 l/min and TPR increased to 848 dynes.sec.cm-5. Following the administration of Fursultiamine 75 mg, po/day, his symptoms and abnormal findings of clinical examination data rapidly improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

2318832|t|Effect of methionine oxidation and deletion of amino-terminal residues on the conformation of parathyroid hormone. Circular dichroism studies.
2318832|a|Circular dichroism (CD) studies of parathyroid hormone (PTH), its oxidized forms, and some fragments of the hormone are described. The CD spectrum of native PTH (84 amino acids) and the active fragment, 1-34 PTH, suggests that most of the secondary structure resides in the amino-terminal segment of this hormone. Oxidation of the methionine residue at position 18 has a small impact on secondary structure, whereas oxidation of the methionine at position 8 produces substantial changes. Oxidation of both methionines produces secondary structure changes that are greater than the sum of those seen upon oxidation of the individual methionines. The CD spectrum for the 3-34 fragment of PTH is identical to that of the 1-34 fragment, and that of the 7-34 fragment is only slightly different. The spectra of the 13-34 and 19-34 fragments are markedly altered from that of the 1-34 peptide, and those of the 9-84 and 19-84 fragments of native PTH are significantly different from the intact hormone. Computer-assisted estimates of secondary structure content, and difference spectra, were utilized to evaluate the secondary structure content of the peptides. These results suggest that residues 6-12 are important in formation of helical secondary structure and that a reverse turn may be important for the folding of PTH into a conformation with high affinity for receptors. Residues 1 and 2 appear to make no contribution to the secondary structure and may be directly involved in activation of receptors.

3083240|t|Polymorphism in a kappa I primary (AL) amyloid protein (BAN).
3083240|a|In an attempt to understand the relationship of amino acid sequence to the formation of primary or multiple myeloma-related amyloid (AL amyloid), we have determined the complete amino acid sequence of amyloid protein BAN. This protein belongs to the kappa I immunoglobulin light chain subgroup and has a polypeptide chain length of 126 amino acids. It encompasses the entire variable region, the joining segment and the first tryptic peptide of the constant region. This protein has two unique features. First, the molecule is glycosylated. At position 61 the usual arginine residue has been replaced by an asparagine with the generation of the signal sequence Asn-Phe-Thr, to which a glucosamine-containing carbohydrate unit is attached. Secondly, the protein is not monoclonal but consists of two chains which have the same variable region but different J-segments. Comparison of the BAN sequence with other amyloid and nonamyloid kappa I proteins reveals a systematic difference between the two groups. In the amyloid proteins, several hydrophilic framework residues have been replaced by hydrophobic residues. These substitutions may provide the nucleation sites for self-aggregation and fibril formation.

16614524|t|Therapeutic factors of cognitive behavioral group treatment for social phobia.
16614524|a|This study investigated the therapeutic factors influencing the outcome of cognitive behavioral group treatment for social phobia and the most helpful therapeutic component. Fifty psychiatric outpatients who were diagnosed with social phobia according to the DSM-IV criteria were chosen as subjects. Patients were asked to complete the Yalom's Curative Factors Questionnaire and Therapeutic Components Evaluation Form at the end of their Cognitive Behavioral Group Treatment (CBGT). The patients who showed more improvement rated significantly higher in therapeutic factors such as "Interpersonal learning-output", "Guidance", "Universality", "Group cohesiveness" than the patients who showed less improvement. Among the four components of CBGT for social phobia, cognitive restructuring was rated as most helpful. These results suggest which therapeutic factors and components should be highlighted in CBGT for social phobia.

9435676|t|Regulation of adenylyl cyclase in polarized renal epithelial cells by G protein-coupled receptors.
9435676|a|We employed two guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors known to be targeted to opposite domains in renal epithelial cells to test the hypothesis that the polarized receptor expression of receptors regulates the activity of the receptor's effector molecule, adenylyl cyclase. We used LLC-PK1 cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding the alpha 2B-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2B-AR) or A1-adenosine receptor (A1-AdR). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis confirmed the basolateral and apical expression of alpha 2B-ARs and A1-AdRs, respectively. Adenylyl cyclase activity was assessed by measuring cAMP accumulation following the addition of forskolin (10 microM) in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine to apical or basolateral chambers of confluent monolayers. A five- to sixfold increase in cAMP accumulation occurred following apical (or basolateral) stimulation of LLC-PK1 cells expressing apical (or basolateral) receptors in comparison to forskolin stimulation of corresponding domains of untransfected cells. We conclude 1) adenylyl cyclase activity is present at or near the apical and basolateral domains of LLC-PK1 cells, and 2) factors that regulate the polarized expression of inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors may also regulate local adenylyl cyclase activity.

16407849|t|The carbonic anhydrase I locus contains a c-Myb target promoter and modulates differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells.
16407849|a|The Myb proto-oncogene encodes a transcription factor (c-Myb) that is essential for normal hematopoiesis and is thought to regulate hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation by regulating expression of specific target genes. We identify the mouse erythroid-specific carbonic anhydrase I promoter (CAIe) as a target of c-Myb activity and demonstrate that Myb activity is critical for carbonic anhydrase I (CAI) expression in C19 MEL cells. CAI expression is downregulated when MEL cells differentiate in response to MEnT or treatment with N, N-hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). Coexpression of GATA-1 with c-Myb results in synergistic activation of transcription from the CAIe promoter and both transcription factors interact with the CAIe promoter in vivo. We identify a novel 20 bp sequence in the CAIe promoter that is sufficient to mediate synergistic activation of the CAIe promoter by c-Myb and GATA-1. c-Myb and GATA-1 interact with this DNA sequence suggesting that c-Myb and GATA-1 may be contained in a complex that interacts with this region of the CAIe promoter. Forced expression of CAI delayed HMBA-induced differentiation of MEL cells and maintained them in a proliferating state. These data strongly suggest that CAI is a c-Myb target and is involved in regulating MEL cell proliferation and differentiation.

1825596|t|An observational study of isotretinoin recipients treated for acne in a health maintenance organization.
1825596|a|From September 1982 to June 1987, all members (N = 513) of the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, Seattle, Wash, who were prescribed isotretinoin for acne were observed throughout the first 4- to 5-month course of therapy for effectiveness and adverse effects. The highest rates of use were among male subjects aged 15 to 24 years. Excluding 47 subjects whose prescriptions were stopped because of noncompliance or who left the care of Group Health Cooperative physicians, 39 (8.4%) of the remaining 466 discontinued taking the drug because of the following adverse effects: mucous/skin/musculoskeletal effects (17); elevated triglyceride levels (eight); headaches (five); increased liver enzyme levels (three); amenorrhea (two); and other (four). One subject, excluded from the 466 because of noncompliance, became pregnant while using medication from a previous prescription and had a therapeutic abortion; she was not under the care of a physician at the time of pregnancy. Most subjects (97%) developed a mucocutaneous symptom, and 42% developed musculoskeletal symptoms. Moderate elevations in liver enzyme levels developed in six (1.8%) of 341 subjects with normal baseline values. Of 389 subjects with normal baseline triglyceride values (less than 2.25 mmol/L), nine (2.3%) developed moderate elevations (4.5 to 9.0 mmol/L), and one (0.3%) developed a severe elevation (greater than or equal to 9.0 mmol/L). Of 24 subjects with elevated baseline triglyceride levels, three (12.5%) developed moderate elevations. Of an additional 53 subjects whose baseline serum triglyceride levels were not determined, two developed elevations during therapy, one up to 13.4 mmol/L. Subjects who were overweight or had elevated baseline serum triglyceride values had an increased risk of developing elevations in triglyceride levels during therapy (odds ratio, 6.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 22.0; and odds ratio, 4.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 20.2, respectively). Acne was improved for at least 94.0% of subjects.

15343234|t|Clinical correlates of pain with amniocentesis.
15343234|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether sensory or affective dimensions of pain with genetic amniocentesis are associated with identifiable clinical correlates. STUDY DESIGN: Women completed the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire after second-trimester genetic amniocentesis. The effect of maternal weight, parity, previous amniocentesis, previous surgery, history of menstrual cramps, maternal anxiety, presence of fibroid tumors, and depth and location of needle insertion on pain intensity was determined. The T-test, correlation matrix, Kruskal-Wallis test, and multiple logistic regression were used for analysis; a probability value of <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one women were enrolled: 19.3% reported no pain, 42.9% described the pain as mild, 31.1% described the pain as discomforting, and 6.7% described the pain as distressing or horrible. Mean intensity of pain was 1.6+/-1.3 (on a scale of 0-7). Pain was most often described as sharp, cramping, fearful, and stabbing. Anxiety and pain were increased in women with an indication of abnormal serum screen as compared with women with advanced maternal age. Anxiety and a history of menstrual cramps were associated with increased affective dimensions of pain and had moderate correlation with quantified pain intensity. A history of previous amniocentesis and needle insertion in the lower one third of the uterus were associated with increased pain. Maternal weight, parity, previous surgery, fibroid tumors, and depth of needle insertion were not correlated with perceived pain. Presence or absence of an accompanying person was not associated with pain intensity. CONCLUSION: Women report mild pain or discomfort with genetic amniocentesis. Increased pain is associated with increased maternal anxiety, a history of menstrual cramps, a previous amniocentesis, and insertion of the needle in the lower uterus.

16751764|t|A cognitive signal for the proactive timing of action in macaque LIP.
16751764|a|Natural movements often occur without any immediate external event to cause them. In contrast to reactive movements, which are directly triggered by external cues, it is less clear how these proactive actions are initiated or when they will be made. We found that single neurons in the macaque's lateral intraparietal area (LIP) exhibit gradual firing rate elevations that reach a consistent value--which may correspond to a threshold--at the time of proactive, but not reactive, arm movements. This activity differs from sensory- and motor-related activity recorded in nearby cortical areas and could provide an internal trigger for action when abrupt external triggers in the visual input are unavailable.

2861408|t|Severe retinopathy and mild carbohydrate intolerance: possible role of insulin deficiency and elevated circulating growth hormone.
2861408|a|8 patients with severe progressive diabetic retinopathy despite continued mild carbohydrate intolerance on diet therapy alone were studied; each patient had presented initially with visual deterioration and none had experienced hyperglycaemic symptoms. By comparison with 8 carefully matched diet-treated diabetics without retinopathy, the retinopathy patients had increased circulating growth hormone levels and relative insulin deficiency. Several other factors of possible importance in the aetiology of microangiopathy, including circulating intermediary metabolites, platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and lipids were similar in the two groups. It is possible that hypoinsulinaemia together with growth hormone excess may contribute to the development of eye disease in these patients with otherwise mild diabetes.

8777777|t|Serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen: a potential marker for benign vulval disease?
8777777|a|Benign vulval disease comprises a variety of disorders and can affect women of all ages. To date, the optimal management of these conditions has been uncertain and not subjected to a systemic prospective approach. It is recognized that benign vulval disease has a potential premalignant potential. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) has shown in different studies to be an effective means of monitoring the course of the disease in cervical carcinoma. Elevated levels of SCCA have been found in the skin. In addition, raised SCCA levels have been found in non-carcinomatous inflammatory dermatoses, and the levels observed correlated with the extent of the disease and the response to therapy. It was thought that SCCA might prove to be a useful marker for benign vulval disease, and in our pilot study the objectives were to determine if levels of SCCA are elevated in patients with that disease and to assess whether there is an association between SCCA and clinical response to treatment.

2827043|t|A case of IgA nephropathy associated with adeno- and herpes simplex viruses.
2827043|a|We report here an adult case of IgA nephropathy associated with episodes of recurrent tonsillitis. Various kinds of viral antigens were examined in the renal and tonsillar tissues by immunofluorescence. Granular depositions of adeno- and herpes simplex viral antigens were detected in the glomerular mesangial areas and in the tonsillar epithelial cells by immunofluorescence. IgA and IgA1 deposits were also observed in the glomerular mesangial areas. It was suggested that IgA nephropathy might be caused by multiple antigenic substances, including adeno- and/or herpes simplex viruses, located in the tonsillar regions.

14503868|t|Mutagenesis study on the zebra fish SOX9 high-mobility group: comparison of sequence and non-sequence specific HMG domains.
14503868|a|A unique class of proteins, containing high-mobility group (HMG) domain(s), recognizes unusual DNA structures and/or bends specific to AT-rich linear double-stranded DNA. The DNA binding feature of these proteins is exhibited in the HMG domain(s). Although the sequence specific and non-sequence specific HMG domains exhibit very high degrees of sequence similarity, the reasons for the difference between their DNA recognition mechanisms are unclear. A series of zebra fish SOX9 HMG domain mutants was prepared in an effort to elucidate the importance of various residues on protein stability and DNA binding. This study is the first of a comprehensive mutagenesis study on a sequence specific HMG domain. Comparing how various residues influence sequence specific and non-sequence specific HMG domains helps us to rationalize their mode of action. Positively charged amino acids concentrated at the surface of sequence specific HMG domains recognize specific, linear AT-rich DNA segments. After the negative charges at the surface of the DNA are neutralized, the hydrophobic residues of the protein may intercalate DNA. Phenylalanine at position 12 plays a crucial role in the sequence specific HMG domain. The differences in pI values, the instability index, and DNA contact regions between sequence and non-sequence specific HMG domains are associated with their functional modes.

10234794|t|[Propofol sedation in endoscopic manometry of Oddi's sphincter]
10234794|a|Endoscopic manometry of the sphincter Oddi (SO) is a sophisticated method which requires a cooperative patient. Therefore, during endoscopic manometry sufficient i.v. sedation is crucial, and additionally must no affect SO-motility. In a pilot trial SO-motility was determined in ten patients with suspected SO-dysfunction (SOD) under initial sedation with 4.8 +/- 1 mg midazolam (baseline), and 3 min after an i.v. bolus of 50 mg of propofol. In addition, endoscopic manometry was performed in 57 consecutive patients with suspected SOD from 10/94-9/95 under sedation with midazolam (6.2 +/- 1.6 mg), and from 10/95-9/96 with propofol (268 +/- 111 mg). Sedation was always performed by an independent physician according to a standardized protocol. Neither the SO-baseline pressure nor the parameters of phasic SO-motility were significantly altered by propofol (including two patients with proven SOD). Propofol causes a more rapid onset of sedation, and the time interval to obtain successful biliary cannulation was shorter than under midazolam (p < 0.05). Successful manometric recordings could be obtained in 82% of the patients under midazolam but in 96% of the patients under propofol-sedation (p < 0.05), respectively. The patient cooperation was significantly better rated (by the endoscopist) in the propofol group than in the midazolam group (p < 0.01). The blood pressure and the heart rate were not significantly affected in both groups, however, propofol caused a significant decrease of the oxygen saturation (p < 0.05). Accordingly, an apnea episode had to be mastered by mask ventilation via ambu bag in one patient under propofol-sedation (uneventful recovery). In the midazolam group flumazenil-administration was necessary in four patients. The post-procedure recovery was faster after propofol--than after midazolam-sedation (p < 0.05). In conclusion, propofol is suitable for i.v. sedation during endoscopic manometry of the spincter of Oddi.

6334112|a|Retinopexy was performed by endodiathermy coagulation around a retinal tear provoked during dissection of epiretinal membranes. The dissection was a complement to vitrectomy for Candida albicans endophthalmia. The choice of this technique was dependent on the absence of need for the laser, and allowed an internal buffering to be carried out by the use of silicone oil. Angiography showed depigmented areas confirming the presence of scar tissue as seen in experimental rabbit studies. The scar involved the whole thickness of the retina and choroid adjacent to the cauterized pigmented epithelium. This method is simple and possesses the advantage of being able to be used when the perioperative laser beam is unable to cross the transparent media of the eye.

688374|t|Morphological changes in the esophageal epithelium of the eel, Anguilla japonica, during adaptation to seawater.
688374|a|The esophageal epithelium of the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica, was studied by light and electron microscopy. In freshwater-adapted eels, longitudinal folds of the mucosal surface are simple in form and lined by a stratified epithelium composed of mucous cells, filament- and ribosome-rich cells. Mucous cells are numerous. The filament-rich cells form the outermost and the basal layers of the stratified epithelium and are scattered in the middle zone among the mucous cells. They are firmly bound to one another by many desmosomes and prominent interdigitations of plasma membrane. The distal free surface of the filament-rich cell has a fingerprint-like pattern of microridges. A small number of columnar cells occur at the apices of the folds. They are rich in mitochondria and their distal surfaces bear short microvilli. In seawater-adapted eels, irregularly meandering folds increase the surface area of the mucosa. The stratified epithelium is extensively replaced by a simple columnar epithelium free of mucous cells. The columnar cells resemble in many respects those found in freshwater-adapted eels. They are rich in mitochondria and their distal free surface were provided with short microvilli. However, prominent lateral intercellular spaces and elaborate interdigitations of cytoplasmic processes in the distal zone distinguish the former from the latter. Results are considered in connection with the changes in ion and water permeability of the epithelium after seawater adaptation.

2115886|t|Sites of interaction in the complex between beta- and gamma-subunits of transducin.
2115886|a|Transducin, the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein in rod outer segments, is a heterotrimer consisting of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits. Activation of the photoreceptor, rhodopsin, by light, results in activation of transducin which cleaves to form transducin alpha. GTP and a complex of beta gamma-subunits. We have investigated the point(s) of contact between the subunits of transducin by analyzing for the formation of intersubunit disulfide bond(s) in the presence of copper phenanthroline. The formation of a new species with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa was observed which had resulted from the formation of a disulfide bond between the beta- and gamma-subunits. The amino acid residues participating in the disulfide bond were identified as Cys-25 in the beta-subunit and Cys-36 and/or Cys-37 in the gamma-subunit. Thus, these cysteine residues and, probably, some of the adjacent amino acid residues form a point of contact between the beta- and gamma-subunits of transducin in the stable complex.

12933681|t|Yellow fluorescent protein-tagged and cyan fluorescent protein-tagged imaging analysis of glucocorticoid receptor and importins in single living cells.
12933681|a|Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor after nuclear transport from the cytoplasm in the liganded state. Importins are docking proteins for karyopherin-mediated binding of substrate in a nuclear import pathway. To investigate the spatial and temporal relation between GR and importins, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of GR and importins in response to ligand in single living cells using fusion proteins labeled with different spectral variants of green fluorescent protein. Upon activation with ligand treatment, fluorescent protein-tagged (FP-) GR was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, showing a similar time course as FP-importin-alpha in the coexpressed cells with the fusion proteins. In contrast to FP-importin-alpha, the distribution of FP-importin-beta was little changed upon ligand treatment in the coexpressed cells with FP-GR and FP-importin-beta. Analysis using fluorescence resonance energy transfer proved that GR directly interacted with importin-alpha in the whole area of the cytoplasm upon ligand treatment and detached importin-alpha shortly after nuclear import. However, direct interaction between GR and importin-beta was not detected. These studies showed visual evidence of the nuclear importing of GR in association with importin-alpha in single living cells.

12574101|t|Mice lacking endothelial ACE: normal blood pressure with elevated angiotensin II.
12574101|a|Recently, the concept of local renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) capable of generating angiotensin II apart from the circulation has received considerable attention. To investigate this, we generated ACE 1/3 mice in which one allele of ACE is null and the second allele was engineered to express ACE on the surface of hepatocytes. ACE 1/3 mice express no endothelial ACE and lack ACE within the lungs. Their kidneys contain <7.8% the enzyme levels present in control mice. Plasma conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II was 43.3% normal. The baseline blood pressure and renal function of the ACE 1/3 mice were normal, probably as a function of a marked increase of both plasma angiotensin I and angiotensin II. When exposed to 2 weeks of a salt-free diet (a stress diet stimulating the RAS), blood pressure in ACE 1/3 mice decreased to 92.3+/-2.0 mm Hg, a level significantly lower than that of wild-type control mice. The ACE 1/3 mice demonstrate the plasticity of the RAS and show that significant compensation is required to maintain normal, basal blood pressure in a mouse with an impaired local vascular and renal RAS.

14757488|t|Cost-minimization analysis of treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Implications of varying holding time on conclusions.
14757488|a|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a common disorder. The most effective medical treatment for GERD is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The aim of this study was to specify the most inexpensive PPI therapy for GERD, and to examine the implications of varying outcome measure, holding time, on the conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of the treatments. Proton pump inhibitors that have holding time of intragastric pH>4 for at least 11h in 24h period (esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole and rabeprazole), were included. In this cost-minimization analysis (CMA), data on holding times were gathered from scientific publications listed in MEDLINE, prices of proton pump inhibitors from the Finnish database of drug prices and the treatment dosages were taken from the official guide of drug therapies in Finland. A decision tree was applied and the probabilities utilized were acquired from three expert physicians. The cost-minimization analysis was performed in three settings. At first, drugs that had a holding time (pH>4) of 11h or more were included. Secondly, drugs that had a holding time of 12h or more were included, and thirdly, a holding time of 13h or more was required. In the first analysis, the least expensive PPI treatment was lansoprazole (average cost of 138.89 per patient). In the second analysis, least expensive treatment was rabeprazole (193.81 per patient), and in the third, rabeprazole again (193.81 per patient). Esomeprazole and omeprazole were not among two of the least expensive alternatives in any of the settings. Which proton pump therapy turns out to be the least expensive for GERD, depends on the length of the holding time desired. Varying the holding time of the drug had a profound effect on the conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of the alternative treatments.

In all three stages of the study regeneration of plaque were observed in all individuals within 24 hours after thorough prophylaxis. 2. The tendency to plaque accumulation varied from person to person, from tooth to tooth in the same individual, and even on different surfaces of the same tooth. 3. The plaque scores and the range of plaque scores were lower on the first 2 days with the use of mouthwash when compared with tooth brushing on the corresponding days. 4. A reduction of 30.62% was observed with the use of mouthwash when it was compared with "no oral hygiene." 5. Plaque accumulation was 17.7% more with mouthwash than with use of the toothbrush. 6. A negligible reduction in efficacy (0.38%) was observed with this mouthwash in comparison with 1% H2O2, used under pressure.

3470810|t|Evoked release of acetylcholine from the growing embryonic neuron.
3470810|a|An excised patch of embryonic muscle membrane was used as a probe for measuring the release of acetylcholine (AcCho) from growing spinal neurons in Xenopus cell culture. The neuron was stimulated extracellularly at the soma, and the evoked AcCho release was monitored at the growth cone, along the neurite, and near the soma. For a majority of the neurons studied, a brief suprathreshold stimulation of the soma triggered a pulse of AcCho release from the growth cone. This release showed many of the characteristics reminiscent of the transmitter release at the nerve terminal of a mature neuromuscular synapse: it occurs within a few ms following the stimulation, depends on extracellular Ca2+ concentration, and exhibits depression and potentiation during and after high-frequency stimulation, respectively. Similar evoked release was also observed only at selected points along the neurite, and prolonged suprathreshold stimulus was required to induce release from the soma. These results indicate that some of the growing spinal neurons have acquired a substantial number of AcCho molecules as well as an efficient mechanism for excitation-secretion coupling at the growth cone, ready for establishing functional contact with the target muscle cell. This notion was further supported by the finding that the evoked AcCho release is capable of inducing suprathreshold excitation of the muscle cell within the first minute following neurite-muscle contact.

12649358|t|Increased relaxant action of forskolin and isoproterenol against muscarinic agonist-induced contractions in smooth muscle from M2 receptor knockout mice.
12649358|a|The ability of forskolin and isoproterenol to inhibit the contractile action of the muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine-M, was investigated in smooth muscle from wild-type and M(2) muscarinic receptor knockout mice. Forskolin (5.0 micro M) caused a significant reduction in the contractile activity of oxotremorine-M in ileum, trachea, and urinary bladder from both wild-type and M(2) muscarinic receptor knockout mice. This reduction in contractile activity was characterized by decreases in potency or maximal response, but not always both. Similar results were obtained with isoproterenol (1.0 micro M). The relaxant effects of forskolin in ileum, trachea, and urinary bladder from M(2) receptor knockout mice were approximately 3- to 9-fold greater than those observed in the same tissues from wild-type mice. Similar results were obtained with isoproterenol in ileum and urinary bladder, although the differences between wild-type and M(2) receptor knockout tissues were less than those observed with forskolin. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the relaxant effect of isoproterenol in trachea from wild-type and M(2) receptor knockout mice. In contrast to the results observed with oxotremorine-M as the contractile agent, forskolin and isoproterenol did not exhibit greater relaxant activity against KCl-induced contractions in M(2) receptor knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. These results suggest that a component of the contractile response to muscarinic agonists in smooth muscle involves an M(2) muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of the relaxant effects of agents that increase cAMP levels.

Recombinant factor VIII concentrates are available for the treatment of bleeding complications. However, inhibitors to factor VIII develop in 25% to 35% of patients with severe hemophilia A, making the management of bleeding episodes more complex.

16856845|t|cAMP phosphodiesterase-4A1 (PDE4A1) has provided the paradigm for the intracellular targeting of phosphodiesterases, a process that underpins compartmentalized cAMP signalling.
16856845|a|Specificity of cAMP signalling pathways has shown that the intracellular targeting of the individual components confers a three-dimensional context to the signalling paradigms in which they can exquisitely control the specificity of the outcome of the signal. Pivotal to this paradigm is degradation of cAMP by sequestered PDEs (phosphodiesterases). cAMP rapidly diffuses within cells and, without the action of spatially confined PDE populations, cAMP gradients could not be formed and shaped within cells so as to regulate targeted effector proteins. Of particular importance in regulating compartmentalized cAMP signalling are isoforms of the PDE4 family, which are individually defined by unique N-terminal regions. We have developed and pioneered the concept that a major function of this N-terminal region is to confer intracellular targeting of particular PDE4 isoforms on specific signalling complexes and intracellular locations. The paradigm for this concept developed from our original studies on the PDE4A1 (RD1) isoform. The N-terminal region unique to PDE4A1 consists of two well-defined helical regions separated by a mobile hinge region. Helix-2 provides the core membrane-insertion module, with helix-1 facilitating membrane association and fidelity of targeting in living cells. The irreversible, Ca(2+)-dependent insertion of the N-terminal region of PDE4A1 into membranes provides 'long-term' memory of cell activation.

7464200|t|Subclinical changes in brain morphology following cardiac operations as reflected by computed tomographic scans of the brain.
7464200|a|Effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and hypothermic circulatory arrest on brain morphology were evaluated by computed tomography (CT). Of 57 children undergoing cardiac operations, 45 (4.5 +/- 2.8 years of age) were operated upon with the use of CPB with high-flow, mildly hypothermic perfusions. Twenty-seven of them were perfused with bubble oxygenators and 18 with membrane oxygenators. In the bubble oxygenator group, all 14 with 20 mu filters in the arterial line showed no postoperative CT changes, whereas four of 13 (31%) with 40 mu filters or without filters showed decreases in brain mass on CT scans. Three of these four patients underwent perfusion for more than 80 minutes. There were no CT changes in the membrane oxygenator group. Twelve infants (10.4 +/- 4.5 months of age) were operated upon with the aid of deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest (core temperature below 20 degrees C). Ten of 12 who had circulatory arrest for less than 60 minutes showed no CT changes, but two infants who had circulatory arrest for more than 60 minutes showed changes similar to those described above. All six children with CT changes had no clinical manifestation of the brain damage, and their CT abnormalities recovered within 6 to 11 months after operation. The specific cause of these changes remains undetermined, but microemboli or hypoxia during operation could be implicated.

16549411|t|A diagnostic formulation for anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease.
16549411|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the earliest symptoms of anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease and to validate a criteria-guided strategy to diagnose anosognosia in dementia. METHODS: A consecutive series of 750 patients with very mild or probable Alzheimer's disease attending a memory clinic, as well as their respective care givers, was assessed using a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation. RESULTS: The factors of anosognosia for (1) basic activities of daily living (bADL), (2) instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), (3) depression and (4) disinhibition were produced by a principal component analysis on the differential scores (ie, caregiver score minus patient score) on the anosognosia questionnaire for dementia. A discrepancy of two or more points in the anosognosia-iADL factor was found to have a high sensitivity and specificity to identify clinically diagnosed anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease. By logistic regression analysis, the severity of dementia and apathy were both shown to be noticeably associated with anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: Anosognosia in those with Alzheimer's disease is manifested as poor awareness of deficits in iADL and bADL, depressive changes and behavioural disinhibition. The frequency of anosognosia is found to increase considerably with the severity of dementia. The validity of a specific set of criteria to diagnose anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease was shown, which may contribute to the early identification of this condition.

12827662|t|Improvement of the Kleihauer-Betke test by automated detection of fetal erythrocytes in maternal blood.
12827662|a|BACKGROUND: Reliable detection and quantification of fetal red cells in maternal blood is important in routine obstetric practice. The manual Kleihauer-Betke test (KBT) is widely used, but it is imprecise and subjective. This study investigated whether automated readout of the KBT could improve sensitivity and accuracy. METHODS: Glass slides containing dilutions of fetal red cells in adult blood were prepared and stained by using acid elution. Standard manual evaluation of the KBT was performed for all slides by one investigator. In addition, automated microscopy and image analysis of the same slides were performed, whereby detected fetal cells were reviewed by two independent investigators. RESULTS: Ten replicate measurements of fetal cell numbers showed high reproducibility and very small interobserver and intraobserver variabilities. Typical coefficients of variation were 3-4% for concentrations ranging from 0.001% to 0.1%. The automated KBT showed strong correlation between theoretical and detected concentrations of fetal cells (r2 = 0.999). In the range from 0.0001% to 0.001%, the standard KBT underestimated the fetal cell percentage, whereas the automated KBT was very precise. The correlation between methods was good (r2 = 0.999). CONCLUSION: Automated readout of the KBT improved accuracy of fetal cell detection in the range from 0.0001% to 1% fetomaternal hemorrhage, particularly when larger numbers of cells were analyzed.

1981012|t|Somatostatin analogues in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer.
1981012|a|Newly developed somatostatin analogues may be useful agents in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer. Potential mechanisms of antitumor action include suppression of circulating levels of trophic hormones and growth factors as well as direct effects at the tumor level, potentially involving autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. Pilot clinical trials conducted in heavily pretreated women with advanced breast cancer indicate that SMS 201-995 (Sandostatin R) has minimal toxicity and moderately suppresses stimulated growth hormone secretion and basal somatomedin-C level. Somatostatin analogues have also been found to retard the growth of experimental prostate cancer, particularly when used in combination with LHRH analogues. The therapeutic efficacy of these compounds used alone or in combination with other agents in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer remains to be established in larger clinical trials involving less heavily pretreated patients.

16925332|t|Comorbidity among the morbidly obese: a comparative study of 2002 U.S. hospital patient discharges.
16925332|a|BACKGROUND: Increased morbidity is associated with increasing severity of obesity. However, among morbidly obese patients, comorbid prevalence has been reported primarily in the bariatric surgical literature. This study compares demographic characteristics and selected comorbid conditions of morbidly obese patients discharged after surgical obesity procedures and morbidly obese patients discharged after all other hospital procedures. METHODS: The 2002 National Hospital Discharge Survey (a nationally representative sample of hospital discharge records) and the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification were used to identify and describe all morbidly obese patient discharges (n = 3,473) and to quantify the prevalence of selected obesity-related comorbid conditions. RESULTS: Compared with all other morbidly obese patients, the obesity surgery patients (n = 833) were younger (median, 42 vs 48 years; range, 17 to 67) and more female (82.3% vs. 63.7%), with higher rates of sleep apnea (24.0% vs. 11.8%), osteoarthritis (22.9% vs. 11.8%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (27.7% vs. 11.7%) (all P < .001). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was lower in the obesity surgery patients (16.1% vs. 24.3%; P = .003), whereas the rates of hypertension (45.9% vs. 41.0%; P = .13) and asthma (9.6% vs. 12.0%; P = .26) were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic characteristics and comorbid prevalence of morbidly obese patients discharged after obesity surgery are consistent with reports in the bariatric surgical literature. Obesity surgery patients had a higher prevalence of some comorbid conditions. Possible explanations for this include preferential diagnosis, differential diagnostic coding, or increased severity of morbid obesity. Advancing surgical and insurance guidelines for bariatric surgery will require clinical data that accurately describe and quantify the demographic distribution of obesity and the associated burden of disease.

7628061|t|Functional requirement of the two TNF receptors for induction of apoptosis in PC60 cells and the role of mitochondria in TNF-induced cytotoxicity.
7628061|a|The rat/mouse T-cell hybridoma PC60 was transfected either with hTNF-R55 cDNA, hTNF-R75 cDNA, or both. Receptor-specific stimulation was achieved using agonistic monoclonal antibodies or receptor-specific muteins of hTNF. Either hTNF-R55 or hTNF-R75 could mediate the activation of NF-kappa B and the induction of GM-CSF, IL-6, and IFN-gamma. But only in cells carrying both hTNF-R55 and hTNF-R75, was TNF able to induce apoptosis. This apoptosis could be inhibited almost completely by cotransfection with human bcl-2 cDNA. Functional cooperation was observed between liganded and unliganded receptors for the induction of apoptosis. In vitro protein kinase activity was detected only in TNF-R75 immunoprecipitates from cells in which the receptor was signaling. Direct evidence was obtained for reactive oxygen intermediates of mitochondrial origin responsible for TNF-induced cytotoxicity in L929 cells.

2426474|t|Carcinoembryonic antigen and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin as serum markers for advanced urothelial malignancies.
2426474|a|Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin were measured in 92 patients with advanced urothelial malignancies referred to us for chemotherapy. Elevations of carcinoembryonic antigen and/or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin occurred in 60 of the 92 patients (65 per cent). Minimal elevations (less than 50 per cent above the normal range) occurred in 25 patients (27 per cent), while 35 (38 per cent) had significant elevations (more than 50 per cent above the normal range). Of the latter patients carcinoembryonic antigen alone was elevated in 16 (17 per cent), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin alone in 13 (14 per cent) and both in 6 (6 per cent). Among the 24 patients with initially elevated levels whose markers were re-evaluated during therapy the marker levels correlated with disease course in all 15 whose elevations were more than 50 per cent and in 4 of 9 with minimal elevations. In patients with adenocarcinoma of the bladder the carcinoembryonic antigen level frequently was elevated (9 of 10). We conclude that serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin are significantly elevated (more than 50 per cent above the normal range) in 38 per cent of the patients with advanced urothelial malignancies and can be used as tumor markers, since they correlate with the clinical course of the patient and the response to therapy. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels usually are elevated in patients with bladder adenocarcinoma.

8451603|t|Improved electrophoretic method for the analysis of dystrophin in human muscle.
8451603|a|A new simplified electrophoretic and Western blotting technique for the study of dystrophin in muscle biopsy material is presented and compared with immune histochemistry. The method is based on separation of dystrophin in a linear SDS-PAGE pore gradient of 4-8% acrylamide in ultra-thin, horizontal gels on plastic film support followed by horizontal electrotransfer for Western blotting. The advantages of this procedure are short separation and transfer times at high field strength, high resolution, short staining procedures and small requirements of chemicals. Samples from the same gel can be cut and examined with different antibodies. Final results are obtained in one day. Examination of patients with various types of muscular dystrophies verified the essential absence of dystrophin in DMD patients, and showed considerable dystrophin heterogeneity in patients with BMD. A girl with severe symptoms of dystrophy revealed unexpected dystrophin abnormalities. The results also indicated that SDS-PAGE with Western blotting and immune histochemistry are complementary, diagnostic, and research instruments, and that the reactivity of commercial antibodies may differ in these two techniques.

12519338|t|Local administration of growth hormone enhances periimplant bone reaction in an osteoporotic rabbit model.
12519338|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether rhGH administered locally during the surgical placement of an implant, in the tibia of an osteoporotic rabbit model, would induce qualitative and quantitative differences in peri-implant bone reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight New Zealand rabbits were ovariectomized and fed with a low-calcium diet (with 0.07% of calcium) to induce osteoporosis. After 6 weeks, an experimental titanium sheet was inserted into the rabbit tibiae. The rabbits were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group was treated with 4 IU of rhGH added locally into the ostectomy as a lyophilized powder and the control group was left without any treatment. After 2 weeks, animals were sacrificed, tibial sections were prepared and bone-titanium interface was examined at light microscopy, using Masson, hematoxylin-eosin and Pichrosirius stains. Light microscopic morphometry and densitometry were used to comparatively quantitate bone reaction. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Local administration of rhGH during the surgical placement of titanium sheets on the tibiae of an osteoporotic rabbit model enhances periosteal and transcortical reaction and mineralization of osteoid 14 days later around titanium sheets, without increasing bone resorption.

15950249|t|Circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in the four-striped field mouse, Rhabdomys pumilio: a diurnal African rodent.
15950249|a|Although humans are diurnal in behaviour, animal models used for the study of circadian rhythms are mainly restricted to nocturnal rodents. This study focussed on the circadian behaviour of a rodent from South Africa that has a preference for daylight, the four-striped field mouse, Rhabdomys pumilio. In order to characterise the behavioural pattern of daily activity, locomotor rhythms were studied under different light regimes using an automated data recording system. Under conditions of natural daylight, which include dawn and dusk transitions, R. pumilio exhibited activity restricted to the daytime period. Activity was concentrated around morning and evening with a decrease during mid-day. A similar diurnal preference pattern of behaviour was recorded under a light-dark cycle of artificial illumination. Under conditions of constant darkness, the four-striped field mouse exhibited a free-running circadian rhythm of locomotor activity with activity concentrated during the subjective day. Free-running rhythms varied greatly between individuals, from slightly less to slightly more than 24 h (range = 23.10 to 24.80 h). Under conditions of constant light, the mice were more active during subjective day, but the free-running rhythm in all individuals was consistently longer than 24 h (range = 24.30 to 24.79 h).

Like other cell surface receptors, stimulation of a mast cell via the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) causes multiple biochemical events that ultimately result in cell activation and effector responses. Recently, our knowledge of how these events are ordered has increased. We now have identified some of the molecules involved, how they are organized into macromolecular complexes by FcepsilonRI stimulation, and the role of some of the constituents of these macromolecular signaling complexes in mast cell effector responses. In brief, we review the knowledge on macromolecular signaling complexes used by FcepsilonRI in mast cell activation and provide our view on the regulation of signal generation and its effect on mast cell activation.

15031675|t|Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin inhibits cell growth and cell cycle arrest via a prostaglandin E(2) independent pathway.
15031675|a|Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, a cyclic oligosaccharide known for its interaction with the plasma membrane induces several events in cells including cell growth and anti-tumor activity. In this study, we have investigated the possible role of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in cell growth arrest induced by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin in Raw264.7 macrophage cells. Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin inhibited cell growth and arrested the cell cycle, and this cell cycle arrest reduced the population of cells in the S phase, and concomitantly reduced cyclin A and D expressions. Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin in a dose- and time-dependent manner, also induced COX-2 expression, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) synthesis, and COX-2 promoter activity. Pretreatment of cells with NS398, a COX-2 specific inhibitor completely blocked PGE(2) synthesis induced by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, however inhibition on cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest was not effected, suggesting non-association of COX-2 in the cell cycle arrest. These results suggest that methyl-beta-cyclodextrin induced cell growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest in Raw264.7 cells may be mediated by cyclin A and D1 expression.

15197108|t|Stimulus-specific defect in the phagocytic pathways of annexin 1 null macrophages.
15197108|a|The role of the glucocorticoid-regulated protein annexin 1 during the process of phagocytosis has been studied using annexin 1 null peritoneal macrophages. Wild type and annexin 1 null macrophages were incubated with several distinct phagocytic targets. No differences were observed in rate or the maximal response with respect to IgG complexes or opsonised zymosan phagocytosis, as assessed by monitoring the production of reactive oxygen species. When annexin 1 null macrophages were incubated with non-opsonised zymosan particles, they exhibited impaired generation of reactive oxygen species, which was linked to a defect in binding of cells to the particles, as determined with fluorescent zymosan. This phenomenon was further confirmed by electron microscopy analysis, where annexin 1 null macrophages internalised fewer non-opsonised zymosan particles. Specific alterations in macrophage plasma membrane markers were observed in the annexin 1 null cells. Whereas no differences in dectin-1 and FcgammaR II/III expression were measured between the two genotypes, decreased membrane CD11b and F4/80 levels were measured selectively in macrophages lacking annexin 1. These cells also responded with an enhanced release of PGE(2) and COX-2 protein expression following addition of the soluble stimulants, LPS and heat-activated IgG. In conclusion, these results suggest that participation of endogenous annexin 1 during zymosan phagocytosis is critical and that this protein plays a tonic inhibitory role during macrophage activation.

14580727|t|Valuing freshwater salmon habitat on the west coast of Canada.
14580727|a|Changes in land use can potentially reduce the quality of fish habitat and affect the economic value of commercial and sport fisheries that rely on the affected stocks. Parks and protected areas that restrict land-use activities provide benefits, such as ecosystem services, in addition to recreation and preservation of wildlife. Placing values on these other benefits of protected areas poses a major challenge for land-use planning. In this paper, we present a framework for valuing benefits for fisheries from protecting areas from degradation, using the example of the Strait of Georgia coho salmon fishery in southern British Columbia, Canada. Our study improves upon previous methods used to value fish habitat in two major respects. First, we use a bioeconomic model of the coho fishery to derive estimates of value that are consistent with economic theory. Second, we estimate the value of changing the quality of fish habitat by using empirical analyses to link fish population dynamics with indices of land use in surrounding watersheds. In our example, we estimated that the value of protecting habitat ecosystem services is C$0.93 to C$2.63 per ha of drainage basin or about C$1322 to C$7010 per km of salmon stream length (C$1.00=US$0.71). Sensitivity analyses suggest that these values are relatively robust to different assumptions, and if anything, are likely to be minimum estimates. Thus, when comparing alternative uses of land, managers should consider ecosystem services from maintaining habitat for productive fish populations along with other benefits of protected areas.

19227183|t|[A case report of anesthesia for a child with Pompe's disease (glycogen storage disease type II)]
19227183|a|A case report of a child with Pompe's disease (glycogen storage disease type II), who underwent two general anesthetics, is presented. The progressive infiltration of heart and skeletal muscle with glycogen results in a severe form of cardiomyopathy and respiratory muscle weakness. Death usually occurs by 1 year of age from respiratory insufficiency or end-stage cardiomyopathy. Consequently, there are significant problems in the anesthetic management of these patients. The patient, a female child of 6 months presented signs of cardiac failure and took treatment with olprinone and diuretic. The initial surgical procedure was placement of a subcutaneous central venous catheter. Anesthesia was induced with ketamine and midazolam intravenously, and was maintained with nitrous oxide (50%) and intravenous ketamine. The dosage of the dopamine and olprinone was necessary to maintain circulation. For tracheotomy, the second procedure, anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane and dopamine. Recently a promising enzyme replacement therapy has resulted in improved clinical outcomes, and the number of anesthesia for infants of with Pompe's disease will increase in future.

3440119|t|Nonspecific interactions in dye binding to DNA. Influence of alcohols and amides.
3440119|a|The binding of a few drugs (ethidium bromide, propidium diiodide, proflavine and actinomycin D) to DNA has been investigated in aqueous solutions to which cosolvents of different polarity have been added. It is found that both alcohols (less polar than water) and amides (more polar) lower the binding constant according to a linear relationship between the intercalation free energy and cosolvent concentration. The main action of cosolvents cannot be described in terms of electrostatic effects, since they predict much smaller changes in the binding constant than those observed. It appears instead that relevant solvation effects are responsible for the binding strength of the different dyes to DNA. As a general result, it is found that solvation effects largely contribute to the intercalation free energy, thereby weakening the influence of nonspecific interactions at the intercalation site.

14719958|t|Mechanism of two-electron oxidation of deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate by a platinum(IV) complex.
14719958|a|Many transition metal complexes mediate DNA oxidation in the presence of oxidizing radiation, photosensitizers, or oxidants. The final DNA oxidation products vary depending on the nature of metal complexes and the structure of DNA. Here we propose a mechanism of oxidation of a nucleotide, deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate (dGMP) by trans-d,l-1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetrachloroplatinum (trans-Pt(d,l)(1,2-(NH(2))(2)C(6)H(10))Cl(4), [Pt(IV)Cl(4)(dach)]; dach = diaminocyclohexane) to produce 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate (8-oxo-dGMP) stoichiometrically. The reaction was studied by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), (1)H and (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The proposed mechanism involves Pt(IV) binding to N7 of dGMP followed by cyclization via nucleophilic attack of a phosphate oxygen at C8 of dGMP. The next step is an inner-sphere, two-electron transfer to produce a cyclic phosphodiester intermediate, 8-hydroxyguanosine cyclic 5',8-(hydrogen phosphate). This intermediate slowly converts to 8-oxo-dGMP by reacting with solvent H(2)O.

17768492|t|C-reactive protein as an indicator of low intensity inflammation in children and adolescents with and without obesity.
17768492|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine the levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in children/adolescents with and without obesity and their correlation with body mass index (BMI) and clinical and laboratory variables. METHODS: A cross-sectional study comparing two parallel groups, one a group of overweight or obese children/adolescents (obesity group, n = 131) and the other a control group of children/adolescents without obesity (control group, n = 114). High sensitivity nephelometry was used to determine hsCRP concentrations. RESULTS: The obesity group exhibited greater hsCRP concentrations than the control group (p < 0.0005). There were relationships between hsCRP and BMI (p < 0.0001) and hsCRP and triglycerides (p = 0.05). The relationship between hsCRP and triglycerides was attenuated by adjustment for BMI, losing its statistical significance (p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: The hsCRP concentrations increased as BMI increased. The majority of individuals who were not overweight exhibited hsCRP concentrations of less than 2 mg/L.

16465999|t|Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas has abnormal imaging characteristics: report of a case.
16465999|a|Thanks to the development of image diagnosis and the spread of screening by ultrasonography, an increasing number of cystic lesions of the pancreas are being recognized. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is relatively rare among the cystic tumors of the pancreas in Japan. Herein, we report a case of serous cystadenoma that was difficult to diagnose. The tumor was located in the head of the pancreas, and it was indicated hypovascularity by enhanced computed tomography. These images did not indicate serous cystadenoma. After operation, we diagnosed correctly from the immunohistochemical examination. Although serous cystadenoma was believed to be in benign tumors, it has recently been revealed that serous cystadenoma has malignant potential. Therefore, serous cystadenoma that is difficult to diagnose should be completely resected.

7552219|t|Afferent projections to the lateral and dorsomedial hypothalamus in a lizard, Gekko gecko.
7552219|a|Afferent projections to the lateral hypothalamic area and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus of the lizard Gekko gecko were studied after applications of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Large applications into the hypothalamus labeled several telencephalic populations not observed after smaller injections. These included the rostrolateral area of the dorsal cortex, a sheet of cells deep to the caudal pole of the lateral cortex, the external amygdala, and part of the dorsal ventricular ridge. Other populations were labeled in the diencephalon, including the supraoptic nucleus and nucleus ovalis; in the medulla the medial reticular area was labeled. Injections into the lateral hypothalamic area labeled neurons in the rostrolateral dorsal cortex, anterior, lateral, and dorsal septal nuclei, the striatoamygdalar area, nucleus accumbens, vertical limb of the diagonal band, nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, the interstitial, ventral anterior, and ventral posterior amygdalar nuclei, several hypothalamic nuclei, and the posteroventral thalamic nucleus. Labeled brainstem populations included the ventral tegmental area, torus semicircularis, parvocellular and ventral isthmal nuclei, superior raphe, and the solitary nucleus. Injections in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus labeled neurons in the rostral and caudolateral poles of the dorsal cortex, anterior septal nucleus, horizontal limb of the diagonal band, nucleus of the anterior commissure, several hypothalamic areas, the lateral habenula, the posteroventral thalamic nucleus, and cells scattered around the dorsolateral anterior thalamic nuclei. Labeled brainstem populations included the torus semicircularis, ventral tegmental area, superior raphe, parvocellular and ventral isthmal nuclei, and the lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus. The results of these studies are compared with findings in amphibians and mammals.

7311180|a|Functional hemispheric differences were investigated from the point of modes of information processing. The subject's task was to judge a set of stimulus letters same (all are identical) or different (one item differs from the rest). The set was consisted of letters of alphabet or Japanese character (Kana and Kanji), which number varied from two to five. The reaction time was recorded and plotted as a function of the number of letters in the set. When the task was name or upright matching of alphabet or Kana, RT was increased linearly for both hemispheres, suggesting serial processing. On the other hand, in the case of inverted matching of all stimuli and upright matching of Kanji, RT showed no increase as in parallel processing.

16406863|t|Tissue microarrays and their relevance to the urologist.
16406863|a|PURPOSE: We review important aspects of TMA methodology and discuss its wide range of clinical applications with particular emphasis on key clinical studies. We also provide an update on recent and projected uses of this technology to help the urologist improve care in oncology patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A directed MEDLINE literature review of TMAs was performed. Important publications that have shaped our understanding of TMAs were selected for review. They were augmented by manual searches and our personal bibliographic collections. RESULTS: The TMA is a high throughput molecular biology technique that can significantly accelerate the processing of a large number of tissue specimens with excellent quality, good reliability and the preservation of original tissue. TMA studies demonstrate their accuracy and reliability compared to those of standard histological techniques and correlate with clinicopathological information to determine disease progression and prediction of the clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This review represents an overview and update for the urologist on TMAs and their clinical applications in urological oncology. In the future it is anticipated that the outcomes of this method will be used to assist in the diagnosis, prognosis and development of novel therapies in individual patients.

1885364|t|Effect of colostral fat level on fat deposition and plasma metabolites in the newborn pig.
1885364|a|The effects of colostral fat level on fat deposition and plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, and free fatty acids (FFA) were determined in 28 newborn pigs during the first postnatal day. Soon after birth, pigs were allotted to four treatments groups. Group 1 was killed at birth. The remaining pigs were fed intragastrically sow colostrum that contained high (10.2%; HFC), normal (4.8%; NFC) or low (1.0%; LFC) levels of total fat at the rate of 15 to 18 g/kg birth weight at 65- to 70-min intervals. A total of 21 feedings was provided and pigs were killed 1 h after the last feeding. Body fat deposition increased linearly (P less than .01) with the amount of ingested fat by .32 (+/- .04) g per 1-g increase in fat intake. Fatty acid composition of the pigs changed toward that of the colostrum with increased fat in colostrum. More liver glycogen was lost (P less than .01) in pigs given LFC. Plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin were similar in pigs fed HFC and NFC. After the 11th feeding (14 h postnatal), LFC resulted in lower plasma glucose concentrations (P less than .05) than HFC or NFC. Plasma insulin concentrations also were lower in pigs fed LFC. Plasma FFA concentrations remained unchanged in pigs fed LFC but increased with both fat content in colostrum (P less than .05) and time (P less than .05) in the other two groups. Colostral fat plays a major role in the supply of energy and in glucose homeostasis in the neonatal pig.

16373298|t|Hospitalized Swedish children with hand and forearm injuries: a retrospective review.
16373298|a|AIM: To analyse incidences and find risk groups in children hospitalized with hand injuries in a national retrospective study. METHODS: All children with a primary hand or forearm injury admitted to Swedish hospitals during 1987-2001 were retrieved from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and analysed as to incidence and characteristics. RESULTS: Among 9855 children included, the median age was 7.0 y and two-thirds were boys. The incidence increased in both younger (0-6 y) and older (7-14 y) children. Wounds and fractures almost doubled, while muscle/tendon injuries decreased. In younger children, wounds and burns were the most frequent diagnoses. In older children, fractures and muscle/tendon injuries were common. Sharp objects caused most of the injuries. University hospitals treated almost half of the children. CONCLUSION: The number of children with hand injuries admitted to hospitals in Sweden increased annually. Analyses of causes behind the increase are important to counter this trend.

3603621|a|In the Kyasanur Forest disease area two species of wild monkeys, Presbytis entellus and Macaca radiata, succumb to the natural infection with Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) virus (family Flaviviridae). Between October 1964 and September 1973, 1046 monkeys (860 P. entellus and 186 M. radiata) died. Of these, KFD virus was isolated from 118 P. entellus and 13 M. radiata. Maximum mortality of monkeys was reported during December through May coinciding with the season of activity of immature stages of Haemaphysalis ticks, incriminated vectors of KFD. The epizootic showed an initial spread of the disease to the areas contiguous with the original focus of infection. This was followed by the recognition of epizootics and epidemics in three new foci, removed from the original focus, by the end of 1973. It was also observed that, in certain localities in the original focus, KFD virus activity persisted over several years.

15720362|t|Thirty-day mortality from colorectal cancer surgery within a deprived population.
15720362|a|OBJECTIVE: A recently published model for predicting 30-day mortality has been devised using data from 73 hospitals in the UK. Deprivation category was not one of the data sets used in predicting mortality and was not included in formulating this model. We wished to assess if the model was applicable to a population with high deprivation category scores. METHODS: Data on all colorectal cancer operations included in the model (age, ASA, cancer resected, Dukes stage and urgency) had been collected prospectively since January 1999. This data was applied to the model. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty patients were included in analysis. Overall predicted mortality was 8.2% and actual mortality 7.8%. Within different categories of deprivation, predicted and actual mortality are similar and not significantly different. 137 patients lived in areas of deprivation category 3-5. Predicted and actual mortality were 8.4% and 8.0%, respectively. In areas of deprivation category 6-7, 91 patients had a predicted and actual mortality of 8.0% and 7.7%. CONCLUSION: Although deprivation data was not included in the production of the mathematical model to predict postoperative death, the model appears to predict well in the deprived population. It is likely that poorer socio-economic status is accounted for by increased ASA and cancer stage.

While UV irradiation leads to a slow kinetics as observed by optical spectroscopy, the irradiation by the X-rays led to a reduction of the gold within a few minutes. The size and morphology evolution during the radiolytic formation of particles displays the initial nucleation phase and the growth kinetics, which exhibit very nonuniform behavior. They show that the electrostatics of the particle stabilization plays a pronounced role in the repulsive forces and transient clustering of particles.

8797635|t|Economic evaluations in the critical care literature: do they help us improve the efficiency of our unit?
8797635|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which economic evaluations published in the critical care literature provide information that can help us to improve the efficiency of our unit. DATA SOURCES: We searched computerized bibliographic databases and manually searched key critical care journals to retrieve all economic evaluations. STUDY SELECTION: We included economic evaluations that dealt with clinical problems relevant to the practice of adult critical care and that compared competing healthcare interventions. DATA ABSTRACTION: Included articles were further evaluated using criteria for minimal methodologic soundness, adopted from the literature, and criteria that we developed to assess the generalizability of results to our clinical setting. DATA SYNTHESIS: We screened 4,167 papers manually and > 450 abstracts and titles in our computer search. One hundred fifty-one papers were retrieved for further evaluation; 29 papers met our inclusion criteria. Of these 29 papers, only 14 (48%) adequately described competing healthcare interventions, 17 (59%) provided sufficient evidence of clinical efficacy, six (21%) identified, measured, and valuated costs appropriately, and three (10%) performed a sensitivity analysis. None of the papers met all four of these criteria for a minimum level of methodologic soundness. Four (14%) of 29 studies which adequately dealt with issues of cost and efficacy were evaluated using our generalizability criteria. Different costing methods precluded the application of the results of three of the four studies to our intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: In the critical care literature, very little useful economic information exists to help decision-makers maximize efficiency in their own setting.

9114446|t|Transcriptional expression of a putative tachykinin-like peptide receptor gene from stable fly.
9114446|a|STKR is a 4118 bp clone from a stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans, cDNA library which encodes a protein with significant amino acid identity to tachykinin-like peptide receptors. Ribonuclease protection assays and RT-PCR were utilized to examine the transcriptional expression of STKR from various life stages of the stable fly. STKR expression was detectable in all stages, but was most abundant in isolated adult fly gut and lowest in developing embryos.

2162177|t|[The effects of cold on facial nerve function]
2162177|a|Synonyms like "paralysie a frigore" and "rheumatic palsy" imply a dysfunction of the vasa nervorum during coldness application. Cooling the nerve, however, only reduces perfusion by 18%. Cooling of the facial nerve with pure ice to 0 degrees C leads to a functional loss due to a blockade of the temperature-controlled Na-K-channels. The vasomotor regulation of the nerve vessels under these conditions seems to be relatively unimportant.

2498621|t|Purification and characterization of streptococcal erythrogenic toxin type A produced by Streptococcus pyogenes strain NY-5 cultured in the synthetic medium NCTC-135. Comparison with the dialyzed medium (TP medium)-derived toxin.
2498621|a|Streptococcal erythrogenic toxin type A (ET-A) was purified from culture filtrate of Streptococcus pyogenes strain NY-5 grown in a chemically defined synthetic medium NCTC-135. We succeeded in simplifying the purification procedure, and obtained a highly purified preparation of ET-A. The purification procedure was the combination of ultrafiltration with Amicon PM-10 and YM-10 membranes, chromatofocusing with PBE-94 exchanger (pH 4.0-6.0), and gel filtration through Sephacryl S-200. The purified toxin protein showed a single band with Mr 28,000 on SDS-PAGE and had pI 5.2 on agarose IEF. HPLC chromatography pattern of the toxin revealed one symmetric peak. The result of amino acid analysis of the toxin was in accordance with that of Gerlach et al and with Weeks and Ferretti who reported the nucleotide sequence of the spe A gene. Biological activities of the purified toxin were remarkably potent. The mitogenic activity for rabbit lymphocytes and one skin test dose in rabbit were found at the lower dose of 10 pg and 1 ng of the toxin, respectively.

7707293|t|Expression of type VI collagen mRNAs in human endometrium during the menstrual cycle and first trimester of pregnancy.
7707293|a|The pattern of type VI collagen deposition in human endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle and in decidua of the first trimester of pregnancy was studied. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a dense microfibrillar network of collagen VI in the stroma of preimplantation endometrium which was reduced during the peri-implantation period and no longer detected in first trimester decidua. However, type VI collagen was consistently present within blood vessel walls in both endometrium and decidua. Using in situ hybridization, mRNAs encoding alpha 1(VI), alpha 2(VI) and alpha 3(VI) chains within endometrial stromal and vascular cells were identified. All three mRNA species are abundant in the villous mesenchyme of the first trimester placenta. The detection of collagen VI mRNA species in the endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle suggests that the apparent decrease in abundance of extracellular immunoreactive fibrils may be a consequence of translational control, matrix redistribution or turnover. In contrast, in the first trimester of pregnancy, collagen VI protein was mainly absent from the decidual stroma and amounts of mRNA were very low, indicating a significant reduction in production. Loss of stromal type VI collagen contributes to the remodelling of the maternal extracellular matrix of pregnancy.

8663474|t|The endothelial cell protein C receptor. Inhibition of activated protein C anticoagulant function without modulation of reaction with proteinase inhibitors.
8663474|a|A soluble form of the endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) was analyzed for the ability to modulate the functional properties of protein C and activated protein C (APC). In a plasma clotting system initiated with factor Xa, EPCR blocked the anticoagulant activity of APC in a dose-dependent fashion. EPCR had no influence on clotting in the absence of APC. Consistent with the plasma results, EPCR slowed the proteolytic inactivation of factor Va by slowing both of the key proteolytic cleavages in the heavy chain of factor Va. EPCR did not prevent protein C activation by the soluble thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, did not alter the inactivation of APC by alpha1-antitrypsin or protein C inhibitor, and did not influence the kinetics of peptide paranitroanilide substrate cleavage significantly. We conclude that EPCR binds to an exosite on APC that selectively modulates the enzyme specificity in a manner reminiscent of the influence of thrombomodulin on thrombin.

8001901|t|[The implantable cardioverter/defibrillator]
8001901|a|Despite all advances in the diagnosis and therapy of cardiovascular diseases, the mortality from malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias is still a major health problem. In addition to established therapeutic strategies in the prevention of sudden cardiac death such as antiarrhythmic drug treatment, catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drug treatment, cardioverter/defibrillator was introduced to clinical practice in 1980. The number of 50,000 overall implants reflects the current clinical status of the therapy with implantable cardioverter/defibrillators. Significant technical improvements in the defibrillator therapy may contribute to an increase in therapy acceptance. These advances include the introduction of nonthoracotomy lead systems, enhanced defibrillation efficacy, full programmable devices providing tiered electrical therapy, improved diagnostic Holter functions and enhanced arrhythmia detection algorithms. The major present goals of defibrillator therapy are detection and termination of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, prevention of sudden cardiac death, reduction in patient's mortality and improvement in quality of life. The efficacy and safety of defibrillator therapy to prevent sudden arrhythmic death has been proven in several large clinical investigations In patients with this device the annual sudden cardiac death mortality is < 2% even in high-risk patient populations. Compared to sudden cardiac death rate there is a much higher rate of overall cardiac mortality because a defibrillator is not able to prevent nonarrhythmic cardiovascular deaths. There is a clinical impression that cardiovascular mortality is lower in patients treated with an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator compared to patients treated with other therapies. However, there are no results from controlled studies providing scientific evidence that defribillator therapy can decrease overall cardiovascular mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

18446348|t|Swim pacemakers in box jellyfish are modulated by the visual input.
18446348|a|A major part of the cubozoan central nervous system is situated in the eye-bearing rhopalia. One of the neuronal output channels from the rhopalia carries a swim pacemaker signal, which has a one-to-one relation with the swim contractions of the bell shaped body. Given the advanced visual system of box jellyfish and that the pacemaker signal originates in the vicinity of these eyes, it seems logical to assume that the pacemakers are modified by the visual input. Here, the firing frequency and distribution of inter-signal intervals (ISIs) of single pacemakers are examined in the Caribbean box jellyfish, Tripedalia cystophora. It is shown that the absolute ambient light intensity, if kept constant, has no influence on the signal, but if the intensity changes, it has a major impact on both frequency and ISIs. If the intensity suddenly drops there is an increase in firing frequency, and the ISIs become more homogeneously distributed. A rise in intensity, on the other hand, produces a steep decline in the frequency and makes the ISIs highly variable. These electrophysiological data are correlated with behavioral observations from the natural habitat of the medusae.

15863989|t|Self-reported medication use among adolescents in Kuwait.
15863989|a|OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to describe and examine the pattern of medication use, including age and gender differences among adolescents in Kuwait, and to establish the sources of information on medicines in this age group. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 1,110 male and female students (14-21 years) from 10 randomly selected public schools in Kuwait was conducted. The prevalence of self-medication was estimated. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-medication among the high school students was 92%. The prevalence increased by age from 87% among 14-year-olds to 95% among 18-year-olds. Sixty-five percent of medicines used were for pain relief, 54% for respiratory conditions, 39% for allergic conditions, and 37% for dermatological conditions. Twenty-two percent of medicines were nutritional supplements and vitamins, 21% gastrointestinal products, 17% antidandruff products, 15% hair products, 13% for migraine while 8% were for athlete's foot. Pain relief, respiratory, dermatologic and hair products were more prevalent in female adolescents than in male while antidandruff and athlete's foot preparations were used more by male adolescents. The most common sources of information on medicines were parents. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of self-medication among adolescents in Kuwait is high. Self-medication tended to increase with age and differed between male and female students. Few students consulted pharmacists for information on drugs. There is need to promote the image of the pharmacist in Kuwait as a provider of medication information.

9513804|t|Glycoconjugate profile in plasma and erythrocytes of gastric cancer patients.
9513804|a|The present study has examined the glycoconjugate profile in plasma and erythrocyte membranes of 24 adult male gastric cancer patients and an equal number of age and sex-matched controls. Protein-bound hexose, hexosamine and sialic acid were significantly increased in plasma and erythrocytes of gastric cancer patients compared to controls. Elevation of glycoconjugates in circulation is suggested to be a result of increased shedding by the tumor cells or increased synthesis by liver, due to acute phase response.

16423070|t|Methionine catabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
16423070|a|The catabolism of methionine to methionol and methanethiol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied using (13)C NMR spectroscopy, GC-MS, enzyme assays and a number of mutants. Methionine is first transaminated to alpha-keto-gamma-(methylthio)butyrate. Methionol is formed by a decarboxylation reaction, which yields methional, followed by reduction. The decarboxylation is effected specifically by Ydr380wp. Methanethiol is formed from both methionine and alpha-keto-gamma-(methylthio)butyrate by a demethiolase activity. In all except one strain examined, demethiolase was induced by the presence of methionine in the growth medium. This pathway results in the production of alpha-ketobutyrate, a carbon skeleton, which can be re-utilized. Hence, methionine catabolism is more complex and economical than the other amino acid catabolic pathways in yeast, which use the Ehrlich pathway and result solely in the formation of a fusel alcohol.

18514383|t|Impact of surgical volume on the rate of lymph node metastases in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection for clinically localized prostate cancer.
18514383|a|BACKGROUND: Previous trials have shown that the number of procedures done by a single surgeon, that is, surgical volume (SV), is associated with several outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP). OBJECTIVE: To test the association between SV and the detection of lymph node metastases during extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study cohort consisted of 1020 men surgically treated for clinically localized prostate cancer. INTERVENTION: All patients underwent RP and ePLND by a group of six surgeons who were trained by the surgeon with the highest SV. All surgeons performed an anatomically extended PLND, including removal of obturator, external iliac, and hypogastric nodes. MEASUREMENTS: Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models tested the association between SV (either continuously coded or dichotomized according to the most informative cut-off, namely >144 vs < or =144 ePLNDs) and the rate of lymph node invasion (LNI) after accounting for preoperative (baseline prostate-specific antigen [PSA], clinical stage, biopsy Gleason sum) and postoperative (pathologic stages and Gleason score, surgical margin status) patient characteristics. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Mean number of nodes removed was 19.1 (median, 16; range, 7-63). Mean overall SV was 227 (range, 87-379). Overall, LNI rate was 11.8% (120/1020). No significant differences were found among patients treated by the different surgeons in terms of clinical and pathologic characteristics (all p> or =0.06). Conversely, the surgeon with the highest SV removed more nodes and found more nodal metastases compared with the other surgeons (21.1 vs 17.9 mean number of nodes removed; p<0.001, and 15 vs 9.8% of LNI; p=0.01, respectively). At univariable logistic regression analysis, either continuously coded or dichotomized SV was a significant predictor of LNI (p=0.007 and p<0.001, respectively). In multivariable models, continuously coded as well as dichotomized SV maintained a significant association with the rate of LNI, after accounting for preoperative (p=0.04 and p=0.009, respectively) as well as for postoperative variables (p=0.03 and p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for clinical and pathologic case-mix differences, patients treated by the highest-volume surgeons (>144 ePLNDs) were more likely to have LNI than those treated by low-volume surgeons, even though all surgeons used a similar extended template for node removal.

18199100|t|Primary vesicoureteral reflux mediated renal scarring after urinary tract infection in Thai children.
18199100|a|AIM: To evaluate the association between primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal scarring in children using 99 m Technetium-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). METHODS: Children attending at Songklanagarind Hospital from 1987 to 2002 were evaluated. RESULTS: Ages at diagnosis of VUR in 46 boys and 52 girls were 1.1+/-1.6 and 2.9+/-2.5 years, median 0.6 and 2.3 years, respectively (P<0.001). DMSA scans were performed at 4.1+/-3.6 years. Renal parenchymal damage was detected in 34 kidneys (22%) of 154 demonstrated refluxing ureters, and one kidney (2%) of 42 non-refluxing ureters (P=0.002). Of 79 refluxing ureters in boys and 75 refluxing ureters in girls, there were 25 and nine renal scars, respectively (32% and 12%, P=0.003). Renal scars in VUR grades I-V were 11%, 7%, 12%, 44% and 64%, respectively (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that high grade VUR (P<0.001), age of diagnosis of VUR greater than 5 years (P=0.001), and male gender (P=0.002) were the most significant risk factors for renal scarring. CONCLUSION: High-grade VUR, age of diagnosis of VUR greater than 5 years and male gender were the most significant risk factors for renal scarring.

8741736|t|Characterization of oxalate transport by the human erythrocyte band 3 protein.
8741736|a|This paper describes characteristics of the transport of oxalate across the human erythrocyte membrane. Treatment of cells with low concentrations of H2DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate) inhibits Cl(-)-Cl- and oxalate-oxalate exchange to the same extent, suggesting that band 3 is the major transport pathway for oxalate. The kinetics of oxalate and Cl- self-exchange fluxes indicate that the two ions compete for a common transport site; the apparent Cl- affinity is two to three times higher than that of oxalate. The net exchange of oxalate for Cl-, in either direction, is accompanied by a flux of H+ with oxalate, as is also true of net Cl(-)-SO4(2-) exchange. The transport of oxalate, however, is much faster than that of SO4(2-) or other divalent anions. Oxalate influx into Cl(-)-containing cells has an extracellular pH optimum of approximately 5.5 at 0 degrees C. At extracellular pH below 5.5 (neutral intracellular pH), net Cl(-)-oxalate exchange is nearly as fast as Cl(-)-Cl- exchange. The rapid Cl(-)-oxalate exchange at acid extracellular pH is not likely to be a consequence of Cl- exchange for monovalent oxalate (HOOC-COO-; pKa = 4.2) because monocarboxylates of similar structure exchange for Cl- much more slowly than does oxalate. The activation energy of Cl(-)-oxalate exchange is about 35 kCal/mol at temperatures between 0 and 15 degrees C; the rapid oxalate influx is therefore not a consequence of a low activation energy. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid has no detectable effect on oxalate self-exchange, in contrast to a recent finding in another laboratory (Baggio, B., L. Bordin, G. Clari, G. Gambaro, and V. Moret. 1993. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1148:157-160.); our data provide no evidence for physiological regulation of anion exchange in red cells.

1525016|t|Somitogenesis in the marsupial frog Gastrotheca riobambae.
1525016|a|This paper reports the first description of somitogenesis in a non-aquatic-developing amphibian, the Andean marsupial frog, Gastrotheca riobambae. This frog develops from an embryonic disk located on top of a large yolky egg, bearing some resemblance to the embryo of the chick. Besides the histological characterization of somite formation, we quantified cell number in the developing somites of Gastrotheca, Xenopus laevis and the chick. Gastrotheca was found to have a mode of somitogenesis which has previously been encountered in the aquatic-developing toad Bombina. Somitic cell number was found to be an order of magnitude higher than that of Xenopus, and approximately double that of the chick. We discuss the possible relation between mode of somitogenesis, somitic cell number, speed of development and egg size.

9919715|a|Effects of local administration of atropine into the medial septal nucleus (MSN) and dorsal septal nucleus (DSN) were tested in laboratory rats. Atropine administration led to the development of a spike/wave activity in the hippocampus as well as amygdala within 10 minutes. The frequency of spikes ranged in the absolute values from 20 to 25 spikes per minute in the case of atropine administration to MSN, while in the case of DSN it reached only about 16 spikes per minute. Spike/wave activity outlasted in the EEG record within 2 hours. The average incidence of spikes was somewhat lower in females than in males. A possible relation of the atropine-induced spike/wave activity to another kinds of limbic convulsions is discussed.

2545584|t|Role of glutathione peroxidase in protecting mammalian spermatozoa from loss of motility caused by spontaneous lipid peroxidation.
2545584|a|Mouse and human spermatozoa, but not rabbit spermatozoa, have long been known to be sensitive to loss of motility induced by exogenous H2O2. Recent work has shown that loss of sperm motility in these species correlates with the extent of spontaneous lipid peroxidation. In this study, the effect of H2O2 on this reaction in sperm of the three species was investigated. The rate of spontaneous lipid peroxidation in mouse and human sperm is markedly enhanced in the presence of 1-5 mM H2O2, while the rate in rabbit sperm is unaffected by H2O2. The enhancement of lipid peroxidation, the rate of reaction of H2O2 with the cells, the activity of sperm glutathione peroxidase, and the endogenous glutathione content are highest in mouse sperm, intermediate in human sperm, and very low in rabbit sperm. Inactivation of glutathione peroxidase occurs in the presence of H2O2 due to complete conversion of endogenous glutathione to GSSG: No GSH is available as electron donor substrate to the peroxidase. Inactivation of glutathione peroxidase by the inhibitor mercaptosuccinate has the same effect on rate of lipid peroxidation and loss of motility in mouse and human sperm as does H2O2. This implies that H2O2 by itself at 1-5 mM is not intrinsically toxic to the cells. With merceptosuccinate, the endogenous glutathione is present as GSH in mouse and human sperm, indicating that the redox state of intracellular glutathione by itself plays little role in protecting the cell against spontaneous lipid peroxidation. Mouse and human sperm also have high rates of superoxide production. We conclude that the key intermediate in spontaneous lipid peroxidation is lipid hydroperoxide generated by a chain reaction initiated by and utilizing superoxide. Removal of this hydroperoxide by glutathione peroxidase protects these sperm against peroxidation; inactivation of the peroxidase allows lipid hydroperoxide to increase and so increases the peroxidation rate. Rabbit sperm have low rates of superoxide reaction due to high activity of their superoxide dismutase; lack of endogenous glutathione and low peroxidase activity does not affect their rate of lipid peroxidation. As a result, these sperm are not affected by either H2O2 or mercaptosuccinate. These results lead us to postulate a mechanism for spontaneous lipid peroxidation in mammalian sperm which involves reaction of lipid hydroperoxide and O2 as the rate-determining step.

3257556|t|Intravitreal toxicity of cotrimoxazole.
3257556|a|We investigated the intravitreal toxicity of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim 80 mg and sulfamethoxazole 400 mg/5 ml of injection fluid) in albino rabbits. Eyes injected intravitreally with 1600 micrograms/0.1 cc (reported in trimethoprim concentration) exhibited no histologic or abnormal electroretinographic responses after 14 days. A vitrectomy infusion solution containing 32 micrograms/ml (reported in trimethoprim concentration) produced no toxicity, as demonstrated either by electroretinography or histology. Cotrimoxazole appears to be well-tolerated in rabbit eyes when administered by both intravitreal injection and vitrectomy infusion solution.

9292893|t|IL-10 deficit correlates with chronic, hypersplenomegaly syndrome in male CBA/J mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni.
9292893|a|Twenty weeks after moderate level infections with Schistosoma mansoni, approximately 20% of male CBA/J mice develop hypersplenomegaly syndrome (HSS) while the rest present with moderate splenomegaly syndrome (MSS). HSS and MSS mice differ pathophysiologically (degree of splenomegaly, anaemia, ascites, periportal fibrosis, portal hypertension) and immunologically with regard to antibodies (idiotypic expression, isotype levels) to schistosome soluble egg antigens (SEA), and spleen cell phenotypic profiles. This study compared in vitro proliferative responses and IL-2, IFN gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 production by spleen cells from uninfected mice and mice with acute (8 wk), MSS or HSS schistosomiasis mansoni, upon exposure to anti-CD3 epsilon or SEA, Spleen cells from uninfected mice produce Il-2 to anti-CD3 epsilon but exposure of cells from all three groups of infected mice to anti-CD3 epsilon or SEA led to only very low levels of supernatant IL-2. Anti-CD3 epsilon- or SEA-stimulated production of IFN gamma or Il-4, and anti-CD3 epsilon-stimulated production of IL-10, displayed similar patterns: highest cytokine production by cells from mice with acute infections and lower levels of production that did not differ between the two chronic groups. In contrast, while SEA-stimulated IL-10 production was again highest with cells from mice with acute infections, spleen cells from mice with MSS produced significantly more IL-10 than did those from mice with HSS. This association of low levels of antigen-induced IL-10 with severe pathology is consistent with the theory that IL-10 plays a role in the immunoregulation that occurs in chronic schistosomiasis.

16050249|t|Normal and neoplastic stem cells.
16050249|a|Stem cells are cells that at the single cell level both self-renew and give rise to differentiated progeny. Self renewal is the property that distinguishes stem cells and progenitors, and in the blood-forming system explains why haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), not progenitors, are the only cells capable of providing rapid and sustained regeneration of the blood-forming system after ablation by cancer chemo- and radiotherapies. Cancer-free prospectively purified HSCs regenerate the haematopoietic system of patients as rapidly as a marrow or mobilized blood transplant, but without the risk of re-seeding the body with cancer cells. Further, purified allogeneic HSCs can establish donor-specific tolerance to subsequent tissue grafts. However, in contrast to widely-publicized reports of HSC plasticity, we have not been able to show transdifferentiation of HSC to muscle, heart, brain or gut, and conclude that rare cell fusions and incomplete purifications are likely explanations for the other published results. The ability to self-renew is also potentially dangerous, as poorly regulated self renewal is, we believe, a central lesion in all cancers. We have recently shown that myeloid leukaemias in mouse and human are often driven by rare leukaemia (cancer) stem cells which are at the progenitor stage of differentiation, but have activated the self-renewing cell division pathway normally used only by HSCs. Similar cancer stem cells have been isolated in other tumours.

15015811|t|Organisation for the relief of concentration camps.
15015811|a|OBJECTIVE: To review the essential principles involved in rescue missions for natural and man-made disasters. METHOD: A description of the relief of a concentration camp in 1945 as an example of the logistics required in any major disaster or rescue. RESULTS: The arrival of trained Army rescue teams on the first day and dealing systematically with priorities in salvage, treatment and nursing saved many lives, even of desperately ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: A centralised administration and organisation of supplies is the first priority. Suitable intravenous and very light nutrients, and the prevention and combating of infections are more urgent than the provision of shelter and clothing.

17467747|t|Long-term effects of oral vitamin C supplementation on the endothelial dysfunction in the iris microvessels of diabetic rats.
17467747|a|The current study was aimed to investigate effects of long-term supplementation of vitamin C on the iris microcirculation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar-Furth rats by intravenous injection of STZ (55 mg/kg b.w.). The rats were divided into three groups: control rats (CON), STZ-induced diabetic rats (STZ), and STZ rats supplemented with vitamin C (STZ-vitC). For supplementation of vitamin C, ascorbic acid (1 g/l) was added into the drinking water. The experiments were performed at different periods (8, 12, 24 and 36 weeks) after injection of STZ. Blood glucose, tissue lipid peroxidation and plasma vitamin C were measured. To examine the endothelial function, leukocyte adhesion to the venular endothelium was evaluated in the iris post-capillaries by means of counting the number of leukocytes labeled with rhodamine 6G. Blood flow perfusion in the iris was monitored using a laser Doppler flow meter. In the STZ rats, hyperglycemia was induced with an increase in HbA(1c) and lipid peroxidation but with a decrease in the plasma vitamin C level which improved by vitamin C supplementation. The number of adherent leukocytes increased significantly, associated with reduction in the iris blood flow perfusion, at 8, 12, 24 and 36 weeks after injection of STZ. In the STZ-vitC rats, the iris blood flow perfusion was significantly increased in comparison with the STZ rats, while the leukocyte adhesion was decreased at 24 and 36 weeks. The statistical analysis shows that the leukocyte adhesion decreased with increase in the iris blood flow perfusion in STZ and STZ-vitC rats. In conclusion, vitamin supplementation suppressed leukocyte adhesion and thus endothelial dysfunction, associated with increase in iris blood flow perfusion in diabetes. The antioxidant vitamin C may be a therapeutic agent for preventing diabetic retinopathy.

10639845|t|Some clinical factors contributing to the development of the diabetic foot.
10639845|a|Clinical neurological studies, blood pressure measurements and some haematological investigations were performed on a random sample of forty-four patients, at the Diabetes Out-Patient Clinic of the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI), to examine some of the factors that predispose to the development of the diabetic foot. Our results revealed that 86% of the patients had elevated glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1 > 9.0%), 82% had clinical signs of peripheral sensory neuropathy, 29% had signs of autonomic neuropathy in addition to peripheral sensory neuropathy. Sixty-one per cent (61%) of the patients had ankle/arm systolic blood pressure ratio less than 1.0 and were diagnosed as having peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The group with neuropathy was found to have a significantly lower diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.0005) than the group without neuropathy. We believe that hyperglycaemia-induced vasodilation (indicated by a lower diastolic blood pressure) in a significant number of diabetics resulted in compensatory shunting of blood from the deeper tissues, including nerves, to the periphery. The resulting endoneural hypoxia could be responsible for the unusually high incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy detected in this sample of diabetic patients. Metabolic factors may also play a role.

10831381|t|Fasciola hepatica: an antigen fraction derived from newly excysted juveniles, containing an immunoreactive 32-kDa protein, induces strong protective immunity in rats.
10831381|a|Crude antigens of adult Fasciola hepatica and of newly excysted juveniles (NEJ) and a low-molecular-weight fraction of antigen from NEJs were tested for inducing protective immunity in rats. Two routes of vaccination were applied. The results showed that intraperitoneal vaccination induced significantly better protection (P <0.05) than intramuscular vaccination. Intraperitoneal vaccination with antigens from NEJs induced more effective protection: after challenge infection, rats that were so vaccinated had 92.6% (+/-2.5% SEM) fewer parasites in their liver and 57.3% (+/-13.3% SEM) fewer parasites penetrating the gut wall than control rats. Rats that were vaccinated with a low-molecular-weight fraction of antigen from NEJs were also highly protected against a challenge. F. hepatica antigens that are immunoreactive were identified on immunoblots, using sera collected from highly protected rats that had been vaccinated with NEJ antigens and also sera from cattle and rats that were experimentally infected with F. hepatica. The low-molecular-weight fraction of antigen from NEJs contained an immunodominant 32-kDa protein that was recognized by serum antibodies of vaccinated rats and immune cattle. This 32-kDa protein was not detected in partially purified antigens from adult flukes. We conclude that antigens of NEJs of F. hepatica, when injected intraperitoneally in rats, are highly protective. In particular, the 32-kDa protein contained in these antigens may be highly valuable for the development of an effective vaccine against F. hepatica.

9427092|t|Typology of disruptive vocalizations in older persons suffering from dementia.
9427092|a|Verbal and vocal disruptive behaviors (VDB) are important clinical features in dementia because they frequently signal discomfort experienced by an elderly person and because they are disturbing to caregivers, thereby affecting the care of elderly persons manifesting them. This article describes a typology of VDB, the Typology of Vocalizations-TOV. The conceptual framework underlying the development of this typology includes the assumptions that VDB consist of more than one type of behavior and that interventions should be matched to the etiology of the specific type of VDB. The article reports interrater reliability of the typology and validates it against Ryan's classification of verbal and vocal disruptive behaviors. Critical dimensions of the typology are examined and used for its refinement. Finally, use of the TOV for matching individuals to the most effective intervention is demonstrated.

7973080|t|Isolation and preliminary characterisation of a previously unidentified Theileria parasite of cattle in Kenya.
7973080|a|A Theileria parasite was isolated from cattle on a ranch in Kenya where it caused mild theileriosis in approximately one third of the cattle exposed to natural tick challenge. The parasite was isolated by inoculation of blood into two experimental cattle. Blood from one of these cattle was used to infect two splenectomised cattle which developed high piroplasm parasitaemias and severe anaemia. A blood stabilate was prepared from one of the splenectomised cattle and produced high parasitaemias in splenectomised cattle. Immunofluorescence tests showed that the unidentified Theileria species was distinct from other African Theileria and Babesia species of cattle. The Theileria species was shown to be antigenically distinct by means of species-specific monoclonal antibodies. The piroplasma stage was relatively large for a Theileria parasite and erythrocyte infections were usually associated with veils and bars. The salivary glands of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, R pulchellus, R evertsi and Amblyomma variegatum fed on parasitaemic cattle did not become infected and these ticks failed to transmit the parasite. It was concluded that this parasite represented a new species of cattle Theileria in Kenya.

16203839|t|Pediatric window falls: not just a problem for children in high rises.
16203839|a|BACKGROUND: Window falls are a frequent cause of injury (15/100,000) among Chicago preschool children. In Boston and New York, public health efforts have successfully decreased window fall injuries. Local data are needed to develop appropriate interventions for Chicago. OBJECTIVE: To describe the housing characteristics and types of injuries among children who fell from windows treated in a Chicago pediatric trauma center. METHODS: Children treated in a pediatric trauma center for injuries related to window falls between 1995 and 2002 were identified retrospectively. We reviewed family demographics, the circumstances of the fall, and types of injuries. Site visits were performed to determine the height and type of building and type of window where the fall took place. RESULTS: The authors reviewed 90 cases; 55 were male. The median age was 2 years. Ninety eight percent of falls were reported to be from the third floor or lower. Site visits (n=77) showed that 96% of the buildings were four storeys or lower. The median length of hospital stay was two days (range 0--24 days). The most common injuries were head trauma and extremity fractures. Three patients died, and an additional three patients were discharged to rehabilitation centers. CONCLUSIONS: Some window falls result in serious injury. In Chicago, most falls were from modest heights (2nd/3rd floor windows) in buildings of four or fewer storeys, rather than from "high rises". Strategies to prevent window falls should be directed to the owners and occupants of this type of housing.

2346544|t|Relative bioavailability of fluoride from monofluorophosphate tablets after single oral administration.
2346544|a|The study was conducted on 12 healthy male Caucasian volunteers of an average age of 27.8 +/- 4.0 years with single oral doses of the following products: 1. sodium monofluorophosphate tablets (MFP-tablets, Mono-Tridin); 2. aqueous solution of 23.2 mg of sodium fluoride (NaF solution-reference); 3. aqueous solution of sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP solution). The three products were equivalent in fluorine content with 10.5 mg F. The bioavailability was evaluated on the basis of the plasma levels and of the urinary excretion of fluoride. The study was designed as a triple latin-square crossover and each subject received the three products in three different periods, at empty stomach. After administration of the products, fluoride appeared quickly in blood (lag time between 0.07 and 0.13 h) and invaded rapidly the blood (invasion t1/2 from 0.04 to 0.15 h). The Cmax of fluoride in plasma was 439 ng/ml at tmax of 1.08 h after MFP tablets, 430 ng/ml at a tmax of 0.51 h after NaF solution and 403 ng/ml at tmax of 0.62 h after MFP solution. The differences for the Cmax were not statistically significant. The relative bioavailability of fluoride from MFP tablets, estimated from the AUC, was 1.35, and significantly larger than that from the reference NaF solution. Fluoride was eliminated from plasma with an initial fast rate (t1/2 from 0.68 to 1.03 h) and a terminal slower rate (t1/2 from 4.71 to 7.37 h). The plasma levels of fluoride were consistent with a two-compartment open pharmacokinetic model after extravascular administration. In the 24 h following the administration the urinary excretion of fluoride accounted for 50-53% of the administered dose, without significant difference between the three products. The three products were well tolerated and no systemic or gastric adverse reaction was recorded.

6279288|t|Protective effects of S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid against radiation damage of normal tissues and a fibrosarcoma in mice.
6279288|a|S-2-(3-Aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721) was investigated for its protective effect against radiation-produced damage of jejunum, testis, lung, hair follicles, and a fibrosarcoma of C3Hf/Kam mice. Most of these tissues were radioprotected, and the degree of radioprotection depended on the dose of WR-2721 and the time interval between administration of WR-2721 and radiation treatment. WR-2721 increased resistance of jejunal epithelial cells and spermatogenic cells to single doses of gamma-rays by factors of 1.64 and 1.54, respectively. Protection against hair loss was less pronounced; the dose-modifying factor here was 1.24. The radiation-induced acute damage of the lung expressed by the increased formation of tumor nodules in the lung was not decreased by treatment of animals with WR-2721 before radiation. In contrast, WR-2721 augmented the radiation-induced enhancement of metastasis formation in the lung. WR-2721 protected fibrosarcoma micrometastases in the lung against therapeutic effect of radiation by a factor of 1.238. In contrast, this compound had no effect on the therapy of an 8-mm fibrosarcoma growing in the legs of mice.

10929875|a|The distribution and antibiotic resistance of major pathogens isolated from patients in ICUs were studied by three Italian microbiological laboratories. Consecutive aerobic strains were collected over two different time periods from protected brushing bronchoscopy, broncho-alveolar lavage and blood cultures. A total of 420 strains were isolated during the first period (47.3% gram-negative and 52.7% gram-positive) and 412 over the second period (50.5% gram-negative and 49.5% gram-positive). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated organism from the respiratory tract followed by Staphylococcus aureus. Methicillin resistance was 47.9 and 44.5% in S. aureus and 63.0 and 65.1% in coagulase-negative staphylococci over the two periods. No glycopeptide-resistance was found in gram-positive organisms. Ceftazidime-resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae was very high.

11198593|t|Successful renal transplantation in children under 6 years of age.
11198593|a|To evaluate the efficacy of renal transplantation in small pediatric patients, we have reviewed 41 allografts performed in 39 children (28 M/11 F) less than 6 years of age between 1987 and 1998 in the North Italy Transplant Program. Of these patients, 39 had a cadaver donor and 2 a living-related donor, with ages ranging from 20 days to 35 years. The mean follow-up was 56 months. Graft survival was 74.5% and 70.5% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. The causes of graft lost were acute rejection (4), graft vascular thrombosis (4), and hemolytic uremic syndrome recurrence (1). Only 1 patient has died due to chickenpox. Double and triple immunosuppressive therapies were used in 63% and 37% of patients, respectively, on the basis of different center protocols, without differences in graft survival. Steroids were successfully administered on alternate days in 37% of patients, 6-12 months after transplantation. Thrombosis was reported in 2 of 6 kidneys from donors less than 1 year of age and in 2 of 35 donors older than 1 year (P < 0.05). Thirty rejections occurred in 23 patients: 7 episodes were steroid resistant and were treated with ATG/OKT3. Thirty-four infections were reported in 16 of 41 patients; of these 17 were viral, 14 bacterial, and 3 due to Mycoplasma. Four surgical complications were reported: 1 graft artery stenosis, 1 ureteral stenosis, 1 urinary leak, and 1 lymphocele. Mean height standard deviation score improved from -2.0 +/- 1.3 pre transplantation to -1.8 +/- 1.4, -1.5 +/- 1.3, and -1.5 +/- 1.5 at 1, 2, and 5 years post transplantation. Linear growth was significantly better in infants treated with alternate-day steroids. Hypertension was a frequent complication, since 19 of the 30 patients with a 5-year follow-up were still being treated with antihypertensive drugs. In conclusion, graft survival in patients less than 6 years old is satisfactory and similar to that obtained in children aged from 6 to 18 years (70.5% vs. 78.9% at 5 years, P = NS). Consequently, since there are many difficulties in managing infants on maintenance dialysis, an early transplant should be considered. Donors older than 24 months carry a low risk of vascular thrombosis and may be successfully grafted in infants.

METHODS: Ninety three patients were identified showing subcortical or brainstem DWI lesions <1.5 cm in diameter within a maximum of 7 days from the onset of stroke symptoms. The patients' clinical status on admission was reviewed according to the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP). The results of procedures searching for cerebrovascular risk factors, large artery disease, and potential sources of cardiac embolism were included to determine stroke aetiology. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were also reviewed for concomitant changes that could support the aetiologic classification. RESULTS: Only 41 (44.1%) patients presented clinically with a lacunar syndrome according to OCSP criteria. The nine (9.7%) patients who showed two or more DWI lesions in different vascular territories were also significantly more likely to have potential sources of cardiac embolism (5/9, 55.6% v 20/84, 23.8%). Hypertension was significantly more prevalent in the group of patients who showed a microangiopathy related imaging pattern, but this pattern did not exclude the presence of large artery disease or a possible cardioembolic source of stroke. CONCLUSION: Identification of small subcortical infarctions as the cause of stroke appears quite uncertain based on clinical characteristics only. DWI adds significant aetiologic information but does not obviate the search for other potentially causative mechanisms.

4082468|t|Review of veterinary cases received by the Hennepin Poison Center in 1984.
4082468|a|During 1984 the Hennepin Poison Center documented 28, 141 poison exposures. Of these, 1,092 or 3.88% were veterinary exposures. In this study we review those animal cases and present data on the relative number of species involved, the nature of the contaminants, frequency of calls during different times of the day and different times of year. We also report on the number of symptomatic animals, routes of exposure and referral patterns. We will also give brief reports on veterinary cases of particular interest.

17012216|t|How golden is silence? Teaching undergraduates the power and limits of RNA interference.
17012216|a|It is hard and getting harder to strike a satisfying balance in teaching. Time dedicated to student-generated models or ideas is often sacrificed in an effort to "get through the syllabus." I describe a series of RNA interference (RNAi) experiments for undergraduate students that simultaneously explores fundamental concepts in gene regulation, develops cutting-edge laboratory skills, and embraces student-directed learning. Students design a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against luciferase, add it to cells expressing this gene, and then quantitatively assess the siRNA's effect on both intended and unintended targets, using a luciferase assay and a DNA microarray. Because both RNAi and microarray technologies are relatively new, with no clear consensus on their analysis or limitations, students are encouraged to explore different approaches to the design of their reagents and interpretations of their data. The ability to creatively formulate a hypothesis-driven experimental approach to a scientific question and to critically evaluate collected data is stressed. Equally important, this experiment emphasizes how modern scientific ideas emerge, are debated, tested, and decided.

10609583|t|Are we a gift shop? A perspective on grade inflation.
10609583|a|Grade inflation is a phenomenon that has been written about extensively since the mid 1970s. It is theorized that it made its initial appearance as an adjustment to the rigorous educational standards that were imposed in the post-Sputnik era. Some authors speculate that grade inflation as we know it is an outcome of student demands for high grades combined with faculty willingness to capitulate to them. Others believe the problem is related to lack of faculty knowledge about evaluation methods, or the quest for positive student evaluations in support of promotion, tenure, and merit decisions. Of particular concern is the lack of published studies of grade inflation in nursing education. The purpose of this article is to describe what we know about grade inflation-its history, causative factors, and implications for nursing.

11771897|t|Roscovitine, a specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent protein kinases, reversibly inhibits chromatin condensation during in vitro maturation of porcine oocytes.
11771897|a|In the present study the effects of roscovitine on the in vitro nuclear maturation of porcine oocytes were investigated. Roscovitine, a specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent protein kinases, prevented chromatin condensation in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition was reversible and was accompanied by non-activation of p34cdc2/histone H1 kinase. It also decreased enzyme activity of MAP kinase, suggesting a correlation between histone H1 kinase activation and the onset of chromatin condensation. The addition of roscovitine (50 microM) to extracts of metaphase II oocytes revealed that the MAP kinase activity was not directly affected by roscovitine, which indicates a possible link between histone H1 and MAP kinase. Chromatin condensation occurred between 20 and 28 h of culture of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) in inhibitor-free medium (germinal vesicle stage I, GV1: 74.6% and 13.7%, respectively). Nearly the same proportion of chromatin condensation was detected in COCs incubated initially in inhibitor-free medium for 20-28 h and subsequently in roscovitine-supplemented medium (50 microM) for a further 2-10 h (GV I: 76.2% and 18.8%, respectively). This observation indicates that roscovitine prevents chromatin condensation even after an initial inhibitor-free cultivation for 20 h. Extending this initial incubation period to > or = 22 h led to an activation of histone H1 and MAP kinase and increasing proportions of oocytes exhibiting chromatin condensation in the presence of roscovitine. It is concluded that histone H1 kinase is involved in the induction of chromatin condensation during in vitro maturation of porcine oocytes.
