# EE361M Semester Project Ideas

# Projects based on Type of Analysis/Application Domain

## [Projects Ghosh is interested in:](http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/courses/ppmi.htm)

### 1. Ranking/Recommendations with Monotonic Retargeting
Working on a large Recommender system with contextual information for book/reading website (with data from Prof. Constantine Caramanis) -- this looks really cool, and I know this was done as a senior design project last year. We could probably get something decent up and running in a short-ish amount of time, and pick up some practical experience along the way. This wouldn't be as cutting-edge, though.

### 2. Healthcare predictive modeling with variable resolution data
This type of problem is interesting from a moral/societal benefit perspective, although I think it would requrie a lot of domain-specific knowledge... not necessarily what we want.

### 3. Imbalanced Classification Problems:
This class of problem looks interesting too, as important real-world topics like Anomaly detection fall under this category.



# Competitions/Large Real-World Datasets

## Yahoo Datasets:
### [S5 - A Labeled Anomaly Detection Dataset, version 1.0(16M):](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s)
Description: Automatic anomaly detection is critical in today's world where the sheer volume of data makes it impossible to tag outliers manually. The goal of this dataset is to benchmark your anomaly detection algorithm. The dataset consists of real and synthetic time-series with tagged anomaly points. The dataset tests the detection accuracy of various anomaly-types including outliers and change-points. The synthetic dataset consists of time-series with varying trend, noise and seasonality. The real dataset consists of time-series representing the metrics of various Yahoo services.

## Various public datsets:
