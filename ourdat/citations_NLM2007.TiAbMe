7025153|a|Twenty infrequently reported species of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli other than Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and members of the genus Bacteroides were studied with regard to their role in infection and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. In addition, the literature regarding the recovery of these organisms from both the normal flora and infections of humans was reviewed. During a six-year period at the Wadsworth Clinical Anaerobic Bacteriology Research Laboratory (Veterans Administration Wadsworth Medical Center, Los Angeles, Calif.), 39 (6%) of 679 specimens obtained from anaerobic infections yielded "other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli" (OGNAB). Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium russii were the most commonly isolated OGNAB. Most of the OGNAB tested were resistant to erythromycin, and most strains, except for F. varium, were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics and clindamycin. Chloramphenicol and metronidazole were active against all strains of OGNAB tested. Certain Fusobacterium species are undoubtedly previously unrecognized members of the normal flora of the oropharynx, upper respiratory tract, or urogenital tract and may be present in infections derived from these floras.

9021207|a|Ketolides, a novel macrolide subclass, possess a mode of action that is similar to that of structurally related macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) compounds. By using reference in vitro tests, the in vitro activity of RU-64004 was compared to those of six other MLS compounds against more than 800 clinical pathogens, including 356 gram-positive organisms. The spectrum of activity of the ketolide was most similar to that of clindamycin versus staphylococci and streptococci and superior to those of all macrolides tested against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant (vanA, vanB, and vanC) enterococcal isolates. The activity of the ketolide was greater than those of the macrolides, azalides, or clindamycin tested against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC90S], 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and most beta-hemolytic streptococci. All Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococcus strain were inhibited by ketolide concentrations of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against 165 erythromycin-resistant strains, RU-64004 inhibited (MICs, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml) approximately one-third of staphylococci, all streptococci, and slightly more than one-half of the enterococci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin (a streptogramin combination) was active against all tested isolates with the exception of non-Enterococcus faecium enterococci, against which the ketolide exhibited greater potency (MIC50S, 0.03 to 2 micrograms/ml). The ketolide was also active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml), pathogenic Neisseria spp. (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), and many gram-positive anaerobes (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). RU-64004 may enhance the role of macrolide drugs in the treatment of some serious infections caused by MLS-resistant gram-positive organisms.

9127099|a|A new macrolide subclass called ketolides, possess a mode of action similar to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) compounds. Utilizing reference in vitro tests, the in vitro activity of RU-66647 (a ketolide) was compared to other MLS compounds against 376 Gram-positive organisms and over 400 representative strains of Gram-negative bacilli. The ketolide's spectrum was most similar to clindamycin and an earlier drug in the series (RU-64004 or RU-004) against staphylococci and streptococci. However, RU-66647 was more active than erythromycin and azithromycin against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Ketolide activity was more potent than other MLS drugs against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC90, 0.25-4 micrograms/ml) and all streptococci (MICs, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). Erythromycin-resistant (constitutive) strains were generally inhibited by < or = 2 micrograms RU-66647/ml (staphylococci, 31 to 36%; streptococci, 100%; enterococci, 72%). RU-66647 was active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/ml), and pathogenic Neisseria spp. (MIC90 0.5 microgram/ml). The ketolide failed to inhibit Enterobacteriaceae, nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli, and Bacteriodes fragilis group strains. RU-66647 was observed to be a promising new compound directed toward some organisms resistant to other MLS-class drugs.

The ketolide was more potent than other macrolides against erythromycin A-susceptible staphylococci and was generally more potent than clindamycin against erythromycin A-resistant strains susceptible to this agent. Clindamycin-resistant staphylococci (MIC, > 128 microg/ml) proved resistant to the ketolide, but some erythromycin A- and clindamycin-resistant enterococci remained susceptible to RU 64004.

8381817|a|The Oxyrase agar dilution method, with exclusion of CO2 from the environment, was compared with the reference agar dilution method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (anaerobic chamber with 10% CO2) to test the susceptibility of 51 gram-negative and 43 gram-positive anaerobes to azithromycin and erythromycin. With the Oxyrase method, anaerobiosis was achieved by incorporation of the O2-binding enzyme Oxyrase in addition to susceptibility test medium, antibiotic, and enzyme substrates into the upper level of a biplate. Plates were covered with a Brewer lid and incubated in ambient air. With azithromycin, Oxyrase yielded an MIC for 50% of strains tested (MIC50) and MIC90 of 2.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, compared to 8.0 and > 32.0 micrograms/ml in standard anaerobic conditions. At a breakpoint of 8.0 micrograms/ml, 90.4% of strains were susceptible to azithromycin with Oxyrase, compared to 53.2% in the chamber. The corresponding erythromycin MIC50 and MIC90 were 1.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml with Oxyrase, compared to 4.0 and > 32.0 micrograms/ml by the reference method, with 89.3% of strains susceptible at a breakpoint of 4 micrograms/ml with Oxyrase, compared to 60.6% in CO2. Exclusion of CO2 from the anaerobic atmosphere when testing for susceptibility to azalides and macrolides yielded lower MICs, which may lead to a reconsideration of the role played by these compounds in treatment of infections caused by these strains.

8192445|a|The Oxyrase agar dilution method (Oxyrase, Inc., Mansfield, Ohio), which provides an anaerobic environment without added CO2, was compared with the reference agar dilution method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (anaerobic chamber with 10% CO2) to test the susceptibilities of 302 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin. For erythromycin, the overall MIC for 50% of isolates tested (MIC50) was 0.5 micrograms/ml and the MIC90 was 8.0 micrograms/ml by the Oxyrase method, whereas they were 4.0 and 64.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, under standard anaerobic conditions with CO2. At a breakpoint of 4.0 micrograms/ml, 88% of strains were susceptible to erythromycin by the Oxyrase method, whereas 63% were susceptible in the chamber. The corresponding MIC50s and MIC90s of azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin by the Oxyrase method were 0.5 and 8.0, 0.25 and 4.0, and 0.5 and 16.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, whereas in the chamber they were 4.0 and > 64.0, 2.0 and 64.0, and 2.0 and 64.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. At a breakpoint of 8.0 micrograms/ml for these three drugs, 89, 92, and 85% of the isolates, respectively, were susceptible by the Oxyrase method, whereas 67%, 72, and 68% of the isolates, respectively, were susceptible in the chamber. Most strains resistant to all four compounds by both methods were Bacteroides distasonis, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium varium and non-Clostridium perfringens Clostridium species. Results of the study may lead to a reappraisal of the role played by macrolides and azalides in the treatment of anaerobic infections.

Clinical diagnostic procedures did not reveal the cause of sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive symptomatic therapy could not prevent progressive deterioration. The patient developed septic shock and consumptive coagulopathy and died 6 days after admission. Autopsy revealed disseminated infection with toxoplasma gondii and multiple organ manifestations. We conclude that disseminated toxoplasmosis should be considered in AIDS patients with septic disease of unknown origin. Extremely elevated lactate dehydrogenase may suggest disseminated toxoplasma gondii infection. New procedures such as polymerase chain reaction for detection of toxoplasmosis may be helpful diagnostic tools.

2768467|a|We applied the polymerase chain reaction to detection of the pathogenic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii based on our identification of a 35-fold-repetitive gene (the B1 gene) as a target. Using this procedure, we were able to amplify and detect the DNA of a single organism directly from a crude cell lysate. This level of sensitivity also allowed us to detect the B1 gene from purified DNA samples containing as few as 10 parasites in the presence of 100,000 human leukocytes. This is representative of the maximal cellular infiltration (10(5)/ml) in 1 ml of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis. The B1 gene is present and conserved in all six T. gondii strains tested to date, including two isolates from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. No signal was detected by using this assay and DNAs from a variety of other organisms, including several which might be found in the central nervous system of an immunocompromised host. This combination of sensitivity and specificity should make detection of the B1 gene based on polymerase chain reaction amplification a very useful method for diagnosis of toxoplasmosis both in immunocompromised hosts and in congenitally infected fetuses.

A negative correlation was evidenced between sensitivity of the test and the amount of cellular debris contaminating the DNA to be amplified. Nevertheless, the method was tested on 100 clinical specimens subjected to lysis using the same method. Among the 88 specimens from AIDS patients, four were positive by conventional diagnostic tests and by PCR. Among the 12 specimens tested as part of evaluations for the prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis, PCR failed to detect the positive results yielded by conventional tests on two amniotic fluid specimens.

8365812|a|In recent years, toxoplasmosis has become one of the most frequent and life-threatening opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. Despite strict clinical follow-up and repeated biological examinations, its diagnosis remains difficult to establish in the context of immunodeficiency because of the poor predictive value of serology. The aim of the study was to compare standard methods of diagnosis with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in an attempt to investigate the potential usefulness of PCR in the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Twelve biological samples (cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, one brain biopsy and one liver biopsy) from 11 unselected AIDS patients were tested by PCR. The results showed good correlation (for eight out of 11 patients) between classical methods and PCR, and confirm the value of bronchoalveolar lavage for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients. The pathophysiological significance of the presence of Toxoplasma in samples tested is discussed.

7494040|a|To investigate whether both tissue culture and PCR on a sequence from the repetitive rDNA could contribute to the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis, blood samples and, if they were available, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and aqueous humor samples from 72 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients with suspected toxoplasmosis were prospectively tested. For 10 patients with fever of unknown origin but without confirmed toxoplasmosis, no Toxoplasma gondii was detected. For two patients with confirmed toxoplasmic uveitis, only PCR of aqueous humor samples was positive. Of 60 patients (48 with CSF samples) with neurological signs, 25 (from 13 of whom CSF samples were available) had confirmed cerebral toxoplasmosis and 10 had a positive PCR of CSF and/or blood samples, while for 1 patient culture of the CSF sample was also positive. Unlike tissue culture, PCR of rDNA is of value for the detection of cerebral toxoplasmosis in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients, provided that both CSF and blood samples are available (sensitivity, 76.9%; specificity, 100%).

8349765|a|Detection of Toxoplasma gondii in blood by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may facilitate the diagnosis and follow-up of cerebral toxoplasmosis in patients with AIDS. We evaluated this approach with seven patients with tissue culture-proven parasitemia, 14 patients with presumptive cerebral toxoplasmosis, and 17 healthy human immunodeficiency virus-positive controls. Each sample of blood was assayed on three different occasions by a PCR assay based on detection of the gene encoding the P30 surface protein. A positive PCR diagnosis required positivity in at least two of the three PCR tests. None of the controls had a positive PCR diagnosis, but six of the seven patients with parasitemia did. Cerebral toxoplasmosis was confirmed in 13 of the 14 patients with a presumptive diagnosis; diagnosis by PCR was positive before treatment for 9 of these 13 patients, whereas tissue culture was positive for only 1 patient. During treatment, blood samples were taken from 14 patients at regular intervals until day 12. PCR diagnosis became negative on ethidium-stained gels, but persistent signals were observed after hybridization, in some cases, for up to 12 days after initiation of therapy. PCR on venous blood could thus be a sensitive and noninvasive method for the diagnosis of cerebral and disseminated toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients and could be a potential tool for monitoring the effects of treatment.

8568525|a|The diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE), a typically focal disease resulting from reactivation of tissue cysts, relies mainly on indirect diagnostic methods. In a prospective study, we investigated the value of detection of Toxoplasma gondii in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by using the polymerase chain reaction and the mouse inoculation test. Twenty-four patients with 26 episodes of TE, 2 HIV-infected patients with primary acute Toxoplasma infection, and 38 HIV-infected control patients with latent Toxoplasma infection were investigated. Detection of T. gondii in CSF by both methods was possible in only 3 of the TE patients (11.5%), the remaining patients being negative with either of the methods. In contrast, T. gondii DNA was detected in both of the acutely infected patients, indicating that in primary acute toxoplasmosis parasites may easily be found in the CSF, whereas in the majority of TE cases in immunocompromised patients, T. gondii parasites do not gain access to the CSF drawn by lumbar puncture.

7494017|a|Intestinal microsporidiosis has been implicated as a major cause of chronic diarrhea in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. So far diagnosis depends on direct visualization of the parasites by light and transmission electron microscopy. We evaluated the diagnostic value of microsporidian DNA amplification by PCR on duodenal biopsy specimens obtained from patients with and without intestinal microsporidiosis caused by Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Thirteen HIV-infected patients (all CDC stage C3) were studied. Eight patients had intestinal microsporidiosis caused by E. bieneusi (n = 6), Septata intestinalis (n = 1), and Encephalitozoon cuniculi (n = 1); microsporidioses were diagnosed by light microscopy of stool samples and confirmed by light and electron microscopy of intestinal biopsy specimens. Five patients had no microsporidia in their stool samples or in their intestinal biopsy specimens, as examined by light and electron microscopy. Additionally, DNA prepared from Toxoplasma gondii derived from mouse ascites was used as a further control. A 353-bp DNA fragment of the small-subunit rRNA gene could be amplified from all six biopsy specimens infected with E. bieneusi, and the nature of the PCR products was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. No amplification of DNA fragments was seen by using DNA extracted from biopsy specimens with S. intestinalis or E. cuniculi infection or without microsporidian infection and with template DNA extracted from T. gondii. The results suggest that PCR testing of intestinal biopsy specimens may be a useful approach to diagnosing microsporidiosis in HIV-infected patients.

DNA products of correct size could be amplified from all examined tissues with S. intestinalis infection but also from 2 biopsies with Enterocytozoon bieneusi and from 1 biopsy with Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection. Southern blot hybridization with an S. intestinalis-specific probe and partial sequencing of the DNA fragments showed high homology with published S. intestinalis sequences and confirmed that the amplified PCR products really derived from the SSU-rRNA gene of S. intestinalis. PCR testing can detect very light infections with S. intestinalis. Thus, S. intestinalis seems to occur more frequently in the form of latent infections and the true prevalence of the parasites may be much higher than previously reported.

8432803|a|Amplification of DNA sequences from ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was tested as a specific and sensitive method for the detection of small numbers of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoite cells. We applied the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the basis of detection of the 110-fold repetitive rDNA as a target by using (i) DNA sequences within the small ribosomal subunit known to be universal and conserved in all eukaryotes and (ii) small ribosomal subunit and intergenic spacer rDNA sequences known to be T. gondii species specific. The level of sensitivity obtained from a crude cell lysate allowed the detection of as few as one parasite visualized directly as a specific PCR product in agarose gels. By using a combination of universal and T. gondii species-specific primers, we propose a comultiplex-based PCR approach as a new diagnostic tool. The combination of sensitivity, specificity, and built-in positive and negative PCR controls should make detection of the rDNA sequences by comultiplex PCR a useful clinical test for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis and for epidemiological studies. Finally, the idea of a built-in positive control to support or counter the T. gondii-specific PCR result is novel and is a notable advance.

1452701|a|Diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infection is difficult, especially in immunosuppressed people. The AIDS epidemic has increased the number of people at risk and increased the need for better diagnostic methods. We have compared three methods for detection of T. gondii parasitemia. Rabbits were infected subcutaneously with 10(4) T. gondii tachyzoites. Blood samples were obtained, and buffy coat or leukocyte fractions were prepared. We sought the T. gondii B1 gene by gene amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, and we sought viable T. gondii cells by inoculating fibroblast cell cultures and by mouse inoculation. Thirty-two blood samples were obtained from seven infected rabbits, and 18 were obtained from four control, uninfected rabbits. Parasitemia was detected in 20 of 32 samples (62%) from infected samples by mouse inoculation, 12 of 32 samples (37%) by gene amplification and detection, and 8 of 32 samples (25%) by cell culture. Mouse inoculation requires use of live animals and has a long turnaround time. Currently, cell culture is the least sensitive but most practical and widely available method for the detection of T. gondii parasitemia. Gene amplification and detection was more sensitive than cell culture and may become available in clinical laboratories as techniques are developed further and automated.

2071911|a|Cerebral toxoplasmosis is a life-threatening condition associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Current diagnostic and therapeutic methods have serious limitations. The diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasma infection in a patient with AIDS was assisted by the detection of specific IgM in a highly sensitive immunosorbent agglutination assay and by the demonstration of Toxoplasma gondii nucleic acid in a brain biopsy specimen by means of the polymerase chain reaction. Following initial failure of the patient to respond to treatment with sulphadiazine and pyrimethamine, clinical improvement was observed during treatment with clindamycin followed by dapsone. Further assessment of novel methods in the management of cerebral toxoplasmosis is required.

1430262|a|To assess the value of detecting Toxoplasma gondii in human blood samples using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Blood samples in lithium heparin were examined from 34 patients with suspected toxoplasmosis, and six healthy volunteers with or without the addition of doubling dilutions of toxoplasma tachyzoites. Products of a nested PCR, using oligonucleotide primers of the B1 gene, were analysed by electrophoresis and stained by ethidium bromide. The primary product was 194 base pairs in length; the nested products were 160 or 97 base pairs.When toxoplasma tachyzoites were added to the leucocytes of six different volunteers, eight to 16 parasites were detected by nested PCR in one experiment and one to four parasites in eight experiments. All nine experiments were negative in samples without added tachyzoites. Of 34 patients, PCR was negative in 13 with recent lymphadenopathy; nine with persisting IgM, including two pregnant patients; four with reactivated infection due to immunodeficiency; and five with no evidence of active infection. Positive PCR results were found in three patients with reactivated infection. There was only one discrepancy between PCR and animal culture results; this was in an immunocompromised patient with a positive PCR and negative culture.The PCR technique was rapid, sensitive, and specific in human blood samples. Negative PCR results in patients with persisting IgM suggested that the fetus was not at risk, or that treatment was not indicated in myalgic encephalomyelitis-like illness. PCR results in immunocompromised patients permitted appropriate management--no treatment if negative, treatment if positive.

8473761|a|Toxoplasmosis may cause significant damage to the developing fetus and is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised persons. Serological investigation is unreliable, while isolation of the parasite is time consuming and may lack sensitivity. We have developed a system for detecting Toxoplasma gondii based on the amplification of the P30 gene using sequential rounds of PCR and nested primers. The clinical value of this technique was assessed by the investigation of a range of tissues taken from pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, AIDS patients and organ graft recipients. The PCR assay produced more positive reactions than isolation of the parasite by means of cell culture or animal inoculation. Extended autoradiography was found to be more sensitive than stained agarose gels for detecting the PCR product. Systematic contamination of PCR reactions was avoided but it was not possible to exclude sporadic contamination in certain cases. Detection of specific DNA is of clinical value in the investigation of the pregnant woman in order to assess the risk of transplacental passage of infection and in the fetus and neonate to identify congenital toxoplasmosis. Even so, PCR findings must be interpreted with caution because of the risk of a sample being contaminated. PCR may be the investigation of choice when brain biopsy is performed on a patient with AIDS and when toxoplasmosis associated with bone marrow transplantation is suspected.

7852576|a|PCR was used to evaluate the occurrence of Toxoplasma gondii parasitemia by detection of the B1 gene in blood samples in two groups of immunosuppressed patients (148 subjects) suspected of having cerebral or extracerebral infection, respectively. Group I consisted of 52 patients with AIDS with suspected cerebral toxoplasmosis. The diagnosis was clinically proven in 15 cases. Parasitemia was detected by PCR in only two of these patients (13.3%), both showing evidence of disseminated infection. Group II consisted of 96 immunocompromised patients, either with AIDS or receiving iatrogenic immunosuppressive therapy. Of these patients, 65 (34 with AIDS and 31 others) showed abnormalities only in chest radiography and were first screened for the presence of Toxoplasma DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Blood was then analyzed when the parasite was detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The remaining 31 subjects (22 with AIDS and 9 others) were suspected of having extracerebral, pulmonary, or disseminated toxoplasmosis, and blood was studied directly in these cases. Among the nine patients with clinically diagnosed extracerebral infection in group II, the parasite was detected by PCR in the blood of five patients (55.5%), all having pulmonary toxoplasmosis. If all patients with clinical manifestations of extracerebral toxoplasmosis (from both groups) who had not received antitoxoplasma therapy when the samples were collected are considered, PCR detected parasitemia in seven of the nine cases (77.8%). The present study indicates that examination of blood by PCR may be valuable in cases of extracerebral toxoplasmosis because of the disseminated nature of the disease. Since most cases of cerebral toxoplasmosis result from the local reactivation of latent brain cysts, detection of parasitemia by PCR is useful only in cases associated with severe cerebral infection or dissemination of this disease.

7544741|a|Toxoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The lung is a major site of infection after the central nervous system. The aim of the study was to assess the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cell culture for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii. One hundred and thirty two human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with respiratory manifestations, who underwent fibreoptic bronchoalveolar lavage, were investigated. Detection of Toxoplasma gondii was compared using three techniques: Giemsa staining; polymerase chain reaction with specific primers derived from the P30 gene; and culture on the MRC5 cell line. Toxoplasma gondii was detected in the same four samples by all three techniques. We conclude that PCR adds little to conventional (and cheaper) tools already used to diagnose pulmonary toxoplasmosis.

7888118|a|To study the accuracy of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Toxoplasma gondii DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AIDS patients for the diagnosis of T. gondii encephalitis.Eighty-two AIDS patients with brain lesions. At autopsy, 19 patients (group A) had toxoplasmic encephalitis and 33 (group B) primary brain lymphoma or other infections. Brain histology was not available for 30 patients; cerebral lesions improved after anti-Toxoplasma therapy in 16 (group C), but there was no improvement in 14 patients (group D).T. gondii RH strain was serially diluted in microplate wells. After heat denaturation, nested PCR was performed on diluted tachyzoites and on 10 microliters CSF with primers flanking the B1 repetitive region of T. gondii genome.DNA from one to five tachyzoites was detected in each experiment. PCR was positive in eight (42.1%) out of 19 group A samples, none of the group B samples, 10 (62.5%) out of 16 group C samples and none of the group D samples. Among group A and C patients, PCR was positive in all 11, and in seven out of 24 (29.1%; P < 0.04) patients who had received anti-Toxoplasma therapy for less or more than 1 week at the time of rachicentesis, respectively.Nested PCR for T. gondii in CSF may improve early differential diagnosis of AIDS-associated focal brain lesions. Higher diagnostic accuracy was achieved when lumbar puncture was performed in the first week of anti-Toxoplasma therapy.

8511517|a|Reactivation of Toxoplasma gondii can lead to a life-threatening intracerebral infection in immunocompromised HIV-positive patients. Due to the current diagnostic limitations for establishing an exact diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis, a nested PCR system was developed for direct detection of T. gondii in cerebrospinal fluid. A storage temperature for samples of -20 degrees C and sample preparation using Proteinase K appeared to be critical for obtaining a high sensitivity of PCR. A total of 56 samples from 38 HIV-positive patients and 12 HIV-negative patients with symptoms or signs of neurological disease were evaluated by PCR. 5 of the 38 HIV-positive patients were diagnosed as having cerebral toxoplasmosis and PCR was positive in samples from all 5 patients. In the remaining 33, PCR was positive in one case and negative in 32. An exact etiological diagnosis other than cerebral toxoplasmosis was established in 5 patients. PCR performed on cerebrospinal fluid samples seems to be a fast, sensitive, specific and valuable tool for establishing the diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis among HIV-positive patients at the time of presentation of symptoms or signs of neurological disease.

Pneumonia as the presenting feature of disseminated toxoplasmosis was confirmed by both clinical findings and by detection of Toxoplasma gondii DNA in blood obtained from two patients.

8507757|a|To investigate whether the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the BI gene of Toxoplasma gondii could contribute to the diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis in patients with AIDS, we retrospectively tested CSF samples from 20 patients with AIDS suspected of having cerebral toxoplasmosis for the presence of T. gondii. Suspicion of cerebral toxoplasmosis was based on accepted criteria. Nine patients with AIDS with IgG antibodies to T. gondii but who were not suspected of having cerebral toxoplasmosis and four patients with AIDS seronegative for T. gondii served as negative control patients. T. gondii was demonstrated by PCR in the CSF from 13 of the 20 patients with AIDS suspected of having cerebral toxoplasmosis but was not demonstrated in the CSF samples from the nine control patients seropositive for T. gondii and the four control patients seronegative for T. gondii. The data were statistically evaluated. This study shows the value of PCR for the detection of T. gondii in CSF for the diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis in patients with AIDS.

8483889|a|We investigated the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, using seven cases in which the diagnosis was certain based on histologic examination and eight cases in which histologic findings only suggested Toxoplasma gondii infection. After amplification the PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blotting with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. In six of seven proven cases of toxoplasmosis, organisms were detected using DNA extracted from 1/50 to 3/50 of a 6-microns tissue section. In addition, organisms were detected in one of eight cases in which infection was suspected, but not proven by identification of organisms. We conclude on the basis of this study that PCR may be useful for detection of T. gondii in a few cases in which routine histologic examination or immunoperoxidase staining is not definitive. Since PCR has 1000-fold higher sensitivity when applied to fresh, rather than paraffin-embedded, tissues, we expect PCR to be more sensitive in fresh tissue.

1939564|a|The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in congenitally infected children or in immunocompromised patients can be difficult; serology is not reliable, and the diagnosis must be based on the combination of symptomatology and the direct demonstration of the parasite in clinical specimens by microscopy, antigen detection, or inoculation of samples into mice or tissue cultures. These techniques are either insensitive or time-consuming. To determine the value of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infections, we compared this technique with conventional detection techniques, such as microscopy, tissue culturing, and mouse inoculation. We were able to detect T. gondii by PCR in clinical specimens and tissue samples that were obtained postmortem from a bone marrow recipient with cerebral toxoplasmosis and from three congenitally infected children. The presence of T. gondii was demonstrated in brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, the heart, and skeletal muscle tested fresh or after fixation in Formalin. In only one sample was T. gondii isolated by mouse inoculation but not detected by PCR. Because it is a sensitive, relatively rapid, and specific method and because it can be applied to a variety of different clinical samples, PCR can be considered a valuable additional tool for the identification of T. gondii infections.

We used a sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction methodology for the identification of toxoplasmic genomes previously reported by others to investigate whether this technology could contribute to the diagnosis. We were able to reliably detect toxoplasmic genomes in paraffin-embedded tissues of toxoplasmic encephalitis and myocarditis, and serial dilution studies indicated a high degree of sensitivity. Nonetheless, we identified toxoplasmic genomes in frozen tissue from only one of nine cases of toxoplasmic lymphadenitis. In the one positive case, only one of three frozen samples from the lymph node biopsy was positive, indicating a focal infection within the lymph node. It is concluded that polymerase chain reaction studies, at their current level of sensitivity, are not of great use in contributing to the evaluation of cases of suspected toxoplasmic lymphadenitis, which continues to be best diagnosed by accurate histopathologic examination.

2195038|a|Budding in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves a polarized deposition of new cell surface material that is associated with a highly asymmetric disposition of the actin cytoskeleton. Mutants defective in gene CDC24, which are unable to bud or establish cell polarity, have been of great interest with regard to both the mechanisms of cellular morphogenesis and the mechanisms that coordinate cell-cycle events. To gain further insights into these problems, we sought additional mutants with defects in budding. We report here that temperature-sensitive mutants defective in genes CDC42 and CDC43, like cdc24 mutants, fail to bud but continue growth at restrictive temperature, and thus arrest as large unbudded cells. Nearly all of the arrested cells appear to begin nuclear cycles (as judged by the occurrence of DNA replication and the formation and elongation of mitotic spindles), and many go on to complete nuclear division, supporting the hypothesis that the events associated with budding and those of the nuclear cycle represent two independent pathways within the cell cycle. The arrested mutant cells display delocalized cell-surface deposition associated with a loss of asymmetry of the actin cytoskeleton. CDC42 maps distal to the rDNA on chromosome XII and CDC43 maps near lys5 on chromosome VII.

7591071|a|The redistribution and capping of surface receptors on the human pathogen Entamoeba histolytica was observed in the presence of concanavalin A (ConA). Capping was correlated with plasma membrane folding towards the rear of the amoeba and with uroid formation. The uroid is thought to play a role in the escape of amoebae from the host immune response. To localize myosin II during capping, amoebae were incubated in the presence of ConA and then analyzed by microscopy. Myosin II was three times more concentrated within the uroid compared with the rest of the cell, suggesting that the release of caps may depend upon mechanical contraction driven by myosin II activity. The use of drugs that disrupt cytoskeletal structure or that inhibit myosin heavy chain phosphorylation demonstrated that inhibition of capping prevents uroid formation. Biochemical analysis allowed the identification of two ConA receptors which have been previously described as major pathogenic antigens of this parasite: the 96-kDa antigen, which carries alcohol dehydrogenase 2 activity and binds extracellular matrix proteins, and the Gal-GalNAc-inhibitable surface lectin, which is involved in amoeba-cell interactions and in the degradation of complement particles attached to the parasite.

7737114|a|A 78 residue antimicrobial, basic peptide, NK-lysin, with three intrachain disulfide bonds was purified from pig small intestine and characterized. A corresponding clone was isolated from a porcine bone marrow cDNA library. The 780 bp DNA sequence had a reading frame of 129 amino acids which corresponded to NK-lysin. The clone was used to show that stimulation with human interleukin-2 induced synthesis of NK-lysin-specific mRNA in a lymphocyte fraction enriched for T and NK cells. Lower levels of mRNA were detected in tissues known to contain T and NK cells, such as small intestine, spleen and colon. Interleukin-2 also induced both proliferation of the lymphocyte fraction and cytolytic function in these cells. Immunostaining showed that NK-lysin was present in cells positive for CD8, CD2 and CD4. NK-lysin showed high anti-bacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium and moderate activity against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The peptide showed a marked lytic activity against an NK-sensitive mouse tumour cell line, YAC-1, but it did not lyse red blood cells. The amino acid sequence of NK-lysin exhibits 33% identity with a putative human preproprotein, NKG5, of unknown function but derived from a cDNA clone of activated NK cells. We suggest that NK-lysin is a new effector molecule of cytotoxic T and NK cells.

8947549|a|Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) has been implicated in growth factor signal transduction and vesicular membrane traffic. It is thought to mediate the earliest steps leading from ligation of cell surface receptors to increased cell surface ruffling. We show here that inhibitors of PI 3-kinase inhibit endocytosis in macrophages, not by interfering with the initiation of the process but rather by preventing its completion. Consistent with earlier studies, the inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited fluid-phase pinocytosis and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, but they had little effect on the receptor-mediated endocytosis of diI-labeled, acetylated, low density lipoprotein. Large solute probes of endocytosis reported greater inhibition by wortmannin than smaller probes did, indicating that macropinocytosis was affected more than micropinocytosis. Since macropinocytosis and phagocytosis are actin-mediated processes, we expected that their inhibition by wortmannin resulted from deficient signaling from macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptors or Fc receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. However, video microscopy showed cell surface ruffling in wortmannin-treated cells, and increased ruffling after addition of M-CSF or phorbol myristate acetate. Quantitative measurements of video data reported slightly diminished ruffling in wortmannin-treated cells. Remarkably, the ruffles that formed in wortmannin-treated macrophages all receded into the cytoplasm without closing into macropinosomes. Similarly, wortmannin and LY294002 did not inhibit the extension of actin-rich pseudopodia along IgG-opsonized sheep erythrocytes, but instead prevented them from closing into phagosomes. These findings indicate that PI 3-kinase is not necessary for receptor-mediated stimulation of pseudopod extension, but rather functions in the closure of macropinosomes and phagosomes into intracellular organelles.

2862217|a|Within 5 s of challenge of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites with red blood cells (RBC), attachment and deformation of target cells occurred at multiple sites on the amoeba surface. Many trophozoite-target interfaces were outlined with a ring of polymerized amoeba actin, revealed by rhodamine-phalloidin staining of glutaraldehyde-fixed and Triton-X 100-extracted cells. The beginnings of phagocytic pseudopods rimmed many targets. The phagocytic membrane and underlying actin network grew uniformly about a target cell, which became dramatically elongated and constricted, sometimes severed, as it entered the amoeba. Total engulfment of RBC targets occurred within 10 s. By methanol extraction and spectrofluorimetric measurement of bound rhodamine-phalloidin we were able to quantitate polymerized actin in amoebae. Interaction with target cells was accompanied by a net increase of up to twofold in the average polymerized actin content of trophozoites. This reached a maximum during the period of most active phagocytosis (4 min after challenge at 25 degrees C), and declined as phagocytic activity diminished (8-16 min). Challenge with latex beads of similar size and number, which E. histolytica phagocytized more slowly than RBC, induced neither a detectable increase in polymerized actin content nor appearance of polymerized actin at the contact interface. RBC inhibited phagocytosis of latex beads, but the reverse did not occur. The results demonstrate a rapid, recognition-specific stimulation of reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of E. histolytica induced by binding to target cells. Vigorous phagocytic activity is frequently an immediate consequence of cell-cell contact, which emphasizes the importance of this process in the contact-mediated attack mechanism of this pathogen. The quantitative assay of polymerized actin may be useful in further studies of this mechanism.

In contrast, E1E2 ATPases--e.g., the K+-dependent (Kdp) ATPase from Escherichia coli, the Na+,K+-ATPase from ox brain, and the Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum--are moderately sensitive to this inhibitor. Finally, membrane ATPases from Neurospora vacuoles, chromaffin granules, and plant vacuoles are extremely sensitive. From this we conclude that bafilomycin A1 is a valuable tool for distinguishing among the three different types of ATPases and represents the first relatively specific potent inhibitor of vacuolar ATPases.

8930910|a|In order to identify molecules that might be responsible for the difference in pathogenicity between the two closely related protozoan parasites Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar, we focussed on cysteine proteinases because this class of enzymes has been considered important for pathogenic tissue destruction. By screening a genomic library derived from an E. histolytica isolate, a total of six distinct genes (ehcp1-ehcp6) encoding typical prepro-forms of cysteine proteinases were identified which differed from each other by 40% to 85% of their nucleotide sequences. Three of these genes, ehcp1, ehcp2, and ehcp5, which exhibited high levels of expression, were found to be responsible for approximately 90% of cysteine proteinase transcripts, whereas the remaining three were either not or only marginally expressed. Expression of the different genes directly correlated with the level of activity of the respective enzymes in trophozoite lysates. Purification of the enzymes and N-terminal sequencing revealed that virtually all cysteine proteinase activity of E. histolytica can be attributed to three enzymes namely EhCP1, EhCP2 and EhCP5. Southern blot analysis indicated that just two of these abundantly expressed genes are missing in E. dispar. On the other hand, genes analogous to four of the six genes identified in E. histolytica were found to be present in E. dispar, but only two of these are expressed within the trophozoite stage.

8294042|a|Cellular processes including proliferation, organization of the actin cytoskeleton, vesicular traffic and secretion of proteins comprising the lysosomal/endosomal system are regulated by low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily. However, to date only three Dictyostelium discoideum ras-like genes and two ypt-1/sec4-like genes have been identified and characterized. We report here the identification (using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe) of seven additional cDNAs coding for members highly related to the Rac proteins (Ras-related-C3 botulinum toxin substrate) which belong to the Rho (Ras homologous) family of GTPases. Three of these rac-related genes (rac1A, rac1B and rac1C) predict proteins with > 90% amino acid (aa) sequence identity with each other and > 80% identity to the human rac1 gene product, whereas the other members (racA, racB, racC and racD) predict proteins with 46-74% identity to the rac1 and rhoA gene products and to each other. The D. discoideum proteins were entirely conserved over the four regions known to be important for GTP binding and all contained the C-terminal CAAX aa motifs shared by other Rho proteins. Interestingly, the D. discoideum rac-related genes revealed unique patterns of expression during growth and development. For instance, the steady-state level of rac1 mRNA, encoded by three highly related genes, increased transiently during aggregation and then rapidly decreased. In contrast, the cellular abundance of mRNAs encoded by the other rac-like genes decreased at different rates and to different levels during development from the peak levels observed during growth. This suggests that the GTP-binding proteins encoded by these genes may play unique roles during the different stages of the D. discoideum life cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

7677998|a|A new member of the ras superfamily, designated CErac1 has been identified. The CErac1 cDNA clone was isolated from a Caenorhabditis elegans mixed stage library and encodes a protein of 191 amino acids with 82 and 79% identity to human rac1 and rac2 proteins, respectively. The CErac1 cDNA maps to a position on C. elegans chromosome IV in close proximity to cha-1, a choline acetyltransferase gene. The CErac1 cDNA hybridizes to two mRNAs (1.7 and 0.9 kilobases). Their expression is developmentally regulated, that of the more abundant 1.7 kilobases being highest at the embryonic stage and decreasing dramatically during development with 10% of the embryonic level in adult nematodes. The glutathione-S-transferase/CErac1 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli binds GTP and exhibits intrinsic GTPase activity. The GTPase activity of the CErac1 protein is stimulated by human n-chimaerin, a GTPase-activating protein for p21 rac1. These data suggest a role of CErac1 in C. elegans early development. The conserved biochemical properties indicate that further characterization of CErac1 by genetic analysis will be helpful in elucidating not only its role in the signal transduction, but also the biological function of its mammalian homologues.

8036496|a|Rho and Rac, two members of the Ras superfamily of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, regulate a variety of signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells. Upon stimulation of phagocytic cells, Rac enhances the activity of the enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH) oxidase, resulting in the production of superoxide radicals. Activation of the NADPH oxidase requires the assembly of a multimolecular complex at the plasma membrane consisting of two integral membrane proteins, gp91phox and p21phox, and two cytosolic proteins, p67phox and p47phox. Rac1 interacted directly with p67phox in a GTP-dependent manner. Modified forms of Rac with mutations in the effector site did not stimulate oxidase activity or bind to p67phox. Thus, p67phox appears to be the Rac effector protein in the NADPH oxidase complex.

The mutant cells also show resistance to 5 mM colchicine and 100 microM cytochalasin B, drugs proved deleterious for wild type trophozoites. The mutants show increased osmotic fragility and electric mobility but reduced phagocytic activity, and agglutination by Concanavalin A. On the other hand pinocytic activity remains unaltered when compared with the wild type cells. Polymerized actin, seen by staining with phalloidin, often appears polarized to one end of the trophozoites and forms few of the endocytic invaginations found in wild type amebas. An altered distribution of part of the actin could explain the differences in surface properties and motility observed in the mutant amebas.

8508172|a|Explaining the low incidence of invasive disease (10%) in humans infected with Entamoeba histolytica has occupied the attention of generations of both clinical and nonclinical investigators. One possible explanation would be the existence of two morphologically identical species-one an invasive pathogen, the other noninvasive. This was first proposed by Brumpt in 1925, but his explanation was virtually ignored until 1978 when the first of several publications appeared suggesting that E. histolytica did indeed consist of two species. We have reexamined Brumpt's claim in light of recent biochemical, immunological and genetic studies and conclude that the data derived from these investigations provide unequivocal evidence supporting his hypothesis. With this in mind, we redescribe the invasive parasite retaining the name Entamoeba histolytica Schaudinn, 1903 (Emended Walker, 1911), and set it apart from the noninvasive parasite described by Brumpt, Entamoeba dispar Brumpt, 1925.

To analyze the mechanism of capping in E. histolytica trophozoites, optimal conditions were determined for cap induction by sera from patients with amebic liver abscess, by polyclonal anti-amebic antibodies, and by concanavalin A. Cocapping of actin and myosin was documented by immunofluorescent staining of capped amebas using phalloidin, monoclonal anti-actin antibodies, and polyclonal anti-myosin antibodies. Immunoblots confirmed the presence of actin and myosin in isolated caps. These observations demonstrate that amebic cytoskeletal components participate in E. histolytica capping of surface receptors.

Proton-pump-mediated acidification of these organellar compartments is vital to numerous cell processes, including receptor recycling, protein processing and sorting and microbial degradation.

The present discussion will review the current knowledge regarding the presence of V-ATPases in both the plasmalemmal and organellar membranes of phagocytic cells, the regulation of proton pump activity in these locations and the functional significance of pump-mediated proton translocation.

2373188|a|Work from several laboratories suggests a correlation between expression of cysteine proteinase activity and the cytopathic effect of virulent HM1 strain Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites on cultured cell monolayers. Consistent with this relationship, we find that L-6 trophozoites, mutants cloned from the HM1 parent strain, are deficient in both proteinase expression and cytopathic effect. Three other clones, with proteinase expression equal to or greater than that of the HM1 strain, express the cytopathic effect. Furthermore, a nontoxic specific proteinase inhibitor, Z-phenylalanyl-alanyl-CH2F, inhibits the cytopathic effect of live trophozoites in a dose-dependent manner. These results support the hypothesis that expression and release of the cysteine proteinase is an important factor in producing the cytopathic effect, presumably by its degradation of cell anchoring proteins.

7541421|a|The receptors responsible for avid alveolar macrophage (AM) phagocytosis of unopsonized environmental particulates have not been well defined. This study used flow cytometry to quantitate the effects of a panel of soluble ligands for macrophage adhesion receptors on AM binding of unopsonized environmental dusts (titanium dioxide, TiO2; iron oxide, Fe2O3; alpha-quartz, SiO2; diesel engine exhaust dust) or fluorescent latex beads. Polyanionic ligands of the macrophage scavenger receptor (SR) for acetylated-LDL caused marked inhibition of AM binding of the oxide particles and latex beads (e.g., TiO2 binding; polyinosinic acid (polyl), 10 micrograms/ml: 70.2 +/- 1.5% inhibition, mean +/- SE, n = 11). In contrast, no inhibition was seen with the polyanions heparin and chondroitin sulfate (chond-S), or dextran, consistent with the known inhibitor profile of macrophage SRs for acetylated-LDL AM uptake of latex or SiO2 beads instilled into lungs of hamsters was inhibited by administration of polyl but not chondroitin sulfate (AM beads per cell: control, 6.1 +/- 0.7; polyl, 3.5 +/- 0.2; chond-S, 5.1 +/- 0.7, n > or = 4, p < 0.05 for control vs polyl) indicating macrophages SRs operate in vivo as well as in vitro. In contrast, AM binding of the carbonaceous diesel dust particles was not inhibited by any ligand tested. AM uptake of unopsonized TiO2, SR ligands or acetylated LDL caused no significant activation of AM respiratory burst or TNF production, consistent with past observations that opsonin-independent phagocytosis of inert particles by normal AMs is not accompanied by pro-inflammatory activation. These data implicate macrophage-type SRs in AM binding of charged environmental particles and indicate that distinct mechanisms mediate binding of carbonaceous dusts.

8910302|a|We have studied whether various agents that inhibit purified yeast and mammalian 26 S proteasome can suppress the breakdown of different classes of proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The degradation of short-lived proteins was inhibited reversibly by peptide aldehyde inhibitors of proteasomes, carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132) and carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norvalinal (MG115), in a yeast mutant with enhanced permeability, but not in wild-type strains. Lactacystin, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, had no effect, but the beta-lactone derivative of lactacystin, which directly reacts with proteasomes, inhibited the degradation of short-lived proteins. These inhibitors also blocked the rapid ubiquitin-dependent breakdown of a beta-galactosidase fusion protein and caused accumulation of enzymatically active molecules in cells. The degradation of the bulk of cell proteins, which are long-lived molecules, was not blocked by proteasome inhibitors, but could be blocked by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This agent, which inhibits multiple vacuolar proteases, did not affect the proteasome or breakdown of short-lived proteins. These two classes of inhibitors can thus be used to distinguish the cytosolic and vacuolar proteolytic pathways and to increase the cellular content of short-lived proteins.

The peptides H1 and H3, representing two highly amphipathic alpha-helical regions of amoebapore, possessed pore-forming activity. Peptide H3 displayed cytolytic and antibacterial functions similar to those of natural amoebapore.

2235060|a|Why do parasites kill their hosts? During this past decade, research in three different areas; evolutionary ecology, medical microbiology, and population genetics has provided theory and data that address this and related questions of selection and the evolution and maintenance of parasite virulence. A general theory of parasite-host coevolution and the conditions for selection to favour parasite virulence has been put forth. Considerable advances have been made in elucidating the mechanisms of pathogenicity and inheritance of virulence in bacteria. The population genetic structure and the relationship between pathogenic and non-pathogenic forms has been determined for a number of species of bacteria. We critically review these developments and their implications for questions of selection and the evolution and maintenance of virulence in bacteria. We postulate how selection may operate on specific types of bacterial virulence and present a general protocol to experimentally test hypotheses concerning selection and the evolution of virulence in bacteria.

2141984|a|Entamoeba histolytica is a primitive eukaryote that lacks mitochondria. Golgi and a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum. Close to half of the cell volume is occupied by pinocytic vesicles, which are in continuous turnover with the plasma membrane and perform functions that in higher eukaryotic cells are taken over by lysosomes. Similar to the latter, the amebal vesicles are acidified. We report here that bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type (V-) ATPases, suppressed this acidification at submicromolar concentrations; concomitantly, it inhibited pinocytosis. These results strongly suggest the presence of a V-ATPase in pinocytic vesicles of E. histolytica, and thereby support the notion that the V-ATPases in the organelles of higher eukaryotes are derived from an archaic plasma membrane-bound form.

8964500|a|Entamoeba histolytica (Eh), the parasite that causes amebic dysentery, is the only protozoan that phagocytoses bacteria, epithelial cells and red blood cells. Numerous low-molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, called p21rac, are implicated in signal transduction and actin polymerization during phagocytosis by macrophages and Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd). Here, molecular cloning techniques were used to obtain four Eh rac genes that encoded putative p21rac, as well as segments of two Eh rac pseudogenes. The predicted Eh p21rac, which share 55-81% amino acid (aa) identities with each other, include one that closely resembles the p21rac1 of man, Dd, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans; two that resemble the p21racC of Dd; and one that is unique. An alignment of the Eh rac ORF with other rac family proteins reveals multiple aa that distinguish p21rac1, p21racC and p21cdc42. We conclude that the Eh genes encoding amebic p21rac, which are the first identified from a protozoan parasite, are numerous and heterogeneous.

This lectin, which is composed of two subunits linked by disulfide bonds, has been shown to be a protective antigen in an animal model of amebiasis. We have determined the sequence of the mature form of the 170-kDa heavy subunit from cDNA clones and PCR-amplified fragments. The heavy subunit sequence consisted of a putative extracellular domain containing 1209 amino acids with 16 potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, a 26-amino acid hydrophobic region, and a 41-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. The presence of N-linked oligosaccharides was confirmed by culturing amebae with tunicamycin, which resulted in a decrease in the heavy subunit molecular mass to 160 kDa and a loss of lectin activity. The extracellular domain was remarkable for an extensive cysteine-rich domain that shared identify with similar regions of several other cell surface proteins and appeared to confer protease resistance to the subunit.

8944083|a|The pathogenesis of severe, Plasmodium falciparum malaria in African children is considered in the context of its two major clinical syndromes: malaria with respiratory distress; and malaria with neurological disturbance. Respiratory distress is an important prognostic marker in children with P. falciparum infections. In the majority of cases it reflects an underlying metabolic acidosis, usually associated with lactic acidaemia. Hypovolaemia and anaemia are important underlying factors. The syndrome of malaria with neurological impairment is not a homogenous condition. Four distinct groups of children fulfilling the WHO definition of cerebral malaria may be distinguished: (1) prolonged post-ictal state; (2) covert status epilepticus; (3) severe metabolic derangement (particularly hypoglycaemia and metabolic acidosis); and (4) children with a primary neurological syndrome. These distinctions are important from a therapeutic point of view, as well as for their implications for studies on underlying pathogenic factors. A simple framework is presented to summarize how three major processes, anaemia, the acute phase response and sequestration of infected cells, may interact to lead to reduced tissue oxygenation as a unifying process in the pathogenesis of both major clinical syndromes of severe malaria.

7521331|a|Wortmannin, a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (Okada, T., Sakuma, L., Fukui, Y., Hazeki, O., and Ui, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3563-3567), prevented Fc receptor for IgG (Fc gamma R)-dependent phagocytosis of the human monocytic cell line U937 or guinea pig neutrophils. Cross-linking of Fc gamma R on the surface of U937 cells increased PI 3-kinase activity that was immunoprecipitated with antibody against phosphotyrosine or antibody against the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. Specific cross-linking of Fc gamma R subclass Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII, using monoclonal antibodies against each receptor subclass and the F(ab')2 fragment of goat antibody against mouse IgG, increased anti-phosphotyrosine-precipitable PI 3-kinase activity. Treatment of cells with anti-Fc gamma RIII antibody plus the same F(ab')2 did not affect the activity, reflecting the lack of Fc gamma RIII in U937 cells. Fcy gamma R stimulation triggered prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, among which the 115-kDa peptide showed strong association with PI 3-kinase. Thus, Fc gamma R appears to be coupled functionally, via a tyrosine kinase, to PI 3-kinase, which may regulate the phagocytotic activity of the cells.

7536630|a|Rho and rac, two members of the ras-related superfamily of small GTPases, regulate the polymerization of actin to produce stress fibers and lamellipodia, respectively. We report here that cdc42, another member of the rho family, triggers the formation of a third type of actin-based structure found at the cell periphery, filopodia. In addition to stress fibers, rho controls the assembly of focal adhesion complexes. We now show that rac and cdc42 also stimulate the assembly of multimolecular focal complexes at the plasma membrane. These complexes, which are associated with lamellipodia and filopodia, contain vinculin, paxillin, and focal adhesion kinase, but are distinct from and formed independently of rho-induced focal adhesions. Activation of cdc42 in Swiss 3T3 cells leads to the sequential activation of rac and then rho, suggesting a molecular model for the coordinated control of cell motility by members of the rho family of GTPases.

2432267|a|Entamoeba histolytica kills mammalian target cells in a multi-step sequential process with separate adherence, cytolytic, and phagocytic events. In the studies reported here, we used fluorescein isothiocyanate linked to dextran to label the endocytic vesicles of the HM1 strain of E. histolytica and measure vesicle pH (5.1 +/- 0.2 by spectrofluorimetry). Concentrations of NH4Cl (1.0-10.0 mM) sufficient to increase vesicle pH to greater than or equal to 5.7 inhibited amebic killing of target Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as assayed by trypan blue staining, by the release of 3H-thymidine previously incorporated into CHO cell monolayers, and by the release of 111indium oxine from radiolabeled CHO cells. Similar effects were also observed with two other weak bases, primaquine and chloroquine (both 50 microM). In contrast, NH4Cl (10 mM) did not affect either the adherence or phagocytic events, as measured by amebic adherence to CHO cells at 4 degrees C and by the binding and ingestion of 3H-leucine-labeled bacteria. In the presence of NH4Cl and the carbohydrate ligand asialofetuin, there was no evidence of intracellular trapping of the amebic galactose-inhibitable lectin; inhibition of adherence by cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml for 3 h) suggested rapid turnover of the surface lectin. Prolonged exposure to NH4Cl for 48 h (which had no effect on amebic protein synthesis) or shorter exposure to cycloheximide (10 micrograms for 3 h) produced persistent inhibition of cytolysis. These results indicate that an uninterrupted acid pH in intracellular endocytic vesicles is necessary for the cytolysis of target cells by E. histolytica trophozoites.

2580787|a|We studied the adherence of [3H]thymidine-labeled axenic Entamoeba histolytica (strain HM1-IMSS) to in vitro preparations of rat and human colonic mucosa. Studies were performed with fixed or unfixed rat colonic mucosa, unfixed rat mucosa exposed to trypsin, unfixed rat submucosa, and fixed human colonic mucosa. Twenty percent of the amebae adhered to fixed rat colonic mucosa; adherence was specifically inhibited by N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc), galactose, and asialofetuin. The adherence of amebae to fixed human colonic mucosa was also GalNAc inhibitable. Greater adherence was found with unfixed rat colonic mucosa (40.9%) and was not GalNAc inhibitable unless the tissue was first exposed to trypsin. However, GalNAc did inhibit the adherence of amebae to unfixed rat submucosa. Glutaraldehyde fixation of amebae inactivates known amebic adhesion proteins; there was a markedly decreased adherence of fixed amebae to trypsin-exposed mucosa or fixed rat colonic mucosa. However, fixed or viable amebae had equal levels of adherence to unfixed rat colonic mucosa, suggesting the presence of a host adhesion protein that binds to receptors on amebae. Human (10%) and rabbit (5%) immune sera reduced the adherence of viable amebae to fixed rat colonic mucosa. We concluded that the GalNAc-inhibitable adhesion protein on the surface of E. histolytica trophozoites mediated adherence to fixed rat mucosa, fixed human colonic mucosa, trypsin-exposed unfixed rat mucosa, and unfixed rat submucosa. The surface of unfixed rat colonic mucosa contained a glutaraldehyde- and trypsin-sensitive host adhesion protein, perhaps in the overlying mucus blanket, which bound viable or fixed E. histolytica trophozoites.

1643658|a|The function of rac, a ras-related GTP-binding protein, was investigated in fibroblasts by microinjection. In confluent serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells, rac1 rapidly stimulated actin filament accumulation at the plasma membrane, forming membrane ruffles. Several growth factors and activated H-ras also induced membrane ruffling, and this response was prevented by a dominant inhibitory mutant rac protein, N17rac1. This suggests that endogenous rac proteins are required for growth factor-induced membrane ruffling. In addition to membrane ruffling, a later response to both rac1 microinjection and some growth factors was the formation of actin stress fibers, a process requiring endogenous rho proteins. Using N17rac1 we have shown that these growth factors act through rac to stimulate this rho-dependent response. We propose that rac and rho are essential components of signal transduction pathways linking growth factors to the organization of polymerized actin.

2872254|a|We have used chemical mutagenesis to isolate 10 independent phagocytosis-deficient mutants of Entamoeba histolytica from a highly virulent clone (strain HM1:IMSS). Phagocytosis-deficient mutants were characterized by several biologic properties related to amoebic pathogenic mechanisms: virulence, adhesion to red blood cells, cytopathic effect of live trophozoites on cell culture monolayers, ability of amoebic extracts to destroy cell culture monolayers, and growth in semisolid agar. All of these mutants were also deficient in in vivo virulence and in vitro cytopathic effect. Three were also deficient in adhesion, and the extracts of three others were unable to destroy cell culture monolayers. These findings suggest a strong correlation between phagocytosis and in vivo and in vitro cytopathogenicity. Both adherence of trophozoites to target cells and toxin activity of crude extracts of amoebae seem to be necessary factors for the expression of the virulence of this parasite. Traits responsible for growth in semisolid agar do not seem to be involved in virulence.

2124704|a|We have isolated cDNA clones from a human placental library that code for a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein originally designated Gp (also called G25K). This identification is based on comparisons with the available peptide sequences for the purified human Gp protein and the use of two highly specific anti-peptide antibodies. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein is very similar to those of various members of the ras superfamily of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, including the N-, Ki-, and Ha-ras proteins (30-35% identical), the rho proteins (approximately 50% identical), and the rac proteins (approximately 70% identical). The highest degree of sequence identity (80%) is found with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-division-cycle protein CDC42. The human placental gene, which we designate CDC42Hs, complements the cdc42-1 mutation in S. cerevisiae, which suggests that this GTP-binding protein is the human homolog of the yeast protein.

1849461|a|A novel method has been developed to allow cloning of protein targets for receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. By utilizing the carboxy-terminal tail of EGF receptor (EGFR) as a probe to screen lambda gt11 expression libraries, several EGFR-binding proteins have been cloned; two have been analyzed and contain unique SH2 and SH3 domains. One gene (GRB-1) has been fully sequenced, is expressed in various tissues and cell lines, and has a molecular mass of 85 kd. Interestingly, GRB-1 encodes the human counterpart of the PI3 kinase-associated protein p85. Advantages of this technique include the ease of cloning tyrosine kinase receptor targets present at low levels and the ability to identify proteins that are related in their capacity to bind activated receptors but contain no significant DNA sequence homology. This method, termed CORT (for cloning of receptor targets), offers a general approach for the identification and cloning of various receptor targets.

8707055|a|The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria is a novel fluorescent marker that has potential use in the study of bacterial pathogenicity. To explore some of the potential applications of GFP to the study of host-parasite interactions, we constructed two GFP expression vectors suitable for different facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens. The first expression vector was tested in the enteric pathogens, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and the second vector tested in Mycobacterium marinum (Mm). Both expression vectors were found to be stable and to direct high levels of GFP synthesis. Standard epifluorescence microscopy was used to detect all three bacterial pathogenic species during the early and late stages of infection of live mammalian cells. Mm expressing gfp was also visualized in infected animal tissues. gfp expression did not adversely affect bacterial survival, nor did it compromise entry into mammalian cells or their survival within macrophages. In addition, all three gfp-expressing bacterial pathogens could be detected and sorted in a flow cytometer, either alone or in association with epithelial cells or macrophages. Therefore, GFP not only provides a convenient tool to image pathogenic bacteria, but allows the quantitative measurement of bacterial association with mammalian cells.

6204768|a|The immunogenic and antigenic determinants of a synthetic peptide and the corresponding antigenic determinants in the parent protein have been elucidated. Four determinants have been defined by reactivity of a large panel of antipeptide monoclonal antibodies with short, overlapping peptides (7-28 amino acids), the immunizing peptide (36 amino acids), and the intact parent protein (the influenza virus hemagglutinin, HA). The majority of the antipeptide antibodies that also react strongly with the intact protein recognize one specific nine amino acid sequence. This immunodominant peptide determinant is located in the subunit interface in the HA trimeric structure. The relative inaccessibility of this site implies that antibody binding to the protein is to a more unfolded HA conformation. This antigenic determinant differs from those previously described for the hemagglutinin and clearly demonstrates the ability of synthetic peptides to generate antibodies that interact with regions of the protein not immunogenic or generally accessible when the protein is the immunogen.

8657148|a|Wortmannin at nanomolar concentrations is a potent and specific inhibitor of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase and has been used extensively to demonstrate the role of this enzyme in diverse signal transduction processes. At higher concentrations, wortmannin inhibits the ataxia telangiectasia gene (ATM)-related DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). We report here the identification of the site of interaction of wortmannin on the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, p110alpha. At physiological pH (6.5 to 8) wortmannin reacted specifically with p110alpha. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate, ATP, and ATP analogs [adenine and 5'-(4-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl)adenine] competed effectively with wortmannin, while substances containing nucleophilic amino acid side chain functions had no effect at the same concentrations. This suggests that the wortmannin target site is localized in proximity to the substrate-binding site and that residues involved in wortmannin binding have an increased nucleophilicity because of their protein environment. Proteolytic fragments of wortmannin-treated, recombinant p110alpha were mapped with anti-wortmannin and anti-p110alpha peptide antibodies, thus limiting the target site within a 10-kDa fragment, colocalizing with the ATP-binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of all candidate residues within this region showed that only the conservative Lys-802-to-Arg mutation abolished wortmannin binding. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase occurs, therefore, by the formation of an enamine following the attack of Lys-802 on the furan ring (at C-20) of wortmannin. The Lys-802-to-Arg mutant was also unable to bind FSBA and was catalytically inactive in lipid and protein kinase assays, indicating a crucial role for Lys-802 in the phosphotransfer reaction. In contrast, an Arg-916-to-Pro mutation abolished the catalytic activity whereas covalent wortmannin binding remained intact. Our results provide the basis for the design of novel and specific inhibitors of an enzyme family, including PI kinases and ATM-related genes, that play a central role in many physiological processes.

1974952|a|Therapy-related myeloid neoplasia developed 14 to 189 months after diagnosis of the primary malignancy in 12 out of 3365 children treated for malignant solid tumours; 6 of the 12 were in their first complete remission. The 10-year cumulative incidence of myeloid neoplasia was 1.3% (95% Cl 0.5-3.6) for the 447 patients with Hodgkin's disease, 1.3% (0.4-4.3) for the 420 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 1.2% (0.3-5.2) for the 440 with neuroblastoma. This complication appeared in 1 of 180 children with brain tumours and in none of the 1878 with other malignancies. Risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasia in patients with Hodgkin's disease was associated with recurrence of the primary malignancy, a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents, and age greater than or equal to 12 years at diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. Of the 8 patients who underwent chromosomal analysis of neoplastic myeloid cells, 2 showed complete loss of chromosome 7 and 4 showed t(9;11) or t(8;21) with or without del(16)(q22).

1944468|a|Treatment of cancer with the epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide and teniposide) has been linked to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in children and adults, but the factors that might influence the risk of this complication of therapy are poorly defined. We therefore assessed the importance of potential risk factors for secondary AML in 734 consecutive children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who attained complete remission and received continuation (maintenance) treatment according to different schedules of epipodophyllotoxin administration.Secondary AML was diagnosed in 21 of the 734 patients, in 17 of whom this complication was the initial adverse event. Prolonged administration of epipodophyllotoxin (teniposide with or without etoposide) twice weekly or weekly was independently associated with the development of secondary AML (P less than 0.01 by Cox regression analysis). The overall cumulative risk of AML at six years was 3.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 percent to 6.1 percent); but within the subgroups treated twice weekly or weekly, the risks were 12.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.7 percent to 25.4 percent) and 12.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.1 percent to 24.4 percent), respectively. In the subgroups not treated with epipodophyllotoxins or treated with them only during remission induction or every two weeks during continuation treatment, the highest cumulative risk was 1.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 percent to 6.1 percent). After adjustment for treatment frequency, there was no apparent relation between the total dose of epipodophyllotoxins and the development of secondary AML. The relative hazard of etoposide as compared with teniposide could not be determined.The risk of epipodophyllotoxin-related AML depends largely on the schedule of drug administration. Other factors, including the cumulative dose of epipodophyllotoxin, radiotherapy, and the initial biologic features of the leukemic blast cells, do not appear to have critical roles.

8426196|a|To describe the occurrence of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with etoposide (VP-16).Two hundred five consecutive children with early B-lineage ALL were treated according to the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) protocol between January 1986 and July 1, 1991. Therapy included a four-drug induction followed by consolidation and continuation phases of nightly oral mercaptopurine (6-MP) and repetitive courses of divided-dose oral methotrexate (dMTX) and asparaginase (L-asp). Three doses of VP-16 and cytarabine (Ara-C) were given during consolidation and later, during continuation, two doses were given 3 to 4 days apart, every 9 weeks. Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy was given throughout the treatment period.Two hundred three of the 205 patients entered remission. Only eight of these 203 children have had a bone marrow relapse (ALL). However, 10 other children have developed secondary AML 23 to 68 months following the diagnosis of ALL. Overall event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years is 79.3% +/- 5.1%, with a risk of secondary AML at 4 years of 5.9% +/- 3.2%.This experience provides strong evidence for a link between epipodophyllotoxin therapy and secondary AML since none of these children received alkylating agent therapy or irradiation. This serious complication raises concern as to the appropriate use of epipodophyllotoxins in the treatment of childhood ALL.

8634439|a|A major unresolved question for 11q23 translocations involving MLL is the chromosomal mechanism(s) leading to these translocations. We have mapped breakpoints within the 8.3-kb BamHI breakpoint cluster region in 31 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) de novo and in 8 t-AML patients. In 23 of 31 leukemia de novo patients, MLL breakpoints mapped to the centromeric half (4.57 kb) of the breakpoint cluster region, whereas those in eight de novo patients mapped to the telomeric half (3.87 kb). In contrast, only two t-AML breakpoints mapped in the centromeric half, whereas six mapped in the telomeric half. The difference in distribution of the leukemia de novo breakpoints is statistically significant (P = .02). A similar difference in distribution of breakpoints between de novo patients and t-AML patients has been reported by others. We identified a low- or weak-affinity scaffold attachment region (SAR) mapping just centromeric to the breakpoint cluster region, and a high-affinity SAR mapping within the telomeric half of the breakpoint cluster region. Using high stringency criteria to define in vitro vertebrate topoisomerase II (topo II) consensus sites, one topo II site mapped adjacent to the telomeric SAR, whereas six mapped within the SAR. Therefore, 74% of leukemia de novo and 25% of t-AML breakpoints map to the centromeric half of the breakpoint cluster region map between the two SARs; in contrast, 26% of the leukemia de novo and 75% of the t-AML patient breakpoints map to the telomeric half of the breakpoint cluster region that contains both the telomeric SAR and the topo II sites. Thus, the chromatin structure of the MLL breakpoint cluster region may be important in determining the distribution of the breakpoints. The data suggest that the mechanism(s) leading to translocations may differ in leukemia de novo and in t-AML.

8319201|a|Translocations at chromosomal band 11q23 characterize most de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) of infants, acute myeloid leukemias (AML) of infants and young children, and secondary AMLs following epipodophyllotoxin exposure. The chromosomal breakpoints at 11q23 have been cloned from isolated cases of de novo ALL and AML. Using an 859-base pair BamHI fragment of human ALL-1 complementary DNA that recognizes the genomic breakpoint region for de novo ALL and AML, we investigated two cases of secondary AML that followed etoposide-treated primary B-lineage ALL. In the first case, the translocation occurred between chromosomes 9 and 11 and the breakpoint at 11q23 localized to the same 9-kilobase region of the ALL-1 gene that is disrupted in most of the de novo leukemias. In the second case the translocation was between chromosomes 11 and 19. The breakpoint occurred outside of the ALL-1 breakpoint cluster region.

7756657|a|We examined clinical, morphologic, and cytogenetic features and ALL-1 (MLL, Htrxl, HRX) gene rearrangements in 17 cases of secondary leukemia that occurred 11 months to 9 years from diagnoses of primary cancers in children who received topoisomerase II inhibitors or developed secondary leukemias typical of those associated with this therapy. Primary diagnoses included nine solid tumors and eight leukemias. Ten secondary leukemias were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one was of mixed lineage, two were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and four presented as myelodysplasia. Of 15 cases with 11q23 involvement, 11 (73%) were cytogenetically identifiable; four cases had molecular rearrangement only. By Southern blot, rearrangements within the ALL-1 gene were similar to sporadic cases. The results of this analysis suggest the following: (1) In most pediatric cases of topoisomerase II inhibitor-associated leukemia, there is disruption of the breakpoint cluster region of the ALL-1 gene at chromosomal band 11q23. (2) Exposure histories vary in secondary 11q23 leukemia, as the only topoisomerase II inhibitor was dactinomycin in one case, and, in another case, no topoisomerase II inhibitor was administered. (3) There is clinical, morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular heterogeneity in pediatric secondary 11q23 leukemia. (4) There are some survivors of pediatric secondary 11q23 leukemia, but the outcome is most often fatal.

The risk increases with cumulative dose and with the age of the patient. Most cases of MDS and AML following therapy with alkylating agents present chromosome aberrations, primarily loss of whole chromosomes No. 5 and/or No. 7 or various parts of the long arms of these chromosomes. The risk of MDS and AML following high-voltage radiotherapy is much lower. Recently an increased risk of AML has been demonstrated following therapy with the epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide.

7671237|a|Human leukemias with 11q23 translocations occur sporadically and after cancer treatment with DNA topoisomerase II-targeted drugs. To investigate this process, we examined DNA topoisomerase II cleavage in vitro in subclones of the normal 11q23 genomic homologue and a t(9;11) translocation breakpoint junction. Cleavage was assayed with limiting dilutions of enzyme in the presence or absence of epipodophyllotoxin and ATP. The strongest sites of cleavage coincided with the t(9;11) breakpoint site and two other translocation breakpoint sites within the normal homologue. These results support the involvement of DNA topoisomerase II in the translocation process at chromosome band 11q23.

8016145|a|The ALL-1 gene, located on chromosome band 11q23, is fused to a variety of other genes by reciprocal chromosomal translocations present in 5-10% of human acute leukemias. We have recently reported the detection by Southern blot of ALL-1 gene rearrangements in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia lacking cytogenetic evidence of 11q23 translocations. These include 2 of 19 patients with normal karyotypes as well as 3 of 4 patients with trisomy 11. To characterize the abnormal ALL-1 genes, we cloned the ALL-1 rearrangements from two patients with trisomy 11. Characterization of the clones, together with Southern blot analysis, indicates that the ALL-1 rearrangement in both patients is the result of a direct tandem duplication of a portion of the ALL-1 gene spanning exons 2-6. The partial ALL-1 duplication is also detected by Southern blot analysis in a patient with a normal karyotype. RNA PCR and DNA sequence analysis show that the partially duplicated ALL-1 gene is transcribed into mRNA capable of encoding a partially duplicated protein. Partial duplication of ALL-1, in which a portion of a putative protooncogene is fused with itself, represents an additional genetic mechanism for leukemogenesis. Our findings suggest that the presence of trisomy in malignancy may sometimes indicate the partial duplication of a cellular protooncogene.

8044771|a|Rearrangements of the ALL-1 gene by reciprocal translocations involving chromosome band 11q23 are frequently associated with human acute leukemia. We have previously reported the detection of ALL-1 gene rearrangements in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia lacking cytogenetic evidence of 11q23 translocations. These included 2 of 19 patients with normal karyotypes as well as 3 of 4 patients with trisomy 11 as a sole cytogenetic abnormality. Rearrangement of the ALL-1 genes in two of the patients with trisomy 11 was shown to result from a direct tandem duplication of a portion of the gene spanning exons 2-6. Here we report the characterization of the ALL-1 gene rearrangement in one of the previously reported acute myeloid leukemia patients with a normal karyotype. ALL-1 rearrangement in this patient results from a direct tandem duplication of a portion of the gene spanning exons 2-8. RNA polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence analysis show that the partially duplicated ALL-1 gene is transcribed into mRNA capable of encoding a partially duplicated protein. Sequence analysis of the genomic fusion region provides evidence for Alu-mediated homologous recombination as a mechanism for partial duplication of the ALL-1 gene.

8640834|a|Gains of a single chromosome are frequent cytogenic findings in human cancer, but no molecular rearrangement has been consistently associated with any trisomy. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), trisomy 11 (+11) occurring as a sole abnormality is the third most common trisomy. We have shown that the ALL1 gene, located at 11q23, can be rearranged as a result of a partial tandem duplication in two such cases of AML. To test the hypothesis that the partial tandem duplication of ALL1 is the recurrent molecular defect in cases of AML presenting with +11 as a sole cytogenic abnormality, we performed Southern analysis and PCR for defects of ALL1 in 17 cases of AML and one case of myelodysplastic syndrome with +11 or +11q but without cytogenic evidence of a structural abnormality involving 11q23. Twelve cases (67%) had rearrangement of ALL1, including 10 of 11 patients (91%) with +11 as a sole abnormality and 2 of 7 cases (29%) with +11 and other aberrations; all were classified as FAB M1 or M2. In 10 of the 12 cases, material was available for additional characterization; a partial tandem duplication of ALL1 was detected in each of these 10 cases (100%). Four cases demonstrated previously unreported duplications, two of which were detectable only by reverse transcription-PCR. Four patients with the ALL1 duplication also displayed a loss of material from 7q, suggesting an association between these two findings. We conclude that the partial tandem duplication of ALL1 is present in most, if not all, cases of AML with +11 as a sole abnormality, and can be found in cases of AML with +11 or +11q accompanied by other cytogenic abnormalities. The duplication is more prevalent in AML than was recognized previously in part because its size and location vary considerably, requiring a variety of molecular probes for detection. Our finding of the ALL1 duplication as a consistent defect in patients with +11 represents the first identification of a specific gene rearrangement associated with recurrent trisomy in human cancer.

9108076|a|The molecular defects responsible for tumorigenesis in adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a normal karyotype or an additional copy of one chromosome (i.e., trisomy) remain largely unknown. We recently discovered that approximately 90% of adult patients with de novo AML and trisomy 11 (+11) as a sole abnormality and 11% of adult patients with de novo AML and normal cytogenetics carry a molecular rearrangement of the ALL1 (MLL, HRX, or HTRX) gene. The rearranged ALL1 gene has been shown to result from the direct tandem duplication of a portion of ALL1 itself. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis, we asked whether in cytogenetically normal cases one or both chromosomes carry the mutated allele and whether in trisomic cases the mutation is present in one, two, or three chromosomes. Herein we show that in cytogenetically normal cases of AML and in cases with +11 as a sole cytogenetic abnormality, only one chromosome contains the mutated ALL1 allele. Thus a single mutated ALL1 allele with the partial tandem duplication is sufficient for ALL1-associated leukemogenesis, irrespective of the number of normal genes present. The frequently occurring specific association of +11 and ALL1 gene mutation in the leukemic clone remains unexplained.

8988051|a|Fifty-six patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia M4/M5 subtypes were studied for rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukemia gene, MLL (also called HRX, Htrx-1, or ALL-1). Ten patients (18%) showed rearrangements of the MLL gene, 9 in a major breakpoint cluster region within a centromeric 8.3-kb BamHI fragment, whereas rearrangement in one patient was the result of a direct tandem duplication of exons 2-6 of MLL. Analysis of sequences at the duplication junction revealed that the points of MLL fusion within introns 6 and 1 both lie within Alu elements. This suggests the involvement of Alu repeat mediated homologous recombination in MLL self fusion. For the 10 rearranged samples, cytogenetics analysis revealed a normal karyotype in 3, and 3 had abnormalities other than 11q23. Survival analysis of patients revealed no difference between those with rearrangement of MLL and those showing the germ-line configuration.

8656671|a|Rearrangement of the MLL (myeloid-lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia) gene through a reciprocal chromosomal translocation is found in 5% of adult acute myeloid (AML) and 10% of pediatric acute lymphoid (ALL) leukemia. More than 25 different reciprocal chromosomal translocations, with an 11q23 breakpoint, fuse the MLL gene (also named ALL-1, HRX and Htrx1) to a second partner gene. These leukemias have poor prognosis and frequently have a monocytic, lymphoid or biphenotypic (myeloid and lymphoid) antigen expression in blast cells. Approximately 20-30% of patients diagnosed as having adult de novo, AML have normal chromosomes by metaphase analysis and the majority of these patients have good prognosis. With the use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique and Southern blot analysis, we found that seven of 34 such patients (21%) had a tandem partial duplication of exons 2 to 6 or 2 to 8 of the MLL gene. These seven patients showed a median survival of 2.7 months, compared to a 6.8 months median survival for all other patients in the study. If confirmed on a large series of patients, our findings may help differentiate AML with normal karyotype and poor prognosis from those with normal karyotype and a more favorable prognosis.

9136917|a|Trisomy 11 as a sole chromosomal abnormality is a rare aberration observed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Recently a partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene, located on chromosome band 11q23, has been identified in de novo AML with trisomy 11. We describe a 72-year-old woman suffering from MDS-derived overt leukemia with trisomy 11 and a tandem duplication of the MLL gene. At first the patient was found to have myeloblasts with Auer rods in the peripheral blood and diagnosed as MDS, refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T). After 2 months a picture of overt leukemia (AML; M2) developed as shown by an increased number of myeloblasts. Various chemotherapy regimens had little effect, and she died of disease progression 15 months after admission. During her clinical course, the chromosome analyses consistently showed 47,XX, +11. Southern blot analysis of leukemic blasts on admission and in accelerated phase revealed identical rearranged bands of the MLL gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis excluded the possibility of masked translocation of the MLL gene to other chromosomes. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using a forward exon 6 primer and a backward exon 3 primer demonstrated an in-frame fusion of exon 8 with exon 2. Our results indicated that a partial tandem duplication of exons 2-8 of the MLL gene could be observed in MDS-derived overt leukemia as well as de novo AML with trisomy 11.

8946930|a|We analyzed mRNA expression of the flt3 gene in 30 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 50 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), expression of flt3 was observed in 61 patients; 22 (73%) with AML and 39 (78%) with ALL. Among these, five patients with AML (one M2, two M4, and two M5) showed unexpected longer transcripts with a primer combination which could amplify the transmembrane (TM) domain through the juxtamembrane (JM) domain. For those patients who expressed flt3 mRNA, the extracellular domain of the flt3 gene was also examined by RT-PCR, but no length abnormality was seen in this region. We further analyzed the TM domain through the second tyrosine kinase domain by genomic amplifications. The five patients who showed aberrant flt3 transcripts exhibited abnormal longer PCR products in addition to the germline products at a region corresponding to the JM through the first TK (TK1) domains. Sequence analyses of the abnormal RT-PCR products demonstrated that partial sequences were tandemly duplicated. Because all these altered transcripts were in-frame, deduced protein products could be expected. Sequence analyses of the genomic DNA revealed that three of the five patients showed a simple internal duplication within exon 11; one had an internal duplication (26 bp) with a 4-bp insertion; and in the fifth patient, a 136-bp sequence from the 3' part of exon 11 to intron 11 and the first 16-bp sequence of exon 12 were each duplicated with 1-bp insertion. In order to confirm the tumor specificity of these alterations, DNA samples obtained at complete remission were also analyzed in the three patients harboring an flt3 duplication, but no abnormal PCR product other than germline was detected in any of the samples. Our results suggest that an internal tandem duplication at the JM/TK1 domains of the flt3 gene is a somatic change detected preferentially in AML, possibly containing a monocytic component.

1423625|a|The ALL-1 gene located at human chromosome 11 band q23 is rearranged in acute leukemias with interstitial deletions or reciprocal translocations between this region and chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, or 19. The gene spans approximately 100 kb of DNA and contains at least 21 exons. It encodes a protein of more than 3910 amino acids containing three regions with homology to sequences within the Drosophila trithorax gene, including cysteine-rich regions that can be folded into six zinc finger-like domains. The breakpoint cluster region within ALL-1 spans 8 kb and encompasses several small exons, most of which begin in the same phase of the open reading frame. The t(4;11) chromosome translocation results in two reciprocal fusion products coding for chimeric proteins derived from ALL-1 and from a gene on chromosome 4. This suggests that each 11q23 abnormality gives rise to a specific oncogenic fusion protein.

2307988|a|Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes were examined in the lymphoblasts of 70 children with immunophenotypically defined B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The most frequent genes to rearrange were Ig heavy (H) chain (93%) and TCR delta (79%), followed by TCR gamma (49%), Ig kappa and/or lambda light (L) chain (46%), TCR alpha (46%), and TCR beta (29%). Thus, despite their putative "B-cell precursor" lineage, these leukemias manifest a remarkably high incidence of TCR gene rearrangements. While certain patterns predominate, there is considerable heterogeneity in Ig and TCR genotypes in this disease. No significant associations were found between Ig and TCR genotype and commonly used prognostic factors including age, sex, race, WBC, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, or cytogenetics. However, the lymphoblasts of three of six patients who failed to achieve initial remission had germline patterns of every Ig and TCR gene, a genotype not observed in the leukemic cells from any of the 64 patients who achieved complete remission (p2 = .0007). This study suggests that particular Ig and TCR genotypes may be of clinical relevance in childhood B-cell precursor ALL. The finding of rearranged TCR genes in a large proportion of cases raises fundamental questions about early lineage commitment and lymphocyte differentiation along B-cell and T-cell pathways.

Analysis of 322 random cDNAs indicates that the map covers the vast majority of the human genome.

These translocations fuse the ALL-1 gene, homolog of Drosophila trithorax and located at chromosome band 11q23, to genes from a variety of chromosomes. We cloned and sequenced cDNAs derived from transcripts of the AF-4 and AF-9 genes involved in the most common chromosome abnormalities, t(4:11)(q21:q23) and t(9:11)(p22:q23), respectively. Sequence analysis indicates high homology between the AF-9 gene protein product and the protein encoded by the ENL gene fused to ALL-1 in (11:19) chromosome translocations. AF-4, AF-9, and ENL proteins contain nuclear targeting sequences as well as serine-rich and proline-rich regions. Stretches abundant in basic amino acids are also present in the three proteins.

8260707|a|Chromosome band 11q23 is frequently involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) de novo, as well as in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and lymphoma. Five percent to 15% of patients treated with chemotherapy for a primary neoplasm develop therapy-related AML (t-AML) that may show rearrangements, usually translocations involving band 11q23 or, less often, 21q22. These leukemias develop after a relatively short latent period and often follow the use of drugs that inhibit the activity of DNA-topoisomerase II (topo II). We previously identified a gene, MLL (myeloid-lymphoid leukemia or mixed-lineage leukemia), at 11q23 that is involved in the de novo leukemias. We have studied 17 patients with t-MDS/t-AML, 12 of whom had cytogenetically detectable 11q23 rearrangements. Ten of the 12 t-AML patients had received topo II inhibitors and 9 of these, all with balanced translocations of 11q23, had MLL rearrangements on Southern blot analysis. None of the patients who had not received topo II inhibitors showed an MLL rearrangement. Of the 5 patients lacking 11q23 rearrangements, some of whom had monoblastic features, none had an MLL rearrangement, although 4 had received topo II inhibitors. Our study indicates that the MLL gene rearrangements are similar both in AML that develops de novo and in t-AML. The association of exposure to topo II-reactive chemotherapy with 11q23 rearrangements involving the MLL gene in t-AML suggests that topo II may play a role in the aberrant recombination events that occur in this region both in AML de novo and in t-AML.

8620491|a|The ALL1 gene is found rearranged in approximately 10% of acute lymphoblastic leukemias and in over 5% of acute myeloid leukemias. The gene undergoes fusion with either a variety of partner genes located on different chromosomes or with itself. To further characterize the role of the ALL1 gene in the leukemogenic process, and possibly in solid malignancies, we defined its complete genomic structure. The gene, which spans a region on chromosome band 11q23 approximately 90 kb in length, consists of 36 exons, ranging in size from 65 bp to 4249 bp. The determination of intronic sequences flanking the exon boundaries will allow the determination of whether point mutations may be responsible for inactivation of the gene in solid tumors showing loss of heterozygosity at region 11q23.

2194094|a|The linkage map of Escherichia coli K-12 depicts the arrangement of genes on the circular chromosome of this organism. The basic units of the map are minutes, determined by the time-of-entry of markers from Hfr into F- strains in interrupted-conjugation experiments. The time-of-entry distances have been refined over the years by determination of the frequency of cotransduction of loci in transduction experiments utilizing bacteriophage P1, which transduces segments of DNA approximately 2 min in length. In recent years, the relative positions of many genes have been determined even more precisely by physical techniques, including the mapping of restriction fragments and the sequencing of many small regions of the chromosome. On the whole, the agreement between results obtained by genetic and physical methods has been remarkably good considering the different levels of accuracy to be expected of the methods used. There are now few regions of the map whose length is still in some doubt. In some regions, genetic experiments utilizing different mutant strains give different map distances. In other regions, the genetic markers available have not been close enough to give accurate cotransduction data. The chromosome is now known to contain several inserted elements apparently derived from lambdoid phages and other sources. The nature of the region in which the termination of replication of the chromosome occurs is now known to be much more complex than the picture given in the previous map. The present map is based upon the published literature through June of 1988. There are now 1,403 loci placed on the linkage group, which may represent between one-third and one-half of the genes in this organism.

2849208|a|Paralyzed motors of motA and motB point and deletion mutants of Escherichia coli were repaired by synthesis of wild-type protein. As found earlier with a point mutant of motB, torque was restored in a series of equally spaced steps. The size of the steps was the same for both MotA and MotB. Motors with one torque generator spent more time spinning counterclockwise than did motors with two or more generators. In deletion mutants, stepwise decreases in torque, rare in point mutants, were common. Several cells stopped accelerating after eight steps, suggesting that the maximum complement of torque generators is eight. Each generator appears to contain both MotA and MotB.

2154333|a|A number of mutants of motA, a gene necessary for flagellar rotation in E. coli, were isolated and characterized. Many mutations were dominant, owing to competition between functional and nonfunctional MotA for a limited number of sites on the flagellar motor. A new class of mutant was discovered in which flagellar torque is normal at low speeds but reduced at high speeds. Hydrogen isotope effects on these mutants indicate that MotA catalyzes proton transfer. We confirmed an earlier observation that overproduction of MotA leads to accumulation of the protein in the cytoplasmic membrane and to significant decreases in growth rate. When nonfunctional mutant variants of MotA were overproduced instead, they accumulated in the cytoplasmic membrane, but growth was not impaired. These results also suggest that MotA conducts protons. This was confirmed by measuring the proton permeabilities of vesicles containing wild-type or mutant MotA proteins.

1719217|a|The MotA protein of Escherichia coli is an essential component of the torque-generating units that drive the flagellar rotary motor. A variety of evidence indicates that MotA is involved in transmembrane proton conduction. We have now mapped a number of MotA mutants, focusing primarily on those previously shown to be dominant. Fifty-six mutations (all dominant), each causing severe or complete impairment of function, were sequenced and found to correspond to 31 different alleles. All except two of these encoded amino acid substitutions clustered in four hydrophobic, presumably membrane-spanning segments, that together make up only one-third of the length of the polypeptide chain. In contrast, eight mutations (5 dominant), each causing only slight impairment of function (slow alleles), were sequenced and found to specify amino acid substitutions in three hydrophilic domains. The clustering of the mutations provides independent support for the suggestion that MotA is a transmembrane proton channel and places significant constraints on models for the molecular mechanism of ion conduction.

2061285|a|The MotB protein of Escherichia coli is an essential component in each of eight torque generators in the flagellar rotary motor. Based on its membrane topology, it has been suggested that MotB might be a linker that fastens the torque-generating machinery to the cell wall. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a number of motB mutants. As found previously for motA, many alleles of motB were dominant, as expected if MotB is a component of the motor. In other respects, however, the motB mutants differed from the motA mutants. Most of the mutations mapped to a hydrophilic, periplasmic domain of the protein, and nothing comparable to the slow-swimming alleles of motA, which show normal torque when tethered, was found. Some motB mutants retained partial function, but when tethered they produced subnormal torque, indicating that their motors contained only one or two functional torque generators. These results support the hypothesis that MotB is a linker.

2447650|a|The MotB protein of Escherichia coli is an essential component of the force generators that couple proton movement across the cytoplasmic membrane to rotation of the flagellar motors. The membrane topology of MotB was examined to explore the possibility that it might form a proton channel. MotB--alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins were constructed to identify likely periplasmic domains of the MotB molecule. Fusions distal to a putative membrane-spanning segment near the amino terminus of MotB exhibited alkaline phosphatase activity, indicating that an extensive carboxyl-terminal portion of MotB may be located on the periplasmic side of the membrane. Protease treatment of MotB in spheroplasts confirmed this view. The simple transmembrane organization of MotB is difficult to reconcile with a role as a proton conductor.

6090403|a|The motA and motB gene products of Escherichia coli are integral membrane proteins necessary for flagellar rotation. We determined the DNA sequence of the region containing the motA gene and its promoter. Within this sequence, there is an open reading frame of 885 nucleotides, which with high probability (98% confidence level) meets criteria for a coding sequence. The 295-residue amino acid translation product had a molecular weight of 31,974, in good agreement with the value determined experimentally by gel electrophoresis. The amino acid sequence, which was quite hydrophobic, was subjected to a theoretical analysis designed to predict membrane-spanning alpha-helical segments of integral membrane proteins; four such hydrophobic helices were predicted by this treatment. Additional amphipathic helices may also be present. A remarkable feature of the sequence is the existence of two segments of high uncompensated charge density, one positive and the other negative. Possible organization of the protein in the membrane is discussed. Asymmetry in the amino acid composition of translated DNA sequences was used to distinguish between two possible initiation codons. The use of this method as a criterion for authentication of coding regions is described briefly in an Appendix.

8308888|a|A putative complex of the three switch proteins, FliG, FliM and FliN appears to be directly involved in torque generation and control of direction of rotation. We have developed a preparative procedure for flagellar motors that retains these proteins as evidenced by Western blots using anti-FliG, anti-FliM and anti-FliN antibodies. Immunogold labeling with these three antibodies shows that the three switch proteins are localized to the motor. Electron micrographs of frozen-hydrated preparations reveal a large, new component we have termed the "C ring complex" attached to the cytoplasmic face of the M ring. In a three-dimensional reconstruction of the cylindrically averaged structure, the M-S ring complex appears thicker and wider by the addition of extra material to the cytoplasmic surface of the M ring. In addition, extending into the cytoplasm from the thickened M ring is the C ring complex, a thin-walled cylinder having a length of 170 A and an outer diameter of 450 A compared to the 290 A diameter of the M ring. We provide evidence that the thickened M ring contains FliG and that the C ring complex may contain FliM and FliN. The large diameter of the C ring complex may permit interaction with the M ring and with the circlet of studs thought to be the MotA/MotB complex.

3597320|a|The 5 to 10 peritrichously inserted complex flagella of Rhizobium meliloti MVII-1 were found to form right-handed flagellar bundles. Bacteria swam at speeds up to 60 microns/s, their random three-dimensional walk consisting of straight runs and quick directional changes (turns) without the vigorous angular motion (tumbling) seen in swimming Escherichia coli cells. Observations of R. meliloti cells tethered by a single flagellar filament revealed that flagellar rotation was exclusively clockwise, interrupted by very brief stops (shorter than 0.1 s), typically every 1 to 2 s. Swimming bacteria responded to chemotactic stimuli by extending their runs, and tethered bacteria responded by prolonged intervals of clockwise rotation. Moreover, the motility tracks of a generally nonchemotactic ("smooth") mutant consisted of long runs without sharp turns, and tethered mutant cells showed continuous clockwise rotation without detectable stops. These observations suggested that the runs of swimming cells correspond to clockwise flagellar rotation, and the turns correspond to the brief rotation stops. We propose that single rotating flagella (depending on their insertion point on the rod-shaped bacterial surface) can reorient a swimming cell whenever the majority of flagellar motors stop.

7623670|a|Genes controlling chemotaxis towards L-amino acids and D-mannitol in Rhizobium meliloti have been identified by Tn5 insertions that lead to chemotaxis-deficient mutants. The tagged genes span an 8.7 kbp region that has been sequenced. These genes are part of a large operon containing three novel open reading frames, orf1, orf2 and orf9, and six familiar chemotaxis (che) genes, cheY1-cheA-cheW-cheR-cheB-cheY2, that have been assigned by their similarity to known Escherichia coli genes. The second copy of cheY may be part of a second signalling chain; orf1 and orf2 encode sequence motifs that resemble the signalling domain of E. coli MCPs (methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins), while the product of orf9 may contain a transmembrane domain. No protein methylation has been observed in Rhizobium meliloti in response to L-amino acids. However, the presence of cheR (methyltransferase gene) and cheB (methylesterase gene) suggested that MCPs are likely components of the chemotactic response in R. meliloti. Therefore, it is postulated that two chemotaxis pathways are functional in R. meliloti: one responds to L-amino acids via ORF1-ORF2, whereas the other (probably responding to specific plant exudates) acts via MCP-like receptors, and both interact with the central components CheW-CheA-CheY1 and/or CheY2.

1809831|a|Synthesis of bacterial flagella and the accompanying array of chemotaxis receptors and transducers represents a major commitment of energy and resources for a growing bacterial cell and is subject to numerous levels of regulation. Genes for flagellar and chemotaxis proteins are expressed in a complex transcriptional cascade. This regulatory hierarchy acts to ensure that the highly expressed filament structural protein, flagellin, is synthesized only after a prerequisite set of structural proteins has been expressed and properly assembled. Recent evidence suggests that many bacteria utilize an alternative sigma (sigma) subunit, similar in specificity to the Bacillus subtilis sigma 28 protein, to direct transcription of flagellin, chemotaxis and motility genes. In Caulobacter crescentus and Campylobacter spp., both a sigma 54-like factor and a sigma 28-like factor participate in the transcription of flagellar and chemotaxis genes. Conversely, a sigma 28-like factor controls non-motility functions in at least one non-flagellated organism.

6885795|a|Flagellar motors of some alkalophilic Bacillus strains have been suggested to be powered by the electrochemical potential gradient of Na+, namely the (formula: see text) (Hirota, N., Kitada, M., and Imae, Y. (1981) FEBS Lett. 132, 278-280). In the present study, we quantitatively measured the (formula: see text) and motility of one of the strains, YN-1. Swimming speed of YN-1 cells increased linearly with a logarithmic increase of Na+ concentration in the medium up to 100 mM. The intracellular Na+ concentration and the membrane potential of the cell were about 30 mM and -170 mV, respectively, and stayed constant irrespective of Na+ concentration in the medium. Thus, the swimming speed changed as a function of the chemical potential difference of Na+ across the cell membrane. When the membrane potential of YN-1 cells was decreased by a combination of valinomycin and various concentrations of K+ in the medium, the swimming speed of the cells decreased linearly and reached zero at around -90 mV. Under the condition, the intracellular Na+ concentration stayed constant. Thus, the membrane potential was also a determinant of the swimming speed. Furthermore, the chemical potential of Na+ and the membrane potential were found to be equivalent as the energy source for motility. Therefore, it is concluded that the (formula: see text) is the energy source for the flagellar motors of YN-1 cells. Threshold value of the (formula: see text) for motility was about -100 mV.

8423152|a|FliG, FliM, and FliN are three proteins of Salmonella typhimurium that affect the rotation and switching of direction of the flagellar motor. An analysis of mutant alleles of FliM has been described recently (H. Sockett, S. Yamaguchi, M. Kihara, V. M. Irikura, and R. M. Macnab, J. Bacteriol. 174:793-806, 1992). We have now analyzed a large number of mutations in the fliG and fliN genes that are responsible for four different types of defects: failure to assembly flagella (nonflagellate phenotype), failure to rotate flagella (paralyzed phenotype), and failure to display normal chemotaxis as a result of an abnormally high bias to clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) rotation (CW-bias and CCW-bias phenotypes, respectively). The null phenotype for fliG, caused by nonsense or frameshift mutations, was nonflagellate. However, a considerable part of the FliG amino acid sequence was not needed for flagellation, with several substantial in-frame deletions preventing motor rotation but not flagellar assembly. Missense mutations in fliG causing paralysis or abnormal switching occurred at a number of positions, almost all within the middle one-third of the gene. CW-bias and CCW-bias mutations tended to segregate into separate subclusters. The null phenotype of fliN is uncertain, since frameshift and nonsense mutations gave in some cases the nonflagellate phenotype and in other cases the paralyzed phenotype; in none of these cases was the phenotype a consequence of polar effects on downstream flagellar genes. Few positions in FliN were found to affect switching: only one gave rise to the CW mutant bias and only four gave rise to the CCW mutant bias. The different properties of the FliM, FliG, and FliN proteins with respect to the processes of assembly, rotation, and switching are discussed.

1882727|a|The bacterial flagellum is a complex multicomponent structure which serves as the propulsive organelle for many species of bacteria. Rotation of the helical flagellar filament, driven by a proton-powered motor embedded in the cell wall, enables the flagellum to function as a screw propeller. It seems likely that almost all of the genes required for flagellar formation and function have been identified. Continuing analysis of the portions of the genome containing these genes may reveal the existence of a few more. Transcription of the flagellar genes is under the control of the products of a single operon, and so these genes constitute a regulon. Other controls, both transcriptional and post-transcriptional, have been identified. Many of these genes have been sequenced, and the information obtained will aid in the design of experiments to clarify the various regulatory mechanisms of the flagellar regulon. The flagellum is composed of several substructures. The long helical filament is connected via the flexible hook to the complex basal body which is located in the cell wall. The filament is composed of many copies of a single protein, and can adopt a number of distinct helical forms. Structural analyses of the filament are adding to our understanding of this dynamic polymer. The component proteins of the hook and filament have all been identified. Continuing studies on the structure of the basal body have revealed the presence of several hitherto unknown basal-body proteins, whose identities and functions have yet to be elucidated. The proteins essential for energizing the motor, the Mot and switch proteins, are thought to exist as multisubunit complexes peripheral to the basal body. These complexes have yet to be identified biochemically or morphologically. Not surprisingly, flagellar assembly is a complex process, occurring in several stages. Assembly occurs in a proximal-to-distal fashion; the basal body is assembled before the hook, and the hook before the filament. This pattern is also maintained within the filament, with monomers added at the distal end of the polymer; the same is presumably true of the other axial components. An exception to this general pattern is assembly of the Mot proteins into the motor, which appears to be possible at any time during flagellar assembly. With the identification of the genes encoding many of the flagellar proteins, the roles of these proteins in assembly is understood, but the function of a number of gene products in flagellar formation remains unknown.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

3050128|a|Direct freezing procedures have enabled us to visualize distinctive intramembrane particle ring structures in the cytoplasmic membranes of peritrichously flagellated bacteria by means of freeze-fracture electron microscopy. These structures were identified as flagellar motor components because their distribution matched that of flagella, and because they were absent in non-flagellated mutants of Escherichia coli. Particle rings were present in both the Gram-positive Streptococcus and the Gram-negative E. coli. In E. coli, a non-functional mocha operon produced flagellated but immotile cells lacking the particle rings. Simultaneous introduction of the motA and motB genes, led to recovery of both motility and the ring structures but neither gene alone was sufficient. The concomitant loss of the rings and motility is consistent with the ring particles having a central role in the flagellar motor.

2656645|a|The fliG, fliM, and fliN genes of Salmonella typhimurium encode flagellar components that participate in energy transduction and switching. We have cloned these genes and determined their sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences correspond to proteins with molecular masses of 36,809, 37,815, and 14,772 daltons, respectively. None of the protein sequences are especially hydrophobic or look as though they correspond to integral membrane proteins, a result consistent with other evidence suggesting that the proteins may be peripheral to the membrane, possibly mounted onto the basal body M ring. The fliL gene, which immediately precedes fliM, is of unknown function; it encodes a protein with a deduced molecular mass of 17,082 daltons. The hydropathy profile of FliL indicates that it is likely to be an integral membrane protein with at least one spanning segment, near its N terminus. None of the four proteins exhibit consensus N-terminal signal sequences. Comparison of the fliL, fliM, and fliN sequences with the homologous ones in Escherichia coli reveals ranges of similarities of 77 to 95% at the amino acid level and 75 to 86% at the nucleotide level, with the majority (58 to 89%) of codon changes being synonymous ones.

3980440|a|The complex flagella of Rhizobium meliloti 2011 and MVII-1 were analyzed with regard to serology, fine structure, subunits, and amino acid composition. The serological identities of flagellar filaments of the two strains were demonstrated by double immunodiffusion with antiflagellin antiserum. The filaments had a diameter of 16 nm. Their morphology was dominated by the prominent undulations of an external three-start helix running at a 10-nm axial distance and at an angle of 32 degrees. Faint nearly axial striations indicated the presence of a tubular core of a different helical order. The complex filaments consisted of 40,000-dalton flagellin monomers. Typically, the amino acid composition was 3 to 4% higher in nonpolar residues and 5 to 7% lower in aspartic and glutamic acids (and their amides) than that of plain flagellar proteins. There were no immunochemical relationships among Pseudomonas rhodos, Rhizobium lupini, and R. meliloti complex flagella, suggesting that the latter represent a new class.

2115488|a|A series of broad-host-range expression and lac fusion vectors, based on RSF1010 derivatives, was constructed. The expression vectors contain various promoters (pNm, plac, ptac and pS1) for expression of foreign genes. The efficiency of the promoters was determined in Escherichia coli, Rhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Pseudomonas putida by beta-galactosidase activity measurements. Of the promoters assayed in E. coli, the most effective is the tac promoter, whereas in soil bacteria the appropriate promoter for overexpression of foreign genes is the NmR promoter. The GmR gene, serving as a selectable marker for the plasmids, was efficiently expressed in R. meliloti as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and thus, pGm was also used to construct an expression vector. The translational fusion vectors allow the identification and characterization of promoter-carrying cloned fragments on the translational level, whereas the transcriptional fusion vectors can be used to identify and to study promoters on cloned fragments. All lac fusion vectors contain the E. coli lacZ gene or the complete lac operon facilitating quantification of expression.

3127470|a|We developed a dual wavelength spectrophotometric assay that permitted beta-lactamase and beta-galactosidase activities to be measured concurrently in a single sample. We also constructed a target cell, E. coli ML-35p, that was substantially cryptic for its periplasmic beta-lactamase and cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase unless outer membrane (beta-lactamase) or inner membrane (beta-galactosidase) permeabilization occurred. By applying the spectrophotometric assay to whole target cells, we could ascertain the kinetics of inner and outer membrane permeabilization by biological agents, including serum, polymyxin B and mellitin. By monitoring the reactions at an additional wavelength, we could also follow the kinetics of serum-mediated bacteriolysis. These experiments illustrate the principle of multiple wavelength spectrophotometry and provide examples of its use to monitor and dissect the action of biological agents on a gram-negative bacterium.

2842308|a|We have developed a system for using TnphoA (TnphoA is Tn5 IS50L::phoA), which generates fusions to alkaline phosphatase (C. Manoil and J. Beckwith, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:8129-8133, 1985), in Rhizobium meliloti. Active fusions expressing alkaline phosphatase can arise only when this transposon inserts in genes encoding secreted or membrane-spanning proteins. By confining our screening to 1,250 TnphoA-generated mutants of R. meliloti that expressed alkaline phosphatase, we efficiently identified 25 symbiotically defective mutants, all of which formed ineffective (Fix-) nodules on alfalfa. Thirteen of the mutants were unable to synthesize an acidic exopolysaccharide (exo::TnphoA) that is required for nodule invasion. Twelve of the mutations created blocked at later stages of nodule development (fix::TnphoA) and were assigned to nine symbiotic loci. One of these appeared to be a previously undescribed locus located on the pRmeSU47a megaplasmid and to encode a membrane protein. Two others were located on the pRmeSU47b megaplasmid: one was a new locus which was induced by luteolin and encoded a membrane protein, and the other was dctA, the structural gene for dicarboxylic acid transport. The remaining six loci were located on the R. meliloti chromosome. One of these was inducible by luteolin and encoded a membrane protein which determined lipopolysaccharide structure. Three additional chromosomal loci also appeared to encode membrane proteins necessary for symbiosis. The remaining two chromosomal loci encoded periplasmic proteins required for symbiosis.

2651416|a|The Escherichia coli operon designated flaA contains seven flagellar genes; among them are two switch protein genes whose products are believed to interface with the motility and chemotaxis machinery of the cell. Complementation analysis using several plasmids carrying different portions of the flaA operon and analysis of expression of these plasmids in minicells allowed the identification of two flagellar gene products. The MotD (now called FliN) protein, a flagellar switch protein, was determined to have an apparent molecular weight of 16,000, and the FlaAI (FliL) protein, encoded by a previously unidentified gene, had an apparent molecular weight of 17,000. DNA sequence analysis of the motD gene revealed an open reading frame of 414 base pairs. There were two possible initiation codons (ATG) for motD translation, the first of which overlapped with the termination codon of the upstream gene, flaAII (fliN). The wild-type flaAI gene on the chromosome was replaced with a flaAI gene mutated in vitro. Loss of the flaAI gene product resulted in a nonmotile and nonflagellated phenotype. The subcellular location for both the MotD and FlaAI proteins was determined; the FlaAI protein partitioned exclusively in the insoluble fraction of a whole minicell sonic extract, whereas the MotD protein remained in both the soluble and insoluble fractions. In addition, we subcloned a 2.2-kilobase-pair DNA fragment capable of complementing the remaining four genes of the flaA operon (flbD [fliO], flaR [fliP], flaQ [fliQ], and flaP [fliR]).

19741|a|Streptococcus strain V4051 is motile in the presence of glucose. The cells move steadily along smooth paths (run), jump about briefly with little net displacement (twiddle), and then run in new directions. They stop swimming when deprived of glucose. These cells become motile when an electrical potential or a pH gradient is imposed across the membrane. Starved cells suspended in a potassium-free medium respond to the addition of valinomycin by a brief period of vigorous twiddling. They also twiddle, although less vigorously, when the external pH is lowered. Valinomycin-induced twiddling occurs in the absence of external alkali or alkaline earth cations and without significant net synthesis of ATP. When a chemoattractant is added to cells swimming in the presence of glucose, twiddles are transiently suppressed, and the cells run for a time. Similarly, when starved cells are suspended in a potassium-free medium containing both valinomycin and an attractant, many cells initially run rather than twiddle. We conclude that the flagella are driven by a protonmotive force.

These improved polylinkers have been inserted into plasmids (the pICs) for routine cloning of double-stranded DNA, and into chimeric phage/plasmids (the pICEMs) for biological production of single stranded DNA. The most versatile polylinker specifies 17 restriction sites in the beta-galactosidase alpha-complementing gene fragment. One of the new polylinkers was inserted into M13 DNA to produce a vector (M13mIC7) with nine cloning sites.

667114|a|1. The complex flagella of Rhizobium lupini H13-3 differ from plain bacterial flagella in the fine structure of their filaments dominated by conspicuous helical bands, in their fragility and their resistance against heat decomposition. To elucidate the basis of these differences, the composition of complex filaments and their subunits was analysed. 2. Isolated complex flagella containing the filament and hook protions were purified by differential centrifugation. Hooks were separated by ultracentrifugation after acid degradation of filaments at pH 2. The complex filaments consist of 43 000 dalton monomers (cx-flagellin), the hooks are composed of 41 000 dalton subunits. 3. Amino acid analysis of cx-flagellin indicated the presence of approx. 417 amino acid residues. These comprise 47% hydrophobic residues and 21% Asp and Glu (or amides), but no Cys, His, Pro and Trp. No carbohydrate, phosphate or lipid moieties have been detected. Fingerprint analysis after tryptic digestion yields approx. 36 peptides, about half of them clustered in the neutral region. A comparison with the composition of varous known flagellins from plain flagella indicates a 7% higher content of hydrophobic amino acid residues in complex filaments; this is largely compensated for by the higher content of Glu and Asp (presumably as Gln and Asn) in plain filaments. 4. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis of cx-flagellin yield single precipitin bands indicating homogeneity. In contrast, isoelectric focusing lead to three close-running bands around pH4.7. When isolated, the two major bands again produced an "isoelectric spectrum" suggesting that it reflects an allomorphism of cx-flagellin. 5. Self-assembly experiments with cx-flagellin lead to coiled fibres including helical regions, but not to intact filaments. The products resemble heat-denatured complex filaments and may represent intermediates between monomers and complete polymers.

1624413|a|Two genes controlling motility functions in Bacillus subtilis were identified by DNA sequence analysis of a chromosomal fragment containing a strong promoter for sigma D RNA polymerase. Previous studies had shown that this sigma D-dependent promoter controls synthesis of a 1.6-kb transcript in vivo and in vitro. Sequence analysis revealed that the 1.6-kb transcript contains two open reading frames coding for protein sequences homologous to the Escherichia coli motA and motB gene products, respectively, and ends in a rho-independent termination site. Direct evidence linking these genes to motility functions in B. subtilis was obtained by precise localization by polymerase chain reaction of Tn917 transposon insertion mutations of Mot- strains, isolated by Zuberi et al. (A. R. Zuberi, C. Ying, H. M. Parker, and G. W. Ordal, J. Bacteriol. 172:6841-6848, 1990), to within this mot. operon. Replacement of each wild-type gene by in-frame deletion mutations yielded strains possessing paralyzed flagella and confirmed that both motA and motB are required for the motility of B. subtilis. These current findings support our earlier suggestions that sigma D in B. subtilis plays a central role in the control of gene expression for flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and motility functions. Sigma F, the enteric homolog of sigma D, controls similar functions in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, and these factors appear to be representative of a family of factors implicated in flagellar synthesis in many bacterial species, which we propose to designate the sigma 28 family.

2921241|a|The genomic region that codes for the flagellin subunits of the complex flagellar filaments of Rhizobium meliloti was cloned and sequenced. Two structural genes, flaA and flaB, that encode 395- and 396-amino-acid polypeptides, respectively, were identified. These exhibit 87% sequence identity. The amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides suggest that both of these subunit proteins are represented in the flagellar filaments. The N-terminal methionine was absent from the mature flagellin subunits. Their derived primary structures show almost no relationship to flagellins from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, or Bacillus subtilis but exhibit up to 60% similarity to the N- and C-terminal portions of flagellin from Caulobacter crescentus. It is suggested that the complex flagellar filaments of R. meliloti are unique in being assembled from heterodimers of two related flagellin subunits. The tandemly arranged flagellin genes were shown to be transcribed separately from unusual promoter sequences.

2002009|a|The complex flagellar filaments of Rhizobium meliloti are composed of two related (87% identical) flagellins that are encoded by closely linked, separately transcribed genes, flaA and flaB (E. Pleier and R. Schmitt, J. Bacteriol. 171:1467-1475, 1989). To elucidate the role of the subunits, A and B, in assembling the complex filament, the wild-type alleles were replaced with defective ones containing a 2,249-bp deletion (accompanied by substitution of a kanamycin resistance cartridge), which eliminates 74% of flaA (3' end) and 85% of flaB (5' end). The resulting nonmotile, filamentless mutant, RU11011, was tested for complementation with wild-type flaA, flaB, and flaA flaB genes provided on the multiple-copy vector pRK290. Whereas flaA alone did not restore motility and filament production, both flaB and flaA flaB restored 20 to 30% of wild-type motility. Apparent causes of this reduced motility were fewer flagella per cell and/or shortened filaments sometimes ending in unusually thin, fragile structures. Tests with enzyme-linked antiflagellin antibodies indicated that flaA is expressed at higher levels than flaB and that multiple copies of flaA lead to reduced flagellin export. We conclude that the proximal portion of the complex filament is assembled from B subunits (not produced sufficiently to form full-length flagella) and that the distal portion is made from A subunits. Multiple copies of the strong flaA promoter may offset transcriptional controls that regulate the synthesis of flagellar structures required for flagellin export.

8096622|a|The unifying feature of all proteins that are transported out of the cytoplasm of gram-negative bacteria by the general secretory pathway (GSP) is the presence of a long stretch of predominantly hydrophobic amino acids, the signal sequence. The interaction between signal sequence-bearing proteins and the cytoplasmic membrane may be a spontaneous event driven by the electrochemical energy potential across the cytoplasmic membrane, leading to membrane integration. The translocation of large, hydrophilic polypeptide segments to the periplasmic side of this membrane almost always requires at least six different proteins encoded by the sec genes and is dependent on both ATP hydrolysis and the electrochemical energy potential. Signal peptidases process precursors with a single, amino-terminal signal sequence, allowing them to be released into the periplasm, where they may remain or whence they may be inserted into the outer membrane. Selected proteins may also be transported across this membrane for assembly into cell surface appendages or for release into the extracellular medium. Many bacteria secrete a variety of structurally different proteins by a common pathway, referred to here as the main terminal branch of the GSP. This recently discovered branch pathway comprises at least 14 gene products. Other, simpler terminal branches of the GSP are also used by gram-negative bacteria to secrete a more limited range of extracellular proteins.

Transcription is controlled by the strong phi 10 promoter for T7 RNA polymerase, and in some cases by the T phi transcription terminator. The RNA produced can have as few as two foreign nucleotides ahead of the target sequence or can be cut by RNase III at the end of the target sequence. Target mRNAs can be translated from their own start signals or can be placed under control of start signals for the major capsid protein of T7, with the target coding sequence fused at the start codon or after the 2nd, 11th or 260th codon for the T7 protein. The controlling elements are contained on small DNA fragments that can easily be removed and used to create new expression vectors.

1732214|a|Defects in the chemotaxis proteins CheY and CheZ of Salmonella typhimurium can be suppressed by mutations in the flagellar switch, such that swarming of a pseudorevertant on semisolid plates is significantly better than that of its parent. cheY suppressors contribute to a clockwise switch bias, and cheZ suppressors contribute to a counterclockwise bias. Among the three known switch genes, fliM contributes most examples of such suppressor mutations. We have investigated the changes in FliM that are responsible for suppression, as well as the changes in CheY or CheZ that are being compensated for. Ten independently isolated parental cheY mutations represented nine distinct mutations, one an amino acid duplication and the rest missense mutations. Several of the altered amino acids lie on one face of the three-dimensional structure of CheY (A. M. Stock, J. M. Mottonen, J. B. Stock, and C. E. Schutt, Nature (London) 337:745-749, 1989; K. Volz and P. Matsumura, J. Biol. Chem. 266:15511-15519, 1991); this face may constitute the binding site for the switch. All 10 cheZ mutations were distinct, with several of them resulting in premature termination. cheY and cheZ suppressors in FliM occurred in clusters, which in general did not overlap. A few cheZ suppressors and one cheY suppressor involved changes near the N terminus of FliM, but neither cheY nor cheZ suppressors involved changes near the C terminus. Among the strongest cheY suppressors were changes from Arg to a neutral amino acid or from Val to Glu, suggesting that electrostatic interactions may play an important role in switching. A given cheY or cheZ mutation could be suppressed by many different fliM mutations; conversely, a given fliM mutation was often encountered as a suppressor of more than one cheY or cheZ mutation. The data suggest that an important factor in suppression is a balancing of the shift in switch bias introduced by alteration of CheY or CheZ with an appropriate opposing shift introduced by alteration of FliM. For strains with a severe parental mutation, such as the cheZ null mutations, adjustment of switch bias is essentially the only factor in suppression, since the attractant L-aspartate caused at most a slight further enhancement of the swarming rate over that occurring in the absence of a chemotactic stimulus. We discuss a model for switching in which there are distinct interactions for the counterclockwise and clockwise states, with suppression occurring by impairment of one of the states and hence by relative enhancement of the other state. FliM can also undergo amino acid changes that result in a paralyzed (Mot-) phenotype; these changes were confined to a very few residues in the protein.

8939427|a|Cells of Rhizobium meliloti swim by the unidirectional, clockwise rotation of their right-handed helical flagella and respond to tactic stimuli by modulating the flagellar rotary speed. We have shown that wild-type cells respond to the addition of proline, a strong chemoattractant, by a sustained increase in free-swimming speed (chemokinesis). We have examined the role of two response regulators, CheY1 and CheY2, and of CheA autokinase in the chemotaxis and chemokinesis of R. meliloti by comparing wild-type and mutant strains that carry deletions in the corresponding genes. Swarm tests, capillary assays, and computerized motion analysis revealed that (i) CheY2 alone mediates 60 to 70% of wild-type taxis, whereas CheY1 alone mediates no taxis, but is needed for the full tactic response; (ii) CheY2 is the main response regulator directing chemokinesis and smooth swimming in response to attractant, whereas CheY1 contributes little to chemokinesis, but interferes with smooth swimming; (iii) in a CheY2-overproducing strain, flagellar rotary speed increases upon addition and decreases upon removal of attractant; (iv) both CheY2 and CheY1 require phosphorylation by CheA for activity. We conclude that addition of attractant causes inhibition of CheA kinase and removal causes activation, and that consequent production of CheY1-P and CheY2-P acts to slow the flagellar motor. The action of the chief regulator, CheY2-P, on flagellar rotation is modulated by CheY1, probably by competition for phosphate from CheA.

3007435|a|The motB gene product of Escherichia coli is an integral membrane protein required for rotation of the flagellar motor. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the motB region and find that it contains an open reading frame of 924 nucleotides which we ascribe to the motB gene. The predicted amino acid sequence of the gene product is 308 residues long and indicates an amphipathic protein with one major hydrophobic region, about 22 residues long, near the N terminus. There is no consensus signal sequence. We postulate that the protein has a short N-terminal region in the cytoplasm, an anchoring region in the membrane consisting of two spanning segments, and a large cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. By placing motB under control of the tryptophan operon promoter of Serratia marcescens, we have succeeded in overproducing the MotB protein. Under these conditions, the majority of MotB was found in the cytoplasm, indicating that the membrane has a limited capacity to incorporate the protein. We conclude that insertion of MotB into the membrane requires the presence of other more hydrophobic components, possibly including the MotA protein or other components of the flagellar motor. The results further reinforce the concept that the total flagellar motor consists of more than just the basal body.

We have traced this defect to the coexpression of a fusion protein consisting of 60 amino acids from the N terminus of MotB and 50 amino acids specified by pBR322. Mutations within the N terminus, known to abolish function when present in full-length MotB, reversed the growth defect. Growth also was normal when MotA was coexpressed with wild-type MotB or with a series of MotB N-terminal fragments.

3537305|a|A gene expression system based on bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase has been developed. T7 RNA polymerase is highly selective for its own promoters, which do not occur naturally in Escherichia coli. A relatively small amount of T7 RNA polymerase provided from a cloned copy of T7 gene 1 is sufficient to direct high-level transcription from a T7 promoter in a multicopy plasmid. Such transcription can proceed several times around the plasmid without terminating, and can be so active that transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase is greatly decreased. When a cleavage site for RNase III is introduced, discrete RNAs of plasmid length can accumulate. The natural transcription terminator from T7 DNA also works effectively in the plasmid. Both the rate of synthesis and the accumulation of RNA directed by T7 RNA polymerase can reach levels comparable with those for ribosomal RNAs in a normal cell. These high levels of accumulation suggest that the RNAs are relatively stable, perhaps in part because their great length and/or stem-and-loop structures at their 3' ends help to protect them against exonucleolytic degradation. It seems likely that a specific mRNA produced by T7 RNA polymerase can rapidly saturate the translational machinery of E. coli, so that the rate of protein synthesis from such an mRNA will depend primarily on the efficiency of its translation. When the mRNA is efficiently translated, a target protein can accumulate to greater than 50% of the total cell protein in three hours or less. We have used two ways to deliver active T7 RNA polymerase to the cell; infection by a lambda derivative that carries gene 1, or induction of a chromosomal copy of gene 1 under control of the lacUV5 promoter. When gene 1 is delivered by infection, very toxic target genes can be maintained silent in the cell until T7 RNA polymerase is introduced, when they rapidly become expressed at high levels. When gene 1 is resident in the chromosome, even the very low basal levels of T7 RNA polymerase present in the uninduced cell can prevent the establishment of plasmids carrying toxic target genes, or make the plasmid unstable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

9139919|a|Pseudorevertants (second-site suppressor mutants) were isolated from a set of parental mutants of Salmonella with defects in the flagellar switch genes fliG and fliM. Most of the suppressing mutations lay in flagellar region IIIb of the chromosome. One fliG mutant, SJW2811, gave rise to a large number of suppressor mutations in the motility genes motA and motB, which are in flagellar region II. SJW2811, which has a three-amino-acid deletion (delta Pro-Ala-Ala) at positions 169 to 171 of FliG, had an extreme clockwise motor bias that produced inverse smooth swimming (i.e., swimming by means of clockwise rotation of a hydrodynamically induced right-handed helical bundle), and formed Mot(-)-like colonies on semisolid medium. Unlike previously reported inverse-swimming mutants, it did not show a chemotactic response to serine, and it remained inverse even in a delta che background; thus, its switch is locked in the clockwise state. The location of the mutation further underscores the conclusion from a previous study of spontaneous missense mutants (V. M. Irikura, M. Kihara, S. Yamaguchi, H. Sockett, and R. M. Macnab, J. Bacteriol. 175:802-810, 1993) that a relatively localized region in the central part of the FliG sequence is critically important for switching. All of the second-site mutations in motA and motB caused some impairment of motility, both in the pseudorevertants and in a wild-type fliG background. The mechanism of suppression of the fliG mutation by the mot mutations is complex, involving destabilization of the right-handed flagellar bundle as a result of reduced motor speed. The mutations in the MotA and MotB sequences were clustered to a considerable degree as follows: in transmembrane helices 3 and 4 of MotA and the sole transmembrane helix of MotB, at helix-membrane interfaces, in the cytoplasmic domains of MotA, and in the vicinity of the peptidoglycan binding region of the periplasmic domain of MotB. The potential importance of Lys28 and Asp33 of the MotB sequence for proton delivery to the site of torque generation is discussed.

3656426|a|Electron micrographs of negatively stained preparations were used to obtain a three-dimensional reconstruction of the complex flagellar filament of Rhizobium lupini H13-3. The complex filament has an organization similar to that of the more common plain filament, but the subunits are perturbed in a pairwise fashion to generate a very distinctive set of three continuous ridges of density along the outer surface of the filament. In the three-dimensional map, the design of the complex filament is similar to that of the plain filament described in the accompanying paper. The structures consist of 11 segmented rods of density lying at a radius of 65 to 70 A. The exterior surfaces of both kinds of filaments consist of features that protrude from the segmented rods. The interiors of both consist of arms that extend inwards from the rods. In the case of the complex filament, but not of the plain filament, the inner arms interact to generate three tubular features, which, together with the three outer ridges, may account for the more brittle and, by implication, stiffer nature of the complex filament.

2193926|a|The motility genes motA and motB of Escherichia coli were placed under control of the Serratia marcescens trp promoter. After induction with beta-indoleacrylic acid, the levels of MotA and MotB rose over about a 3-h period, reaching plateau levels approximately 50-fold higher than wild-type levels. Both overproduced proteins inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane. Growth and motility were essentially normal, suggesting that although the motor is a proton-conducting device, MotA and MotB together do not constitute a major proton leak. Derivative plasmids which maintained an intact version of motB but had the motA coding region deleted in various ways were constructed. With these, the levels of MotB were much lower, reaching a peak within 30 min after induction and declining thereafter; pulse-chase measurements indicated that a contributing factor was MotB degradation. The low levels of MotB occurred even with an in-frame internal deletion of motA, whose translational initiation and termination sites were intact, suggesting that it is the MotA protein, rather than the process of MotA synthesis, that is important for MotB stability. Termination at the usual site of overlap with the start of motB (ATGA) was not an absolute requirement for MotB synthesis but did result in higher rates of synthesis than when translation of motA information terminated prematurely. Even in the total absence of MotA, the MotB that was synthesized was found exclusively in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction. In wild-type cells, MotA was estimated by immunoprecipitation to be in about fourfold excess over MotB; a previous estimate of 600 +/- 250 copies of MotA per cell then yielded an estimate of 150 +/- 70 copies of MotB per cell.

8397412|a|Approximately half of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from regions in the world with high contamination of food with the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) contain a mutation in codon 249 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The mutation almost exclusively consists of a G-->T transversion in the third position of this codon, resulting in the insertion of serine at position 249 in the mutant protein. To gain insight into the mechanism of formation of this striking mutational hot spot in hepatocarcinogenesis, we studied the mutagenesis of codons 247-250 of p53 by rat liver microsome-activated AFB1 in human HCC cells HepG2 by restriction fragment length polymorphism/polymerase chain reaction genotypic analysis. AFB1 preferentially induced the transversion of G-->T in the third position of codon 249. However, AFB1 also induced G-->T and C-->A transversions into adjacent codons, albeit at lower frequencies. Since the latter mutations are not observed in HCC it follows that both mutability on the DNA level and altered function of the mutant serine 249 p53 protein are responsible for the observed mutational hot spot in p53 in HCC from AFB1-contaminated areas. Our results are in agreement with an etiological role of AFB1 in hepatocarcinogenesis in regions of the world with AFB1-contaminated food.

2771957|a|Molecular mechanisms responsible for the clinical progression of chronic myelocytic leukemia to its accelerated phase or to blast crisis have not been defined. We found alterations of the p53 gene (p53 is a 53-kDa nuclear protein) including deletions and rearrangements in 8 of 34 patients in blast crisis and 1 of 4 patients in the accelerated phase, but in only 1 of 38 patients in the chronic phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia. Only two other examples of p53 gene alterations were found among 203 patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Transcripts of the p53 gene were uniformly found in chronic-phase cells, but gene expression was variable in blast crisis, and transcripts were reduced or undetectable in 10 of 16 patients. Heterogeneous alterations in the structure and expression of the p53 gene appear to be relatively frequent in blast crisis and may be involved in the evolution of disease.

8247532|a|An analysis of cell lines representing different stages of the B-cell differentiation pathway indicated that about 50% of the cell lines examined expressed exclusively wild type p53 protein. These lines therefore offer a convenient system to study the involvement of p53 in cell differentiation. When 70Z/3, a pre-B cell line which expresses wild type p53, was treated with the differentiation inducer lipopolysaccharide (LPS), it was seen that increased levels of p53 mRNA preceded specific changes in kappa (kappa) immunoglobulin expression. This increased expression of kappa specific mRNA, which was evaluated by specific PCR analysis, was blocked following transfection with mutant p53 coding plasmids. Treatment of 13A60, another cell line which endogenously expresses wild type p53, with LPS caused a secretion of IgA antibodies, also accompanied by increased p53 mRNA expression. The conclusion was that induction of B-cell differentiation involves the transcription of the p53 gene. This was further substantiated by experiments showing that differentiation of stable clones derived from the 70Z/3 cell line, harboring a p53-promoter-CAT plasmid, induced increased CAT activity. Furthermore, wild type p53 transactivated the promoter control sequences of the kappa light chain gene. Taken together, these results suggest that p53 is involved in B-cell differentiation, a pathway which involves DNA rearrangements that may be accompanied by generation of faulty DNA. The fact that wild type p53 was shown to function as a transcriptional factor, coupled with the notion that it is associated with DNA repair systems, may designate p53 as a control protein in the B-cell differentiation pathway.

8642629|a|The effect of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) infection was examined in mice lacking a functional p53 gene. Virus-infected p53-/- mice developed tumors significantly faster than uninfected p53-/- or virus-infected p53+/+ littermates. However, the degree of synergy between MoMLV and the p53 null genotype was weaker than the synergy between either of these and c-myc transgenes. A similar range of T-cell tumor phenotypes was represented in all p53 genotype groups, including p53-/- mice, which developed thymic lymphomas as the most common of several neoplastic diseases. Lack of p53 was associated with higher rates of metastasis and the ready establishment of tumors in tissue culture. Loss of the wild-type allele was a common feature of tumors in p53+/- mice and was complete in tumor cells in vitro, but this appeared to occur by a mechanism other than proviral insertion at the wild-type allele. A lower average MoMLV proviral copy number was observed in tumors of the p53 null and heterozygote groups, suggesting that the absence of a functional p53 gene reduced the number of steps required to complete the malignant phenotype. Mink cell focus-forming virus-like proviruses were detected in tumors of all infected mice but were relatively rare in p53 null mice. Analysis of c-myc, pim-1, and pal-1 showed that these loci were occupied by proviruses in some cases but at similar frequencies in p53 wild-type and null mice. In conclusion, while inactivation of p53 in the germ line predisposes mice to tumors similar in phenotype to those induced by MoMLV, it appears that virus-induced tumors generally occur without p53 loss. We speculate that a bcl-2-like function carried or induced by MoMLV may underlie this p53-independent pathway.

4521215|a|In tumors and embryoid bodies of mouse teratoma a correlation has been established between specific activity of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) and content of embryonal carcinoma, the stem cell of the tumor. A histochemical study of embryoid bodies has shown that high levels of the enzyme are confined to embryonal carcinoma. Fifteen tissue culture lines could be classified into three groups: (a) lines identifiable as pluripotential embryonal carcinoma by their morphology, tumorigenicity, and capacity to differentiate in vivo; (b) nullipotential embryonal carcinoma, resembling pluripotential embryonal carcinoma in morphology and malignancy but giving rise to undifferentiated tumors; and (c) lines of apparently nonmalignant somatic cells. Both types of embryonal carcinoma possess levels of alkaline phosphatase 5- to a 100-fold higher than the somatic cell lines. The embryonal carcinoma enzyme resembles the enzymes from kidney and placenta in kinetics of thermal inactivation and sensitivity to the inhibitor L-phenylalanine, but is distinguishable from the alkaline phosphatases of liver and intestine. These findings are discussed in relation to the use of teratoma for the study of cell differentiation.

1638540|a|Available evidence suggests that, among hematological malignancies, p53 is most often mutated in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). However, much of the published data is based on cell lines. We have, therefore, analyzed BL biopsies to determine more accurately the frequency and pattern of p53 mutations in primary tumors and to determine whether there are differences among the various subtypes of BL. Among 27 BL biopsies from South Africa, we have observed mutations in the p53 gene (exons 5 through 8) in 37% of tumors. The higher frequency of mutations in cell lines (70%) suggests that mutation of p53 may be associated with tumor progression. Summarizing available data we conclude that the presence of mutated p53 in BL is independent of the geographic origin of the tumor, the 8;14 chromosomal breakpoint locations and Epstein-Barr virus association. We also find that the mutational spectrum of p53 in BL differs from that observed in nonlymphoid tumors. More than 50% of mutations in BL are clustered in a small stretch of 33 amino acids (codons 213 to 248). Interestingly, codon 213 appears to be as frequently mutated as codon 248. Conversely, codon 273, often mutated in solid tumors, is rarely involved in BL.

1903357|a|The gene responsible for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the more common inherited human disorders, was identified recently, and segments of it were cloned. Two translocation breakpoints that interrupt the NF1 gene in NF1 patients flank a 60-kb segment of DNA that contains the EV12A locus (previously reported as the EV12 locus), the human homolog of a mouse gene, Evi-2A, implicated in retrovirus-induced murine myeloid tumors. EVI2A lies within an intron of the NF1 gene and is transcribed from telomere toward centromere, opposite to the direction of transcription of the NF1 gene. Here we describe a second locus, EVI2B, also located between the two NF1 translocation breakpoints. Full-length cDNAs from the EV12B locus detect a 2.1-kb transcript in bone marrow, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and fibroblasts. Sequencing studies predict an EV12B protein of 448 amino acids that is proline-rich and contains an N-terminal signal peptide, an extracellular domain with four potential glycosylation sites, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic hydrophilic domain. At the level of genomic DNA the EV12B locus lies within the same intron of the NF1 gene as EV12A and contains a 57-bp 5' exon that is noncoding, an 8-kb intron, and a 2078-bp 3' exon that includes the entire open reading frame. EV12B is transcribed in the same direction as EV12A; its 5' exon lies only 4 kb downstream from the 3' exon of the EV12A locus. In the mouse the 5' exon of the homologous gene, Evi-2B, lies approximately 2.8 kb from the 3' end of Evi-2A, in the midst of a cluster of viral integration sites identified in retrovirus-induced myeloid tumors; thus, Evi-2B may function as an oncogene in these tumors.

1379715|a|Cells infected with temperature-sensitive transformation mutants of the Abelson murine leukemia virus express low levels of kinase activity at the nonpermissive temperature, causing transformed pre-B cells to die under these conditions. Examination of cell cycle profiles of such populations prior to cell death reveals that the cells accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Following G1 arrest, the cells die via apoptosis, an active process of cell elimination. Cell synchronization and temperature-shift experiments show that G1 arrest reflects the requirement for a functional v-abl protein during early G1 and that the molecule is not required at other phases of the cell cycle. These data indicate that the substrate(s) critical to v-abl-mediated transformation is involved in regulating G1 transit and that these interactions are dominant over all other changes required for the multistep process that results in the fully malignant phenotype associated with v-abl expression in lymphoid cells.

Short-term thymocyte cultures were prepared from mice constitutively heterozygous or homozygous for a deletion in the p53 gene introduced into the germ line after gene targeting. Wild-type thymocytes readily undergo apoptosis after treatment with ionizing radiation, the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone, or etoposide (an inhibitor of topoisomerase II), or after Ca(2+)-dependent activation by phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore. In contrast, homozygous null p53 thymocytes are resistant to induction of apoptosis by radiation or etoposide, but retain normal sensitivity to glucocorticoid and calcium. The time-dependent apoptosis that occurs in untreated cultures is unaffected by p53 status. Cells heterozygous for p53 deletion are partially resistant to radiation and etoposide. Our results show that p53 exerts a significant and dose-dependent effect in the initiation of apoptosis, but only when it is induced by agents that cause DNA-strand breakage.

7777546|a|The transforming growth factor beta s (TGF-beta s) are a group of multifunctional growth factors which inhibit cell cycle progression in many cell types. The TGF-beta-induced cell cycle arrest has been partially attributed to the regulatory effects of TGF-beta on both the levels and the activities of the G1 cyclins and their kinase partners. The activities of these kinases are negatively regulated by a number of small proteins, p21 (WAF1, Cip1), p27Kip1, p16, and p15INK4B, that physically associate with cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, or cyclin-Cdk complexes. p21 has been previously shown to be transcriptionally induced by DNA damage through p53 as a mediator. We demonstrate that TGF-beta also causes a rapid transcriptional induction of p21, suggesting that p21 can respond to both intracellular and extracellular signals for cell cycle arrest. In contrast to DNA damage, however, induction of p21 by TGF-beta is not dependent on wild-type p53. The cell line studied in these experiments, HaCaT, contains two mutant alleles of p53, which are unable to activate transcription from the p21 promoter when overexpressed. In addition, TGF-beta and p53 act through distinct elements in the p21 promoter. Taken together, these findings suggest that TGF-beta can induce p21 through a p53-independent pathway. Previous findings have implicated p27Kip1 and p15INK2B as effectors mediating the TGF-beta growth inhibitory effect. These results demonstrate that a single extracellular antiproliferative signal, TGF-beta, can act through multiple signaling pathways to elicit a growth arrest response.

8242752|a|The ability of p53 to activate transcription from specific sequences suggests that genes induced by p53 may mediate its biological role as a tumor suppressor. Using a subtractive hybridization approach, we identified a gene, named WAF1, whose induction was associated with wild-type but not mutant p53 gene expression in a human brain tumor cell line. The WAF1 gene was localized to chromosome 6p21.2, and its sequence, structure, and activation by p53 was conserved in rodents. Introduction of WAF1 cDNA suppressed the growth of human brain, lung, and colon tumor cells in culture. Using a yeast enhancer trap, a p53-binding site was identified 2.4 kb upstream of WAF1 coding sequences. The WAF1 promoter, including this p53-binding site, conferred p53-dependent inducibility upon a heterologous reporter gene. These studies define a gene whose expression is directly induced by p53 and that could be an important mediator of p53-dependent tumor growth suppression.

1696637|a|The effect of two missense mutations in abl on transformation by Abelson murine leukemia virus was evaluated. These mutations led to the substitution of a histidine for Tyr-590 and a glycine for Lys-536. Both changes gave rise to strains that were temperature dependent for transformation of both NIH 3T3 cells and lymphoid cells when expressed in the context of a truncated Abelson protein. In the context of the prototype P120 v-abl protein, the Gly-536 substitution generated a host range mutant that induced conditional transformation in lymphoid cells but had only a subtle effect on NIH 3T3 cells. The combination of both substitutions gave rise to a P120 strain that was temperature sensitive for both NIH 3T3 and lymphoid cell transformation. The Abelson proteins encoded by the temperature-sensitive strain displayed in vitro kinase activities that were reduced when compared with those of wild-type proteins. In vivo, levels of phosphotyrosine were reduced only at the restrictive temperature. Analysis of cells expressing either the wild-type P160 v-abl protein or the P210 bcr/abl protein and an Abelson protein encoded by a temperature-sensitive strain failed to correct this defect, suggesting either that tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo is an intramolecular reaction or that the protein encoded by the temperature-sensitive strain is a poor substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo. These results raise the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation of Abelson protein plays a role in transformation.

2832726|a|The 11-4 p53 cDNA clone failed to transform primary rat fibroblasts when cotransfected with the ras oncogene. Two linker insertion mutations at amino acid 158 or 215 (of 390 amino acids) activated this p53 cDNA for transformation with ras. These mutant cDNAs produced a p53 protein that lacked an epitope, recognized by monoclonal antibody PAb246 (localized at amino acids 88 to 110 in the protein) and preferentially bound to a heat shock protein, hsc70. In rat cells transformed by a genomic p53 clone plus ras, two populations of p53 proteins were detected, PAb246+ and PAb246-, which did or did not bind to this monoclonal antibody, respectively. The PAb246- p53 preferentially associated with hsc70, and this protein had a half-life 4- to 20-fold longer than free p53 (PAb246+). These data suggest a possible functional role for hsc70 in the transformation process. cDNAs for p53 derived from methylcholanthrene-transformed cells transform rat cells in cooperation with the ras oncogene and produce a protein that bound with the heat shock proteins. Recombinant clones produced between a Meth A cDNA and 11-4 were tested for the ability to transform rat cells. A single amino acid substitution at residue 132 was sufficient to activate the 11-4 p53 cDNA for transformation. These studies have identified a region between amino acids 132 and 215 in the p53 protein which, when mutated, can activate the p53 cDNA. These results also call into question what the correct p53 wild-type sequence is and whether a wild-type p53 gene can transform cells in culture.

6264122|a|We have prepared full-length DNA clones of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) genome. A specific probe homologous to the central portion of the A-MuLV genome was prepared by nick translation of a subcloned restriction fraction from the cloned DNA. The probe was used to examine the genome structure of several A-MuLV variants. The conclusions are: (i) three viruses coding for Abelson-specific proteins of molecular weight 120,000, 100,000, and 90,000 had genomes indistinguishable in size, suggesting that the shorter proteins are the result of early translational termination; (ii) compared with the genome encoding the 120,000-dalton (120K) protein, a genome coding for a 160K protein was 0.8 kilobase larger in the A-MuLV-specific region; and (iii) a genome coding for a 92K protein had a 700-base pair deletion internal to the coding region. This mutant was transformation defective: its 92K protein lacked the protein kinase activity normally associated with the A-MuLV protein, and cells containing the virus were not morphologically transformed. In addition, we determined the number of A-MuLV proviruses in each of several transformed fibroblast and lymphoid cells prepared by infection in vitro. These experiments show that a single copy of the A-MuLV provirus is sufficient to transform both types of cells and that nonproducer cells generally have only one integrated provirus.

The clonality, patterns of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement, tumorigenicity, and v-abl oncogene expression in individual preleukemic and leukemic colonies were compared. Our results indicate that A-MuLV preleukemic cells with low or undetectable tumorigenic potential give rise to leukemic cells with high tumorigenic potential by a process of subclone selection. The levels of v-abl oncogene product in preleukemic and leukemic cell populations were not significantly different. These results suggest that an additional event(s) unrelated to the level of the v-abl protein product is required for A-MuLV-transformed cells to become fully malignant.

3035219|a|We examined the clonality of tumors induced by an acutely transforming retrovirus which carries a single oncogene. Contrary to our expectation, tumors induced by the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) showed one to four major proviral integration events. To further investigate the process by which clonality was established, we analyzed the number of cells infected and transformed by A-MuLV at various times after in vivo infection. At the midpoint of tumor latency (14 days postinfection), we found that infection of total bone marrow cells by A-MuLV was efficient and polyclonal. However, only a minority of these infected cells were transformed as assayed in cell culture, and clonal dominance had already been established in this transformed cell population. Examination of the in vitro growth properties of transformed cells recovered from preleukemic and leukemic mice indicated that preleukemic cells had lower cloning efficiencies than primary tumor cells. Our results suggest that the rate-limiting step in this system of lymphomagenesis is the initial transformation of bone marrow target cells and that these cells undergo subsequent changes in cloning ability during the course of the disease that lead to an autonomous neoplastic state.

8259216|a|The major events of the cell division cycle are triggered by periodic changes in the activity of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs). In mammals, the members of the CDK family include CDK2 and CDC2, which are thought to be involved in the control of DNA replication and mitosis, respectively. The protein kinase activity of these enzymes is controlled by a complex array of mechanisms. Activation of the CDK catalytic subunit requires association with a positive regulatory subunit (cyclin) and phosphorylation (at Thr 160 in CDK2). This activated complex can be inhibited by additional phosphorylation at Thr 14 and Tyr 15. Here we report the identification of a new mechanism for the regulation of CDK2 activity. We find that CDK2/cyclin complexes in mouse fibroblasts associate tightly with a 20K protein (CAP20). Complexes containing CAP20 were isolated from cell lysates and found to have negligible kinase activity, indicating that CAP20 association in vivo may inhibit CDK2 activity. We purified CAP20 from 3T3 cells and found that low concentrations of the protein completely inhibit the kinase activity of CDK2 in vitro. Thus CAP20 represents a new negative regulatory subunit that inhibits the activity of CDK2/cyclin complexes in mammalian cells.

CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

1752433|a|It has been shown previously that mutant p53 can act as an immortalizing gene when cotransfected into primary rat embryo fibroblasts along with a selectable marker. To determine whether a mutation at the p53 locus is a common event in the pathways leading to spontaneous cellular immortalization, 11 clonally derived BALB/c murine embryo fibroblast lines were established by passage on a 3T3 schedule and examined for p53 alterations. By the following criteria, all 11 independently established lines contain at least one mutant allele of p53. Seven of these lines have a PAb240-reactive p53 species and exhibit an extended p53 half-life as determined by pulse-chase analysis. The p53 protein species in a subset of these lines is also capable of complex formation with the constitutive heat shock protein hsc70. p53 cytoplasmic DNAs (cDNAs) from several of these lines have been cloned by reverse transcription of cytoplasmic RNA followed by PCR amplification, and the mutations have been mapped by DNA sequence analysis. Point mutation in conserved domains of p53 appears to be a common alteration in these lines, although one established line carries a 24-bp in-frame deletion of p53. The remaining four cell lines do not express detectable p53 protein. For each line there is a different molecular event underlying the lack of p53 expression: (1) deletion of at least the first 6 exons of both p53 alleles; (2) expression of a single p53 mRNA encoding a stop codon at amino acid position 173; (3) no detectable p53 mRNA; and (4) greatly diminished expression of p53 mRNA. These findings indicate that p53 alteration commonly occurs in spontaneously immortalized BALB/c mouse embryo fibroblasts passaged on a 3T3 schedule and, therefore, may be an important event for the immortalization process.

3088206|a|In vitro infection of bone marrow or fetal liver cells with retroviruses containing fes, abl, ras, or src oncogenes resulted in the transformation of early B lineage cells. All cell lines tested possessed rearrangements at the Ig heavy chain locus and some had rearrangements at the K chain locus. The majority of the lines corresponded phenotypically to Lyb-2+, Ly-5(B220)+, ThB- large pre-B cells, although some were classified as pro-B cells because of their Lyb-2+, Ly-17+, Ly-5(B220)- phenotype. We identified two cell lines that contained subpopulations of cells that coexpressed the B lineage antigens Lyb-2 and Ly-5(B220) and the myeloid lineage antigen Mac-1. Single-cell FMF cloning of these subpopulations showed that Mac-1+ cells were derived from Mac-1- cells and that these Mac-1+-cloned cells further differentiated into cells with phenotypic and functional characteristics of mature macrophages.

1933891|a|The inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis that follows DNA damage may be critical for avoiding genetic lesions that could contribute to cellular transformation. Exposure of ML-1 myeloblastic leukemia cells to nonlethal doses of the DNA damaging agents, gamma-irradiation or actinomycin D, causes a transient inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis via both G1 and G2 arrests. Levels of p53 protein in ML-1 cells and in proliferating normal bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells increase and decrease in temporal association with the G1 arrest. In contrast, the S-phase arrest of ML-1 cells caused by exposure to the anti-metabolite, cytosine arabinoside, which does not directly damage DNA, is not associated with a significant change in p53 protein levels. Caffeine treatment blocks both the G1 arrest and the induction of p53 protein after gamma-irradiation, thus suggesting that blocking the induction of p53 protein may contribute to the previously observed effects of caffeine on cell cycle changes after DNA damage. Unlike ML-1 cells and normal bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells, hematopoietic cells that either lack p53 gene expression or overexpress a mutant form of the p53 gene do not exhibit a G1 arrest after gamma-irradiation; however, the G2 arrest is unaffected by the status of the p53 gene. These results suggest a role for the wild-type p53 protein in the inhibition of DNA synthesis that follows DNA damage and thus suggest a new mechanism for how the loss of wild-type p53 might contribute to tumorigenesis.

8479522|a|The p53 tumour suppressor gene is the most widely mutated gene in human tumorigenesis. p53 encodes a transcriptional activator whose targets may include genes that regulate genomic stability, the cellular response to DNA damage, and cell-cycle progression. Introduction of wild-type p53 into cell lines that have lost endogenous p53 function can cause growth arrest or induce a process of cell death known as apoptosis. During normal development, self-reactive thymocytes undergo negative selection by apoptosis, which can also be induced in immature thymocytes by other stimuli, including exposure to glucocorticoids and ionizing radiation. Although normal negative selection involves signalling through the T-cell receptor, the induction of apoptosis by other stimuli is poorly understood. We have investigated the requirement for p53 during apoptosis in mouse thymocytes. We report here that immature thymocytes lacking p53 die normally when exposed to compounds that may mimic T-cell receptor engagement and to glucocorticoids but are resistant to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation. These results demonstrate that p53 is required for radiation-induced cell death in the thymus but is not necessary for all forms of apoptosis.

8344486|a|The oncogenic property of simian virus 40 depends in large part on the function of the virus-coded T-antigen. Although the precise mechanism of how T functions during neoplastic transformation is not clear, some answers to this question may lie in our understanding the nature of the proteins found to complex with T. The cellular protein p53 is perhaps the most extensively studied protein in this regard. Recently, p53 was defined as a growth suppressor protein. At about this same time, T was found to complex with another cell growth suppressor protein, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene. It has since become apparent that complex formation between these proteins affects their individual growth-modulating activities. Quite often this alteration of activity correlates with an uncontrolled proliferative state of the cell. Thus, transformation by SV40 is thought to involve complex formation between the viral T oncoprotein and cellular growth suppressor proteins. This complex formation is believed to result in nullification of the growth suppressor protein properties, thus increasing the propensity of the cell toward uncontrolled growth, the hallmark of neoplastic transformation.

8344487|a|The transforming gene products of the small DNA tumor viruses subvert host cell growth control mechanisms by binding to specific cell regulatory proteins. These include the retinoblastoma gene product (pRB) and p53. One indication of the pivotal roles played by these regulatory products is the observation that they are each targeted consistently by viruses of several groups, by adenoviruses, the human papillomaviruses, and the papovaviruses. In adenovirus, pRB and p53 are targeted by the E1A and E1B genes, respectively. The genetic probes made possible by manipulation of the virus genes in vitro have helped to illuminate the pathways in which pRB and p53 function. E1A studies have contributed to our current understanding that the retinoblastoma product is one of a family of related proteins, which with associated cyclins and kinases can modulate the activity of the cellular E2F transcription factor. E1B studies have helped explore models of p53 function, including the suggestion that p53, probably through aspects of its transcription regulating activity, can initiate a pathway in which programmed cell death can be invoked to stop unrestricted cell proliferation.

8551558|a|Abelson murine leukemia virus (Ab-MLV) mutants expressing v-Abl proteins lacking the carboxyl terminus are compromised in the ability to transform lymphoid but not NIH 3T3 cells. This feature correlates with the presence of low levels of phosphotyrosine in lymphoid cells infected with carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants. In contrast, high levels of phosphotyrosine are observed in NIH 3T3 cells infected with wild-type and mutant Ab-MLV. Two downstream targets affected in lymphoid transformants are the GTPase-activating protein and GTPase-activating protein-associated protein p62, molecules which are heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in lymphoid cells transformed by wild-type Ab-MLV but not carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants of Ab-MLV. This difference suggested that signaling mediated via the Ras pathway may be compromised in lymphoid cells expressing the carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants. Consistent with this idea, expression of v-Ha-ras complemented these mutants in primary bone marrow transformation assays and increased transformation frequencies obtained with the Ab-MLV mutants 8- to 20-fold. These data suggest that a biologically important link exists between the carboxyl terminus of v-Abl protein and the Ras pathway. Signals transmitted via this connection may enhance those mediated via other regions of the v-Abl protein and facilitate transformation of primary, nonimmortalized cells such as pre-B lymphocytes.

8376934|a|Pro and pre B cells possess the long-term capacity to proliferate in vitro on stromal cells and interleukin 7 (IL-7) and can differentiate to surface immunoglobulin (sIg+) cells upon removal of IL-7 from the cultures. A key event in this differentiation is the extensive cell loss due to apoptosis. Because the proto-oncogene bcl-2 can promote cell survival, we established pre-B cell lines from E mu-bcl-2 transgenic mice. These pre-B cells have the same properties as those derived from non-bcl-2 transgenic mice except that they do not die by apoptosis. This allowed us to study the fate of newly formed B cells in vitro for a longer period of time. Here we show that early during the differentiation of pre-B cells, upregulation of RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression go hand in hand with rearrangements of the Ig gene loci. Moreover, the newly formed sIg+ B cells continue to express RAG-1 and RAG-2 and continue to rearrange L chain gene loci, even in the absence of proliferation, in an orderly fashion, so that kappa L+ sIg+ cells can become lambda L+ sIg+ or sIg- cells, whereas lambda L+ sIg+ cells can become sIg-, but not kappa L+ sIg+ cells. Thus, deposition of a complete Ig molecule on the surface of a B cell does not automatically stop the Ig-rearrangement machinery.

8061334|a|The abl oncogene was originally discovered in Abelson virus, a murine retrovirus. This virus and the protein tyrosine kinase encoded by abl are well known for their ability to transform B lymphocyte progenitors. Most of the transformed cells resemble a normal B lineage progenitor called a pre-B cell and appear to be arrested in differentiation at the stage of immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangement. Recent evidence obtained using temperature-sensitive Abelson virus mutants provides direct support for this idea. Lymphoid cells transformed by one such virus undergo light chain rearrangement soon after shift to the nonpermissive temperature. This event is accompanied by several changes classically associated with light chain gene rearrangement including increased activity of the NF-kappa B transcription factor, expression of light chain RNAs and increased levels of expression of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes. Although the mechanism by which abl protein blocks the activity of these factors is not yet known, these data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may be intimately connected to regulation of early B cell development and expression of genes that are central to all phases of antigen receptor gene rearrangement.

178822|a|A quantitative Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) lymphoid cell transformation assay has been developed using a semisolid agarose culture system. Under these conditions lymphoid cell transformation was shown to vary linearly with the dose of A-MuLV used. The susceptibility of bone marrow cells from different strains of mice to A-MuLV-induced transformation can be estimated using the agarose assay. Strains with bone marrow cells of high, medium, and low susceptibility to A-MuLV can be identified. The assay has been used to study the susceptibility of cells from lymphoid organs of fetal and adult mice to A-MuLV. Cell suspensions from fetal liver, adult bone marrow, and adult spleen are susceptible to A-MuLV, while thymocytes are resistant to A-MuLV-induced transformation. Bovine serum albumin gradient fractionation of bone marrow cells before infection with A-MuLV demonstrates that the majority of A-MuLV-sensitive cells are recovered in a broad band partially overlapping the majority of the nucleated cells. The agarose assay system allows study of A-MuLV-lymphoid cell interaction at the level of single cell-single virus particle interaction.

1451113|a|The observation made over 30 years ago that the Philadelphia chromosome is present in nearly all patients with CML led to the identification of a novel fusion gene bcr-abl. In the past few years, the biochemical and biological properties of bcr-abl have been extensively explored. Bcr sequences appear to activate c-abl for transformation by binding to the SH2 domain of c-abl in an intramolecular interaction, presumably interfering with the adjacent SH3 regulatory domain. Upon introduction into bone marrow cells, bcr-abl can cause acute or chronic leukaemias in mice and can stimulate the growth of many cell types, including multipotent stem cells, in vitro. Although their growth is stimulated, these cells are not fully malignant blastic leukaemias. The molecular events that occur during the progression to blast crisis of CML remain largely undefined, but existing animal models and in vitro culture systems will be useful for identifying or testing candidate genes. The study of tyrosine kinase oncogenes in general will probably lead to the identification of relevant bcr-abl substrates. The elucidation of these molecules as well as more downstream events in the bcr-abl signalling pathway offers the hope for novel therapeutic interventions to control Philadelphia chromosome leukaemias.

Genetic alterations affecting p16(INK4a) and cyclin D1, proteins that govern phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and control exit from the G1 phase of the cell cycle, are so frequent in human cancers that inactivation of this pathway may well be necessary for tumor development. Like the tumor suppressor protein p53, components of this "RB pathway," although not essential for the cell cycle per se, may participate in checkpoint functions that regulate homeostatic tissue renewal throughout life.

8221671|a|Mutations within a conserved "conformational" domain of the p53 protein have frequently been observed in a wide variety of human cancers. A hybrid protein containing the wild-type conformational domain of p53 fused to protein A bound to calf thymus DNA and a specific p53 DNA-binding motif. Hybrid proteins containing mutations in p53 bound to DNA less efficiently than wild-type hybrid protein. In addition, competition experiments showed that mutated p53 DNA-binding motif failed to interact with p53 hybrid proteins. The DNA-binding activity of wild-type p53 hybrid protein was inhibited by the metal chelator 1,10-phenanthroline. These results demonstrate that DNA-binding activity resides in the conformational domain of p53, providing a structural model for disruption of DNA binding by mutation. Furthermore, metal ions may regulate binding of p53 to DNA by modulating its conformation.

Here the PAb240 epitope is defined using a filamentous phage epitope library. The hexapeptides displayed by the PAb240-binding phage isolated from the library were all highly related and allowed both direct localization of the epitope and prediction of a specific interaction between PAb240 and Xenopus TFIIIA. This study demonstrates for the first time the power of phage epitope libraries in the precise definition of previously unmapped epitopes. Identification of the PAb240 epitope precisely defines a region of the p53 molecule structurally altered by the mutation-induced conformational shift.

1443535|a|Using flow cytometry, we describe a method for separating and quantifying normal and apoptotic thymocytes. Apoptosis was induced in isolated thymocytes from immature rats by treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone or the antitumor agent etoposide. Subsequent incubation with the vital bisbenzimidazole dye Hoechst 33342 and the DNA intercalating agent propidium iodide enabled three distinct populations of cells to be identified and sorted by flow cytometry. Dead cells fluoresced red due to propidium iodide whereas normal and apoptotic cells fluoresced blue due to Hoechst 33342. Apoptotic cells were distinguished from normal thymocytes both by their higher intensity of blue fluorescence and by their smaller size as determined by a reduction in forward light scatter. The larger cells, with low blue fluorescence, showed normal thymocyte morphology by electron microscopy and the absence of any DNA fragmentation as measured by agarose gel electrophoresis. In contrast, the smaller cells showed both the morphological characteristics of apoptosis and extensive internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA to multiples of approximately 180 bp. Using this method, a time-dependent induction of apoptosis by dexamethasone, which was inhibited by cycloheximide, actinomycin D, and aurin tricarboxylate, was observed. The method should facilitate mechanistic studies on the induction of apoptosis in thymocytes.

1577279|a|Clones of mortal chicken fibroblasts and erythroblasts transformed by temperature-sensitive v-src and v-erb B oncoproteins have been developed into immortal cell lines that retain the conditional transformed phenotype. The expressions of two tumor suppressor genes, the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene and the p53 gene, were investigated during senescence, crisis, and cell line establishment. In temperature-sensitive (ts)-v-erb B erythroblasts and ts-v-src fibroblasts (as well as in v-myc macrophages), loss of p53 mRNA or expression of a mutated p53 gene invariably occurred in the early phase of immortalization. In contrast, expression of the Rb gene was unchanged at all stages of immortalization. Inactivation of the original temperature-sensitive oncogene led to loss of the transformed phenotype in fibroblasts and to differentiation in erythroblasts, even in lines that were immortal and lacked p53. The results demonstrate that the process of immortalization is distinct from cell transformation, probably requiring different mutational events.

Pulsed-field gel and Southern blot analyses reveal the mutations to be deletions of 190, 40, and 11 kb of DNA. The 11 kb deletion does not contain any of the previously characterized genes that lie between two NF1 translocation breakpoints, but it does include a portion of a rodent/human conserved DNA sequence previously shown to span one of the translocation breakpoints. By screening cDNA libraries with the conserved sequence, we identified a number of cDNA clones from the translocation breakpoint region (TBR), one of which hybridizes to an approximately 11 kb mRNA. The TBR gene crosses at least one of the chromosome 17 translocation breakpoints found in NF1 patients. Furthermore, the newly characterized NF1 deletions remove internal exons of the TBR gene. Although these mutations might act by compromising regulatory elements affecting some other gene, these findings strongly suggest that the TBR gene is the NF1 gene.

6275106|a|We have designed a method for growing bone marrow cells infected with Abelson murine leukemia virus which permits examination of target cell growth early after infection. This culture system increases the efficiency of target cell growth by favoring rapid growth of a mixed population of adherent cells in the primary culture. The nonadherent Abelson virus-infected cell populations expressed pre-B-cell differentiation markers characteristic of Abelson virus-transformed cells (mu-heavy chains of immunoglobulin M and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase). Early after infection, these cell populations exhibited restricted in vitro and in vivo growth properties which differed from those of an established Abelson virus-transformed cell line, 2M3. These included a marked dependency upon the adherent cell layer for growth and viability, a lower efficiency of agar colony formation, and a lower capacity for tumor production in syngeneic animals. Growth of the early populations could be maintained in the absence of the adherent cell layer by using conditioned medium from long-term adherent cell cultures established in the absence of viral infection. After passage of the populations for several weeks, the in vitro growth properties gradually shifted toward that of the 2M3 cell line. Twelve-week-old populations grew independently of the adherent cell layer and showed an increased efficiency of agar colony formation. These data indicate that many lymphoid target cells exhibit an intermediate transformed phenotype when infected with Abelson virus. Growth of these cells in culture is mediated via a synergistic interaction between intracellular expression of the viral transforming gene and an exogenous growth-promoting activity which can be provided by cultures of adherent bone marrow cells.

6304498|a|Some molecular changes which correlate with the tumorigenic progression of neoplastic cells can best be studied with in vitro cell lines that represent each stage in the progression. Lymphoid cells infected by Abelson murine leukemia virus exhibit a wide range of growth potential in vitro and in vivo. Uncloned populations that are poorly oncogenic early after infection become progressively more oncogenic with successive passages of the cells in culture. In such mass cultures, it is difficult to evaluate whether a rare subpopulation of highly oncogenic cells becomes dominant in the culture or whether the individual cells progress in oncogenic phenotype. To examine this latter possibility, Abelson virus-infected lymphoid cells were cloned by limiting-dilution culture 10 days postinfection. We isolated two clones that grew poorly in agar, required feeder layers of adherent bone marrow cells for growth in liquid culture, and were extremely slow to form tumors in syngeneic animals. Both clones, after passage in the presence of adherent feeder layers for 3 months, grew well in liquid and agar-containing cultures in the absence of feeder layers and formed tumors in animals at a rapid rate. The progression of these clonal cell lines to a more malignant growth phenotype occurred in the absence of detectable changes in the concentration, half-life, phosphorylation, in vitro kinase activity, or cell localization of the Abelson virus-encoded transforming protein. No change in the concentration or arrangement of integrated Abelson viral DNA sequences was detected in either clone. Thus, perhaps changes in the expression of cellular genes would appear to alter the growth properties of lymphoid cells after their initial transformation by Abelson virus. Such cellular changes could complement the activity of the Abelson virus transforming protein in producing the fully malignant growth phenotype.

Of many strains tested, only C57L/J reproducibly rejected syngenic A-MuLV-induced tumor cells; after multiple immunizations their sera would immunoprecipitate both P120 and Moloney-MuLV (M-MuLV) proteins. Using labeled A-MuLV-induced nonproducer cells, only P120 could be detected by anti-AbT sera, suggesting that it may be the only A-MuLV-specified protein. Reactivity of anti-AbT sera with P120 was not blocked by M-MuLV virion proteins, implying that the sera recognize a portion of P120 that is not homologous to any M-MuLV product. Anti-AbT sera stained the surface of live, A-MuLV-transformed nonproducer cells in a two-stage immunofluorescence assay, and such staining was not blocked by M-MuLV protein. Also, intact A-MuLV-transformed cells absorbed much of the reactivity of certain anti-AbT sera for P120. Thus a portion of P120 appears to be exposed on the surface of transformed cells. P120 lacks detectable carbohydrate, is not affected by endoglycosidase H, and cannot be labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination. Thus P120 is an unusual surface protein.

6144042|a|Cells of the Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed line L12 that lack the p53 protein also lack polyadenylated mRNA capable of directing the synthesis of p53 in a cell-free system. Direct analysis of stable polyadenylated mRNA from a variety of cell lines shows that all p53 producers shared a common mRNA species (2.0 kilobases) which hybridized with a p53-specific cDNA probe. This species, which appears to be the mature, normal-sized p53 mRNA, was totally undetectable in L12 cells, which did not produce p53 in vivo. However, L12 cells contained two major p53-specific mRNA species of a substantially larger size (3.5 and 6.5 kilobases) than the p53-specific mRNA in the p53-producing cells. Genomic DNA analysis uncovered an apparent alteration in the 5' proximal part of only one p53 gene, which is unique to the L12 cell line. It is thus possible that the nonproducer phenotype of L12 cells is due at least in part to an alteration within a p53-specific DNA sequence. These findings define a system in which production of p53 appears to be efficiently regulated at the level of stable mRNA and which can be used to study the mechanisms controlling p53 expression in Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed cells.

Transfection of L12 cells with a functional p53 gene, contained in a 16 kb Eco RI genomic cloned fragment gave rise to L12-derived cell lines with novel p53 sequences of various sizes and copy number. A high percentage of L12-derived clones efficiently transcribed p53 mRNA and synthesized the p53 protein. Whereas injection of L12 parental cells into syngeneic mice caused the development of local tumors that later regressed, L12-derived clones that expressed p53 caused lethal tumors in syngeneic mice, thus behaving similarly to other Ab-MuLV-transformed p53-producer cell lines. These results suggest that the expression of p53 is essential for tumor cells to exhibit a fully transformed phenotype, manifested in lethal tumors in syngeneic mice.

The active p53 gene, usually contained in a 16-kilobase EcoRI DNA fragment of p53 producer cells, went through major alterations leading to the appearance of a substantially larger 28.0-kilobase p53-specific EcoRI fragment. Detailed restriction enzyme analysis, with genomic probes spanning throughout the whole active p53 gene, indicated that the L12 p53 altered gene contains all the exons and principal introns of the normal p53 16.0-kilobase gene. However, its structure was interrupted by the integration of a novel DNA segment into the noncoding intervening sequences of the first p53 intron. Analysis of the inserted sequences revealed close homology to Moloney murine leukemia virus. This Moloney leukemia murine virus-like particle resides in a 5' to 3' transcriptional orientation, similar to the p53 gene, permitting the transcription of aberrant fused mRNA molecules detected in these cells.

1852210|a|Wild-type p53 protein has many properties consistent with its being the product of a tumour suppressor gene. Although the normal roles of tumour suppressor genes are still largely unknown, it seems that they could be involved in promoting cell differentiation as well as in mediating growth arrest by growth-inhibitory cytokines. Hence, the abrogation of wild-type p53 expression, which is a common feature of many tumours, could eliminate these activities. We have now tested this notion by restoring the expression of p53 in a murine myeloid leukaemic cell line that normally lacks p53. The use of a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant allowed us to analyse cells in which the introduced p53 had either wild-type or mutant properties. Although there seemed to be no effect on differentiation, the introduction of wild-type p53 resulted in rapid loss of cell viability in a way characteristic of apoptosis (programmed cell death). The effect of wild-type p53 was counteracted by interleukin-6. Thus products of tumour suppressor genes could be involved in restricting precursor cell populations by mediating apoptosis.

3292539|a|We have produced monoclonal antibodies against purified nuclei from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have characterized three different antibodies that recognize a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 38,000, termed p38. Subcellular fractionation shows that virtually all of p38 occurs in the nuclear fraction. High concentrations of salt (1 M) or urea (6 M) effectively solubilize p38 from a nuclear envelope fraction prepared by digestion of nuclei with DNase. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrates a crescent shaped distribution of p38 at the inner periphery of the nucleus, with p38 extending between dividing pairs of cells during (closed) mitosis. Postembedding immunogold electron microscopy shows decoration of the densely stained "crescent" region of the yeast nucleus, confirming the localization of p38 to the nucleolus. One of the monoclonals, D77, cross reacts on immunoblots with a single protein of molecular weight 37,000 from purified rat liver nuclei. Indirect immunofluorescence localizes this protein to the nucleolus, and shows that it is dispersed throughout the cell during mitosis. The yeast and rat liver nucleolar proteins behave similarly when electrophoresed in two dimensions, and appear to have basic pI values. Analysis of immunological cross-reactivity using D77, and antibodies specific for nucleolar proteins from other sources, suggests that the rat liver protein is fibrillarin, and demonstrates that p38 shares epitopes with fibrillarin, as well as with other vertebrate nucleolar proteins.

8132712|a|Under nutrient-deficient conditions, the yeast S. cerevisiae sequesters its own cytoplasmic components into vacuoles in the form of "autophagic bodies" (Takeshige, K., M. Baba, S. Tsuboi, T. Noda, and Y. Ohsumi. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 119:301-311). Immunoelectron microscopy showed that two cytosolic marker enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase, are present in the autophagic bodies at the same densities as in the cytosol, but are not present in vacuolar sap, suggesting that cytosolic enzymes are also taken up into the autophagic bodies. To understand this process, we performed morphological analyses by transmission and immunological electron microscopies using a freeze-substitution fixation method. Spherical structures completely enclosed in a double membrane were found near the vacuoles of protease-deficient mutant cells when the cells were shifted to nutrient-starvation media. Their size, membrane thickness, and contents of double membrane-structures corresponded well with those of autophagic bodies. Sometimes these double membrane structures were found to be in contact with the vacuolar membrane. Furthermore their outer membrane was occasionally seen to be continuous with the vacuolar membrane. Histochemical staining of carbohydrate strongly suggested that the structures with double membranes fused with the vacuoles. These results indicated that these structures are precursors of autophagic bodies, "autophagosomes" in yeast. All the data obtained suggested that the autophagic process in yeast is essentially similar to that of the lysosomal system in mammalian cells.

7813763|a|Extracellular signals can affect the rate of proliferation and the state of differentiation of eukaryotic cells. Signal transduction pathways have evolved to detect these signals at the plasma membrane, transmit them through the cytoplasm and into the nucleus, and thereby generate the appropriate changes in metabolism and transcription. Much attention has been focused recently on regulatory pathways of this sort that lead to activation of a family of protein kinases known as the mitogen- or messenger-activated, or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (MAPKs or ERKs) because this particular class of enzyme is highly conserved among eukaryotes, as is documented here and in the accompanying reviews in this issue. The mating pheromone response pathway in a unicellular microbe, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is perhaps the best understood multicomponent signaling pathway known in any eukaryotic organism, especially at the genetic level. Furthermore, structural homologs and functional analogs of the components of the yeast pheromone response pathway are recapitulated in the signaling systems present in multicellular eukaryotes. This article emphasizes recent findings and common molecular themes for understanding the organization and regulation of MAPK-dependent signaling cascades that have emerged from biochemical and genetic analysis of the mating pheromone response pathway in yeast.

Calnexin is unrelated to molecular chaperones of the Hsp60, Hsp70 and Hsp90 families, and is further distinguished from them in that it is an integral membrane protein. One of its demonstrated functions is the retention of incorrectly or incompletely folded proteins, suggesting that calnexin is a component of the quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum.

7865884|a|STE6, a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, is a membrane protein required for the export of the a-factor mating pheromone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To initiate a study of the intracellular trafficking of STE6, we have examined its half-life and localization. We report here that STE6 is metabolically unstable in a wild-type strain, and that this instability is blocked in a pep4 mutant, suggesting that degradation of STE6 occurs in the vacuole and is dependent upon vacuolar proteases. In agreement with a model whereby STE6 is routed to the vacuole via endocytosis from the plasma membrane, we show that degradation of STE6 is substantially reduced at nonpermissive temperature in mutants defective in delivery of proteins to the plasma membrane (sec6) or in endocytosis (end3 and end4). Whereas STE6 appears to undergo constitutive internalization from the plasma membrane, as do the pheromone receptors STE2 and STE3, we show that two other proteins, the plasma membrane ATPase (PMA1) and the general amino acid permease (GAP1), are significantly more stable than STE6, indicating that rapid turnover in the vacuole is not a fate common to all plasma membrane proteins in yeast. Investigation of STE6 partial molecules (half- and quarter-molecules) indicates that both halves of STE6 contain sufficient information to mediate internalization. Examination of STE6 localization by indirect immunofluorescence indicates that STE6 is found in a punctate, possibly vesicular, intracellular pattern, distinct from the rim-staining pattern characteristic of PMA1. The punctate pattern is consistent with the view that most of the STE6 molecules present in a cell at any given moment could be en route either to or from the plasma membrane. In a pep4 mutant, STE6 is concentrated in the vacuole, providing further evidence that the vacuole is the site of STE6 degradation, while in an end4 mutant STE6 exhibits rim-staining, indicating that it can accumulate in the plasma membrane when internalization is blocked. Taken together, the results presented here suggest that STE6 first travels to the plasma membrane and subsequently undergoes endocytosis and degradation in the vacuole, with perhaps only a transient residence at the plasma membrane; an alternative model, in which STE6 circumvents the plasma membrane, is also discussed.

8641272|a|We have investigated the degradation of subunits of the trimeric Sec61p complex, a key component of the protein translocation apparatus of the ER membrane. A mutant form of Sec6lp and one of the two associated proteins (Sss1p) are selectively degraded, while the third constituent of the complex (Sbh1p) is stable. Our results demonstrate that the proteolysis of the multispanning membrane protein Sec61p is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, since it requires polyubiquitination, the presence of a membrane-bound (Ubc6) and a soluble (Ubc7) ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and a functional proteasome. The process is proposed to be specific for unassembled Sec61p and Sss1p. Thus, our results suggest that one pathway of ER degradation of abnormal or unassembled membrane proteins is initiated at the cytoplasmic side of the ER.

2839507|a|The STE2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a 431-residue protein containing seven hydrophobic segments that is thought to be an essential component of the cell-surface receptor for alpha-factor in MATa haploids. Methods were devised to prepare membrane fractions from MATa cells that retained high levels of alpha-factor binding activity, consistent with the view that the alpha-factor receptor resides in the plasma membrane. To demonstrate that the membrane constituent responsible for alpha-factor binding was the STE2 polypeptide, specific antibodies were generated and used to identify STE2-related polypeptides by radiolabeling, immunoprecipitation, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under conditions of complete solubilization, the major form of the STE2 gene product detected was a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 49,000. Affinity labeling of yeast membrane preparations by chemical cross-linking to 35S-alpha-factor indicated that a molecule of 49,000 molecular weight was the major alpha-factor-binding species. This alpha-factor-binding species was shown to be the product of the STE2 gene in three ways. First, MATa haploids carrying the STE2 gene on a multicopy plasmid overproduced alpha-factor binding activity about 15-fold. Second, MATa cells completely lacking a STE2 gene showed only nonspecific binding of alpha-factor (equivalent to the level displayed by MAT alpha haploids) and possessed no species that could be cross-linked to 35S-alpha-factor. Third, MATa cells expressing a truncated but functional STE2 gene (in which the COOH-terminal 135-hydrophilic residues were deleted) produced a protein detected by cross-linking to 35S-alpha-factor of apparent molecular weight 33,000, close to the size expected for the predicted abbreviated STE2 polypeptide. These findings demonstrate unequivocally that the STE2 gene product is the membrane component responsible for the ligand recognition function of the yeast alpha-factor receptor.

7941736|a|K1 preprotoxin is the 316 residue precursor of the K1 killer toxin secreted by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The SP beta la reporter consists of the mature, secreted form of beta-lactamase (beta la) fused to S and P, two fragments of preprotoxin. S is the N-terminal 34 residues, including the secretion signal. P, a 67 residue 'processing' segment with three sites for N-glycosylation, terminates in a Lys Arg site for cleavage by the Kex2 protease. Expression of SP beta 1a in yeast results in efficient secretion, processing by signal peptidase and glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum, producing pro beta la. Kex2 cleavage of pro beta la in the lumen of a late Golgi compartment releases beta la, which accumulates stably in culture media buffered at pH 5.8-7. The half-life of secretion is 11 min at 30 degrees C; 10-12% of the total activity in exponential-phase cells is intracellular, mostly in the form of pro beta la, indicating that transit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi is rate limiting. We have used SP beta la expression in single- and multi-copy vectors to compare the PGK, GAL1, GAL10, PHO5 and CUP1 promoters under varying nutritional conditions. In exponential-phase cells, secretion of beta la over a 40-fold range and up to several micrograms/ml was proportional to transcript level, demonstrating that SP beta la can be employed as a convenient secreted reporter of promoter function in yeast.

2017168|a|Gene fusions were constructed between Ste2, the receptor for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor, and beta la, the secreted form of beta-lactamase encoded by the bla gene of pBR322. The Ste2 and beta la components were linked by a processing fragment (P) from the yeast killer preprotoxin containing a C-terminal lysine-arginine site for cleavage by the Golgi-associated Kex2 protease. Ste2 is predicted to have a rhodopsinlike topology, with an external N terminus and seven transmembrane segments. Fusions to three of the four Ste2 domains predicted to be external resulted in beta la secretion from yeast cells. A fusion at a site just preceding the first transmembrane segment was an exception; the product was cell associated, indicating that the first 44 residues of Ste2 are insufficient to direct secretion of beta la; translocation of this domain presumably requires the downstream transmembrane segment. Expression of fusions located in two domains predicted to be cytoplasmic failed to result in beta la secretion. Following insertion of the preprotoxin signal peptide (S) between the Ste2 and P components of these cytoplasmic fusions, secretion of beta la activity occurred, which is consistent with inversion of the orientation of the beta la reporter. Conversely, insertion of S between Ste2 and P in an external fusion sharply reduced beta la secretion. Complementary information about both cytoplasmic and external domains of Ste2 was therefore provided, and most aspects of the predicted topology were confirmed. The steady-state levels of beta la detected were low, presumably because of efficient degradation of the fusions in the secretory pathway; levels, however, were easily detectable. This method should be valuable in the analysis of in vivo topologies of both homologous and foreign plasma membrane proteins expressed in yeast cells.

7822420|a|We have characterized a class of mutations in PMA1, (encoding plasma membrane ATPase) that is ideal for the analysis of membrane targeting in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This class of pma1 mutants undergoes growth arrest at the restrictive temperature because newly synthesized ATPase fails to be targeted to the cell surface. Instead, mutant ATPase is delivered to the vacuole, where it is degraded. Delivery to the vacuole occurs without previous arrival at the plasma membrane because degradation of mutant ATPase is not prevented when internalization from the cell surface is blocked. Disruption of PEP4, encoding vacuolar proteinase A, blocks ATPase degradation, but fails to restore growth because the ATPase is still improperly targeted. One of these pma1 mutants was used to select multicopy suppressors that would permit growth at the nonpermissive temperature. A novel gene, AST1, identified by this selection, suppresses several pma1 alleles defective for targeting. The basis for suppression is that multicopy AST1 causes rerouting of mutant ATPase from the vacuole to the cell surface. pma1 mutants deleted for AST1 have a synthetic growth defect at the permissive temperature, providing genetic evidence for interaction between AST1 and PMA1. Ast1 is a cytoplasmic protein that associates with membranes, and is localized to multiple compartments, including the plasma membrane. The identification of AST1 homologues suggests that Ast1 belongs to a novel family of proteins that participates in membrane traffic.

2538923|a|The ubiquitin-dependent degradation of a test protein beta-galactosidase (beta gal) is preceded by ubiquitination of beta gal. The many (from 1 to more than 20) ubiquitin moieties attached to a molecule of beta gal occur as an ordered chain of branched ubiquitin-ubiquitin conjugates in which the carboxyl-terminal Gly76 of one ubiquitin is jointed to the internal Lys48 of an adjacent ubiquitin. This multiubiquitin chain is linked to one of two specific Lys residues in beta gal. These same Lys residues have been identified by molecular genetic analysis as components of the aminoterminal degradation signal in beta gal. The experiments with ubiquitin mutated at its Lys48 residue indicate that the multiubiquitin chain in a targeted protein is essential for the degradation of the protein.

8626630|a|When glucose-starved cells are replenished with glucose, the key gluconeogenic enzyme, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), is selectively targeted from the cytosol to the yeast lysosome (vacuole) for degradation. The glucose-induced targeting of FBPase to the vacuole for degradation occurs in cells grown under a variety of metabolic conditions. Immunoelectron microscopic studies demonstrate that the uptake of FBPase by the vacuole is mediated in part by an autophagic process. FBPase can be found on the vacuolar membrane and also at the sites of membrane invaginations. Furthermore, FBPase is associated with different forms of vesicles, which are induced to accumulate inside the vacuole. We have identified peroxisomes as the organelles that are delivered to the vacuole for degradation when cells are replenished with glucose. Ultrastructural studies indicate that peroxisomes are engulfed by the vacuole by an autophagic process, leading to the destruction of whole organelles in the vacuole. Furthermore, the galactose transporter (Gal2p) is also delivered from the plasma membrane to the vacuole for degradation in response to glucose. Gal2p is delivered to the vacuole through the endocytic pathway, as mutants defective in receptor-mediated endocytosis fail to degrade Gal2p in response to glucose.

8391002|a|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae a-factor receptor (STE3) is subject to two modes of endocytosis: a constitutive process that occurs in the absence of ligand and a regulated process that is triggered by binding of ligand. Both processes result in delivery of the receptor to the vacuole for degradation. Receptor mutants deleted for part of the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain are disabled for constitutive, but not ligand-dependent internalization. Trans-acting mutants that impair constitutive endocytosis have been isolated. One of these, ren1-1, is blocked at a late step in the endocytic pathway, as receptor accumulates in a prevacuolar endosome-like compartment. REN1 is identical to VPS2, a gene required for delivery of newly synthesized vacuolar enzymes to the vacuole. Based on this identity, we suggest a model in which the transport pathways to the vacuole--the endocytic pathway and the vacuolar biogenesis pathway--merge at an intermediate endocytic compartment. As receptor also accumulates at the surface of ren1 cells, receptor may recycle from the putative endosome to the surface, or REN1 may also be required to carry out an early step in endocytosis.

8549828|a|We have recently demonstrated that the Pdr5 ATP binding cassette multidrug transporter is a short-lived protein, whose biogenesis involves cell surface targeting followed by endocytosis and delivery to the vacuole for proteolytic turnover [Egner, R., Mahé, Y., Pandjaitan, R., and Kuchler, K. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 5879-5887]. Using c-myc epitope-tagged ubiquitin, we now have shown that Pdr5 is a ubiquitinated plasma membrane protein in vivo. Ubiquitination of Pdr5 was detected in both wild type and conditional end mutants defective in endocytic vesicle formation. Likewise, the Ste6 a-factor pheromone transporter, which represents another short-lived ABC transporter whose turnover requires vacuolar proteolysis, was also found to be ubiquitinated, and ubiquitin-modified Ste6 massively accumulated in end4 mutants at the restrictive temperature. By contrast, the plasma membrane ATPase Pma1, a long-lived and metabolically very stable protein, was found not to be ubiquitinated. Our results imply a novel function for ubiquitin in protein trafficking and suggest that ubiquitination of certain short-lived plasma membrane proteins may trigger their endocytic delivery to the vacuole for proteolytic turnover.

8035826|a|The degradation of many proteins requires their prior attachment to ubiquitin. Proteolytic substrates are characteristically multiubiquitinated through the formation of ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkages. Lys-48 of ubiquitin can serve as a linkage site in the formation of such chains and is required for the degradation of some substrates of this pathway in vitro. We have characterized the recessive and dominant effects of a Lys-48-to-Arg mutant of ubiquitin (UbK48R) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although UbK48R is expected to terminate the growth of Lys-48 multiubiquitin chains and thus to exert a dominant negative effect on protein turnover, overproduction of UbK48R in wild-type cells results in only a weak inhibition of protein turnover, apparently because the mutant ubiquitin can be removed from multiubiquitin chains. Surprisingly, expression of UbK48R complements several phenotypes of polyubiquitin gene (UB14) deletion mutants. However, UbK48R cannot serve as a sole source of ubiquitin in S. cerevisiae, as evidenced by its inability to rescue the growth of ubi1 ubi2 ubi3 ubi4 quadruple mutants. When provided solely with UbK48R, cells undergo cell cycle arrest with a terminal phenotype characterized by replicated DNA, mitotic spindles, and two-lobed nuclei. Under these conditions, degradation of amino acid analog-containing proteins is severely inhibited. Thus, multiubiquitin chains containing Lys-48 linkages play a critical role in protein degradation in vivo.

8631913|a|Uracil uptake by Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by the FUR4-encoded uracil permease. This permease undergoes endocytosis and subsequent degradation in cells subjected to adverse conditions. The data presented here show that uracil permease also undergoes basal turnover under normal growth conditions. Both basal and induced turnover depend on the essential Npi1p/Rsp5p ubiquitin-protein ligase. Epitope-tagged ubiquitin variants have been used to show that uracil permease is ubiquitinated in vivo. The ubiquitin-permease conjugates that are readily demonstrated in wild type cells were barely detectable in npi1 mutant cells, indicating that uracil permease may be a physiological substrate of the Npi1p ubiquitin ligase. The lack of ubiquitination of the permease in npi1 cells resulted in an increase in active, i.e. plasma membrane-located, permease, suggesting that there is a direct relationship between ubiquitination and removal of the permease from the plasma membrane. The accumulation of ubiquitin-permease conjugates in thermosensitive act1 mutant cells, deficient in the internalization step of endocytosis is consistent with this idea. On the other hand, the degradation of uracil permease does not require a functional proteasome since the permease was not stabilized in either pre1 pre2 or cim3 and cim5 mutant cells that have impaired catalytic (pre) or regulatory (cim) proteasome subunits. In contrast, both basal and stress-stimulated turnover rates were greatly reduced in pep4 mutant cells having defective vacuolar protease activities. We therefore propose that ubiquitination of uracil permease acts as a signal for endocytosis of the protein that is subsequently degraded in the vacuole.

8545122|a|Incubation of cultured human fibroblasts with epidermal growth factor (EGF) causes a proliferative response that is mediated by the binding of the growth factor to specific cell surface receptors. One event that occurs rapidly following EGF binding is the covalent modification of the EGF receptor (EGF-R) by phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues. Here we report the identification of ubiquitination as a second form of EGF-stimulated covalent modification of the receptor. The LGF receptor was not ubiquitinated in serum-starved cells. However, treatment with EGF caused a rapid increase in EGF-R ubiquitination. In contrast, no EGF-stimulated ubiquitination was found in experiments using cells that express a mutant tyrosine kinase-negative EGF-R. Similarly, ubiquitination of the EGF-R was not observed at 4 degrees C or if the cells are depleted of intracellular K+. Together, these data establish ubiquitination as a form of EGF-stimulated covalent modification of the EGF-R.

8663607|a|We have explored the phenotypic and genetic overlap between autophagocytosis and cytoplasm to vacuole targeting in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Complementation analysis was performed with mutants in each of these groups (aut and cvt, respectively), and three complementation groups were found to overlap. Also, most of the unique aut mutants accumulated precursor aminopeptidase I in the cytoplasm, while maintaining wild type kinetics and maturation of proteins targeted to the vacuole via the secretory pathway. The majority of the non-overlapping cvt mutants were found to be at least partially defective in autophagy. Some mutants in each group, however, appear to be only marginally affected in the other phenotype, implying that these pathways only partially overlap. We propose that import of aminopeptidase I into the vacuole shares a number of components required for bulk autophagocytosis, but is made specific, saturable, and constitutive by the presence of a receptor or other interacting protein(s).

5337848|a|Approximately 400 temperature-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated. The mutants were unable to form colonies on enriched media at 36 C, but grew normally, or nearly so, at 23 C. The mutants were tested for loss of viability, change in morphology, increase in cell number, and the ability to synthesize protein, ribonucleic acid (RNA), and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) after a shift from 23 to 36 C. Mutations were found which resulted in a preferential loss of ability to carry out protein synthesis, RNA synthesis, DNA synthesis, cell division, or cell-wall formation. Diploid cells heterozygous for the temperature-sensitive mutations were constructed and tested for their ability to form colonies at 36 C. Four mutations dominant to their wild-type allele were identified.

6993497|a|Temperature-sensitive mutations that produce insensitivity to division arrest by alpha-factor, a mating pheromone, were isolated in an MATa strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and shown by complementation studies to difine eight genes. All of these mutations (designated ste) produce sterility at the restrictive temperature in MATa cells, and mutations in seven of the genes produce sterility in MAT alpha cells. In no case was the sterility associated with these mutations coorectible by including wild-type cells of the same mating type in the mating test nor did nay of the mutants inhibit mating of the wild-type cells; the defect appears to be intrinsic to the cell for mutations in each of the genes. Apparently, none of the mutants is defective exclusively in division arrest by alpha-factor, as the sterility of none is suppressed by a temperature-sensitive cdc 28 mutation (the latter imposes division arrest at the correct cell cycle stage for mating). The mutants were examined for features that are inducible in MATa cells by alpha-factor (agglutinin synthesis as well as division arrest) and for the characteristics that constitutively distinguish MATa from MAT alpha cells (a-factor production, alpha-factor destruction). ste2 Mutants are defective specifically in the two inducible properties, whereas ste4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 mutants are defective, to varying degrees, in constitutive as well as inducible aspects. Mutations in ste8 and 9 assume a polar budding pattern unlike either MATa or MAT alpha cells but characteristic of MATa/alpha cells. This study defines seven genes that function in two cell types (MATa and alpha) to control the differentiation of cell type and one gene, ste2, that functions exclusively in MATa cells to mediate responsiveness to polypeptide hormone.

8565073|a|Binding of alpha factor to Ste2p, a G protein-coupled plasma membrane receptor, activates a signal transduction pathway and stimulates endocytosis of the receptor-ligand complex. Ligand binding also induces ubiquitination of the Ste2p cytoplasmic tail. Protein ubiquitination is required for stimulated endocytosis of Ste2p, as internalization is 5- to 15-fold slower in ubc mutants that lack multiple ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. In a C-terminal truncated form of Ste2p that is rapidly ubiquitinated and endocytosed in response to ligand binding, a single lysine to arginine substitution in its cytoplasmic tail eliminates both ubiquitination and internalization. Thus, ubiquitination of Ste2p itself is required for ligand-stimulated endocytosis. We propose that ubiquitination mediates degradation of receptor-ligand complexes, not via the proteasome, but by acting as a signal for endocytosis leading to subsequent degradation in the lysosome/vacuole.

8781238|a|Secretion of proteins is initiated by their uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which possesses a proteolytic system able to degrade misfolded and nonassembled proteins. The ER degradation system was studied with yeast mutants defective in the breakdown of a mutated soluble vacuolar protein, carboxypeptidase yscY (CPY*). The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p participated in the degradation process, which was mediated by the cytosolic 26S proteasome. It is likely that CPY* entered the ER, was glycosylated, and was then transported back out of the ER lumen to the cytoplasmic side of the organelle, where it was conjugated with ubiquitin and degraded.

8995254|a|Genetic evidence suggests that the yeast STE4 and STE18 genes encode G beta and G gamma subunits, respectively, that the G betagamma complex plays a positive role in the pheromone response pathway, and that its activity is subject to negative regulation by the G alpha subunit (product of the GPA1 gene) and to positive regulation by cell-surface pheromone receptors. However, as yet there is no direct biochemical evidence for a G betagamma protein complex associated with the plasma membrane. We found that the products of the STE4 and STE18 genes are stably associated with plasma membrane as well as with internal membranes and that 30% of the protein pool is not tightly associated with either membrane fraction. A slower-migrating, presumably phosphorylated, form of Ste4p is enriched in the non-membrane fraction. The Ste4p and Ste18p proteins that had been extracted from plasma membranes with detergent were found to co-sediment as an 8 S particle under low salt conditions and as a 6 S particle in the presence of 0.25 M NaCl; the Ste18p in these fractions was precipitated with anti-Ste4p antiserum. Under the conditions of our assay, Gpa1p was not associated with either particle. The levels of Ste4p and Ste18p accumulation in mutant cells provided additional evidence for a G betagamma complex. Ste18p failed to accumulate in ste4 mutant cells, and Ste4p showed reduced levels of accumulation and an increased rate of turnover in ste18 mutant cells. The gpa1 mutant blocked stable association of Ste4p with the plasma membrane, and the ste18 mutant blocked stable association of Ste4p with both plasma membranes and internal membranes. The membrane distribution of Ste4p was unaffected by the ste2 mutation or by down-regulation of the cell-surface receptors. These results indicate that at least 40% of Ste4p and Ste18p are part of a G betagamma complex at the plasma membrane and that stable association of this complex with the plasma membrane requires the presence of G alpha.

8844145|a|The key regulatory enzyme in the gluconeogenesis pathway, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), is induced when Saccharomyces cerevisiae are grown in medium containing a poor carbon source. FBPase is targeted to the yeast vacuole for degradation when glucose-starved cells are replenished with fresh glucose. To identify genes involved in the FBPase degradation pathway, mutants that failed to degrade FBPase in response to glucose were isolated using a colony-blotting procedure. These vacuolar import and degradation-deficient (vid) mutants were placed into 20 complementation groups. They are distinct from the known sec, ups or pep mutants affecting protein secretion, vacuolar sorting and vacuolar proteolysis in that they sort CpY correctly and regulate osmotic pressure normally. Despite the presence of FBPase antigen in these mutants, FBPase is completely inactivated in all vid mutants, indicating that the c-AMP-dependent signal transduction pathway and inactivation must function properly in vid mutants. vid mutants block FBPase degradation by accumulating FBPase in the cytosol and also in small vesicles in the cytoplasm. FBPase may be targeted to small vesicles before uptake by the vacuole.

8909538|a|We have evaluated the fate of misfolded protein domains in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae secretory pathway by fusing mutant forms of the NH2-terminal domain of lambda repressor protein to the secreted protein invertase. The hybrid protein carrying the wild-type repressor domain is mostly secreted to the cell surface, whereas hybrid proteins with amino acid substitutions that cause the repressor domain to be thermodynamically unstable are retained intracellularly. Surprisingly, the retained hybrids are found in the vacuole, where the repressor moiety is degraded by vacuolar proteases. The following observations indicate that receptor-mediated recognition of the mutant repressor domain in the Golgi lumen targets these hybrid fusions to the vacuole. (a) The invertase-repressor fusions, like wild-type invertase, behave as soluble proteins in the ER lumen. (b) Targeting to the vacuole is saturable since overexpression of the hybrids carrying mutant repressor increases the fraction of fusion protein that appears at the cell surface. (c) Finally, deletion of the VPS10 gene, which encodes the transmembrane Golgi receptor responsible for targeting carboxypeptidase Y to the vacuole, causes the mutant hybrids to be diverted to the cell surface. Together these findings suggest that yeast have a salvage pathway for degradation of nonnative luminal proteins by receptor-mediated transport to the vacuole.

9001234|a|The Met tyrosine kinase receptor is a widely expressed molecule which mediates pleiotropic cellular responses following activation by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). In this communication we demonstrate that significant Met degradation is induced by HGF/SF and that this degradation can be blocked by lactacystin, an inhibitor of proteasome activity. We also show that Met is rapidly polyubiquitinated in response to ligand and that polyubiquitinated Met molecules, which are normally unstable, are stabilized by lactacystin. Both HGF/SF-induced degradation and polyubiquitination of Met were shown to be dependent on the receptor possessing intact tyrosine kinase activity. Finally, we found that a normally highly labile 55-kDa fragment of the Met receptor is stabilized by lactacystin and demonstrate that it represents a cell-associated remnant that is generated following the ligand-independent proteolytic cleavage of the Met receptor in its extracellular domain. This truncated Met molecule encompasses the kinase domain of the receptor and is itself tyrosine phosphorylated. We conclude that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a significant role in the degradation of the Met tyrosine kinase receptor as directed by ligand-dependent and -independent signals. We propose that this proteolytic pathway may be important for averting cellular transformation by desensitizing Met signaling following ligand stimulation and by eliminating potentially oncogenic fragments generated via extracellular cleavage of the Met receptor.

Haploid a cells were found to bind 35S-labeled alpha-factor, whereas haploid alpha cells and diploid a/alpha cells showed little binding. The association of alpha-factor with a cells was reversible upon dilution. Unlabeled alpha-factor competed for binding of 35S-alpha-factor; the concentration dependence for competition indicated 9 X 10(5) binding sites per cell with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3 X 10(-7) M. The rates of association (kon = 3 X 10(3) M-1 sec-1) and dissociation (koff = 9 X 10(-4) sec-1) were consistent with the equilibrium constant. The alpha-factor binding activity associated with five temperature-sensitive ste2 mutants was thermolabile, suggesting that the STE2 gene encodes the receptor for alpha-factor. In contrast, the binding activity of other temperature-sensitive mutants (ste4, ste5, ste7, ste11, and ste12) showed no thermolability.

3037311|a|Mutations in six genes that eliminate responsiveness of Saccharomyces cerevisiae a cells to alpha-factor were examined by assaying the binding of radioactively labeled alpha-factor to determine whether their lack of responsiveness was due to the absence of alpha-factor receptors. The ste2 mutants, known to be defective in the structural gene for the receptor, were found to lack receptors when grown at the restrictive temperature; these mutations probably affect the assembly of active receptors. Mutations in STE12 known to block STE2 mRNA accumulation also resulted in an absence of receptors. Mutations in STE4, 5, 7, and 11 partially reduced the number of binding sites, but this reduction was not sufficient to explain the loss of responsiveness; the products of these genes appear to affect postreceptor steps of the response pathway. As a second method of distinguishing the roles of the various STE genes, we examined the sterile mutants for suppression. Mating of the ste2-3 mutant was apparently limited by its sensitivity to alpha-factor, as its sterility was suppressed by mutation sst2-1, which leads to enhanced alpha-factor sensitivity. Sterility resulting from each of four ste4 mutations was suppressed partially by mutation sst2-1 or by mutation bar1-1 when one of three other mutations (ros1-1, ros2-1, or ros3-1) was also present. Sterility of the ste5-3 mutant was suppressed by mutation ros1-1 but not by sst2-1. The ste7, 11, and 12 mutations were not suppressed by ros1 or sst2. Our working model is that STE genes control the response to alpha-factor at two distinct steps. Defects at one step (requiring the STE2 gene are suppressed (directly or indirectly) by mutation sst2-1, whereas defects at the other step (requiring the STE5 gene) are suppressed by the ros1-1 mutation. The ste4 mutants are defective for both steps. Mutation ros1-1 was found to be allelic to cdc39-1. Map positions for genes STE2, STE12, ROS3, and FUR1 were determined.

Receptor-deficient a cells bearing a deletion of the STE2 gene were unable to internalize alpha-factor. Cultures were found to reaccumulate receptor sites following the initial period of down regulation; reaccumulation was dependent upon protein synthesis. Pheromone-resistant mutants, ste4-3 and ste5-3, retained the ability to down regulate receptors but failed to show reaccumulation. Our results suggest that alpha-factor-receptor complexes enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and that receptors are continuously lost and resynthesized in the presence of alpha-factor. We found no reduction of alpha-factor binding capacity in a cell cultures that had adapted to alpha-factor.

6397123|a|Genetic analysis has clarified the role of the major defined proteases in the life of yeast cells. The proteases of the vacuole are clearly involved in the massive proteolysis that occurs when cells are starved for nitrogen and in the (re)utilization of peptides. They appear not to be involved in any of the specific proteolyses that have been described. kex1, kex2, ste13, bar1 (sst1), and pep4 mutants have the characteristics expected of mutants defective in specific proteolytic events. Hence, the genetic attack on these specific proteolyses and the identification and characterization of the responsible proteases seem well under way and we can expect answers in the near future. The biggest lacuna in our understanding of proteolysis in yeast is the identity of the protease(s) or proteolytic system(s) involved in metabolically triggered proteolytic degradations and in housekeeping functions such as degradation of nonfunctional subunits and aberrant proteins. Genetic entries into these problems appear to be rare or difficult. Here lies the greatest challenge.

1400574|a|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae APE1 gene product, aminopeptidase I (API), is a soluble hydrolase that has been shown to be localized to the vacuole. API lacks a standard signal sequence and contains an unusual amino-terminal propeptide. We have examined the biosynthesis of API in order to elucidate the mechanism of its delivery to the vacuole. API is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is matured in a PEP4-dependent manner. The half-time for processing is approximately 45 min. The API precursor remains in the cytoplasm after synthesis and does not enter the secretory pathway. The precursor does not receive glycosyl modifications, and removal of its propeptide occurs in a sec-independent manner. Neither the precursor nor mature form of API are secreted into the extracellular fraction in vps mutants or upon overproduction, two additional characteristics of soluble vacuolar proteins that transit through the secretory pathway. Overproduction of API results in both an increase in the half-time of processing and the stable accumulation of precursor protein. These results suggest that API enters the vacuole by a posttranslational process not used by most previously studied resident vacuolar proteins and will be a useful model protein to analyze this alternative mechanism of vacuolar localization.

We used genetic and biochemical methods to analyse the involvement of N-glycosylation in the degradation of a mutant derivative of carboxypeptidase yscY in the ER of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results demonstrate that N-glycosylation of this protein is required for its degradation since an unglycosylated species is retained stably in the ER. Cells that were devoid of the ER-processing alpha 1,2-mannosidase showed reduced degradation of the glycosylated substrate protein. Disruption of CNE1, a gene encoding a putative yeast homologue for calnexin, did not exhibit any effects on the degradation of this substrate protein in vivo. Also, the alpha 1,2-mannosidase-dependent reduction in the degradation rate did not show any correlation with the function of the CNE1 gene product. Our results suggest that the ER of yeast contains a glycosylation-dependent quality control system, as has been shown for higher eukaryotic cells.

8045256|a|We are investigating the transport and turnover of the multispanning membrane protein Ste6. The Ste6 protein is a member of the ABC-transporter family and is required for the secretion of the yeast mating pheromone a-factor. In contrast to the prevailing view that Ste6 is a plasma membrane protein, we found that Ste6 is mainly associated with internal membranes and not with the cell surface. Fractionation and immunofluorescence data are compatible with a Golgi localization of Ste6. Despite its mostly intracellular localization, the Ste6 protein is in contact with the cell surface, as demonstrated by the finding that Ste6 accumulates in the plasma membrane in endocytosis mutants. The Ste6 protein which accumulates in the plasma membrane in endocytosis mutants is ubiquitinated. Ste6 is thus the second protein in yeast besides MAT alpha 2 for which ubiquitination has been demonstrated. Ste6 is a very unstable protein (half-life 13 min) which is stabilized approximately 3-fold in a ubc4 ubc5 mutant, implicating the ubiquitin system in the degradation of Ste6. The strongest stabilizing effect on Ste6 is, however, observed in the vacuolar pep4 mutant (half-life > 2 h), suggesting that most of Ste6 is degraded in the vacuole. Secretory functions are required for efficient degradation of Ste6, indicating that Ste6 enters the secretory pathway and is transported to the vacuole by vesicular carriers.

2842059|a|STE2 encodes a component of the S. cerevisiae alpha-pheromone receptor that is essential for induction of physiological changes associated with mating. Analysis of C-terminal truncation mutants of STE2 demonstrated that the essential sequences for ligand binding and signal transduction are included within a region containing seven putative transmembrane domains. However, truncation of the C-terminal 105 amino acids of the receptor resulted in a 4- to 5-fold increase in cell-surface pheromone binding sites, a 10-fold increase in pheromone sensitivity, a defect in recovery of cell division after pheromone treatment, and a defect in pheromone-induced morphogenesis. Overproduction of STE2 resulted in about a 6-fold increase in alpha-pheromone binding capacity but did not produce the other phenotypes associated with the ste2-T326 mutant receptor. We conclude that the C-terminus of the receptor is responsible for one aspect of cellular adaptation to pheromone that is distinct from adaptation controlled by the SST2 gene, for decreasing the stability of the receptor, and for some aspect of cellular morphogenesis.

7852314|a|Uptake of inositol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a specific inositol permease encoded by the ITR1 gene. Removal of inositol from the growth medium results in an increase in ITR1 mRNA abundance. The increase in ITR1 mRNA is accompanied by an increase in de novo synthesis of the Itr1 permease leading to an increased capacity for uptake. When inositol is added to the growth medium inactivation of uptake activity occurs, and both transcription of ITR1 and uptake activity are repressed to a basal level of function. The transcriptional regulation of ITR1 depends on the INO2, INO4, and OPI1 genes. In addition, repression is also achieved by regulation of ITR1 expression at the post-translational level. In this study, we show that there is a change in the stability of the Itr1 permease after the addition of inositol to the growth medium. Immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against an epitope attached to the Itr1 permease showed that the addition of inositol causes a dramatic increase in the rate of degradation of the permease. After the repressed (basal) level is achieved, turnover continues to be rapid. The increased rate of degradation was also observed in strains with mutations that block conjugation to ubiquitin. Degradation was not observed in strains defective in the END3/END4 endocytic pathway or in the production of vacuolar proteases (PEP4). Thus, inactivation of the Itr1 permease is accompanied by endocytic internalization followed by degradation in the vacuole. Inactivation may be a separate process that precedes and signals endocytic degradation. Since the end3/end4 mutations did not affect uptake activity under derepressed conditions, endocytosis is not required for normal inositol uptake.

Protein degradation was mediated by two different proteases: (i) the m-AAA protease, a protease complex consisting of multiple copies of the ATP-dependent metallopeptidases Yta1Op (Afg3p) and Yta12p (Rcalp); and (ii) by Ymelp (Ytallp) that also is embedded in the inner membrane. Ymelp, highly homologous to Yta1Op and Yta12p, forms a complex of approximately 850 kDa in the inner membrane and exerts ATP-dependent metallopeptidase activity. While the m-AAA protease exposes catalytic sites to the mitochondrial matrix, Ymelp is active in the intermembrane space. The Ymelp complex was therefore termed 'i-AAA protease'. Analysis of the proteolytic fragments indicated cleavage of the model polypeptide at the inner and outer membrane surface and within the membrane-spanning domain. Thus, two AAA proteases with their catalytic sites on opposite membrane surfaces constitute a novel proteolytic system for the degradation of membrane proteins in mitochondria.

1385813|a|Yeast vacuolar acidification-defective (vph) mutants were identified using the pH-sensitive fluorescence of 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (Preston, R. A., Murphy, R. F., and Jones, E. W. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 7027-7031). Vacuoles purified from yeast bearing the vph1-1 mutation had no detectable bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity or ATP-dependent proton pumping. The peripherally bound nucleotide-binding subunits of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (60 and 69 kDa) were no longer associated with vacuolar membranes yet were present in wild type levels in yeast whole cell extracts. The VPH1 gene was cloned by complementation of the vph1-1 mutation and independently cloned by screening a lambda gt11 expression library with antibodies directed against a 95-kDa vacuolar integral membrane protein. Deletion disruption of the VPH1 gene revealed that the VPH1 gene is not essential for viability but is required for vacuolar H(+)-ATPase assembly and vacuolar acidification. VPH1 encodes a predicted polypeptide of 840 amino acid residues (molecular mass 95.6 kDa) and contains six putative membrane-spanning regions. Cell fractionation and immunodetection demonstrate that Vph1p is a vacuolar integral membrane protein that co-purifies with vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity. Multiple sequence alignments show extensive homology over the entire lengths of the following four polypeptides: Vph1p, the 116-kDa polypeptide of the rat clathrin-coated vesicles/synaptic vesicle proton pump, the predicted polypeptide encoded by the yeast gene STV1 (Similar To VPH1, identified as an open reading frame next to the BUB2 gene), and the TJ6 mouse immune suppressor factor.

8636208|a|To investigate the mechanisms of ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), this process was reconstituted in vitro. Established procedures for post-translational translocation of radiolabeled prepro-alpha factor into isolated yeast microsomes were modified to inhibit glycosylation and to include a posttranslocation "chase" incubation period to monitor degradation. Glycosylation was inhibited with a glyco-acceptor peptide to compete for core carbohydrates, or by using a radio-labeled alpha factor precursor that had been genetically engineered to eliminate all three glycosylation sites. Inhibition of glycosylation led to the production of unglycosylated pro-alpha factor (p alpha F), a processed form of the alpha factor precursor shown to be a substrate of ERAD in vivo. With this system, both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of pro-alpha factor were stable throughout a 90-min chase incubation. However, the addition of cytosol to the chase incubation reaction induced a selective and rapid degradation of p alpha F. These results directly reflect the behavior of alpha factor precursor in vivo; i.e., p alpha F is a substrate for ERAD, while glycosylated pro-alpha factor is not. Heat inactivation and trypsin treatment of cytosol, as well as addition of ATP gamma S to the chase incubations, led to a stabilization of p alpha F. ERAD was observed in sec12 microsomes, indicating that export of p alpha F via transport vesicles was not required. Furthermore, p alpha F but not glycosylated pro-alpha factor was found in the supernatant of the chase incubation reactions, suggesting a specific transport system for this ERAD substrate. Finally, the degradation of p alpha F was inhibited when microsomes from a yeast strain containing a disrupted calnexin gene were examined. Together, these results indicate that cytosolic protein factor(s), ATP hydrolysis, and calnexin are required for ER-associated protein degradation in yeast, and suggest the cytosol as the site for degradation.

8636025|a|The addition of glucose to maltose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells causes a rapid and irreversible loss of the ability to transport maltose, resulting both from the repression of transcription of the maltose permease gene and from the inactivation of maltose permease. The latter is referred to as glucose-induced inactivation or catabolite inactivation. We describe an analysis of this process in a maltose-fermenting strain expressing a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged allele of MAL61, encoding maltose permease. The transfer of maltose-induced cells expressing the Mal61/HA protein to rich medium containing glucose produces a decrease in maltose transport rates which is paralleled by a decrease in Mal61/HA maltose permease protein levels. In nitrogen starvation medium, glucose produces a biphasic inactivation, i.e., an initial, rapid loss in transport activity (inhibition) followed by a slower decrease in transport activity, which correlates with a decrease in the amount of maltose permease protein (proteolysis). The inactivation in both rich and nitrogen-starved media results from a decrease in Vmax with no apparent change in Km. Using strains carrying mutations in END3, REN1(VPS2), PEP4, and PRE1 PRE2, we demonstrate that the proteolysis of Mal61/HAp is dependent on endocytosis and vacuolar proteolysis and is independent of the proteosome. Moreover, we show that the Mal61/HA maltose permease is present in differentially phosphorylated forms.

16453635|a|The nucleotide sequences of STE2 and STE3, cell type-specific sterile genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were determined; major open reading frames encode 431 and 470 amino acids, respectively. STE2 and STE3 proteins seem to be folded in a similar fashion and are likely to be membrane-bound. Both consist of seven hydrophobic segments in each NH(2)-terminal region with a long hydrophilic domain in each COOH-terminal region. However, the two putative gene products do not exhibit extensive sequence homology. The STE2 protein has no obvious hydrophobic signal peptide; the NH(2) terminus of the STE3 protein might serve as a signal peptide. The STE2 transcript, 1.7 kb, was detected in MATa strains but not in MATalpha strains, while the STE3 transcript, also 1.7 kb, was detected only in MATalpha cells. In STE2, two canonical TATA sequences are located 18 and 27 bp upstream of the mRNA start site, which has been mapped 32 bp before the initiator ATG codon, while STE3 contains a similar sequence (TATAGA), which is preceded by a long AT sequence, 140 bp upstream of the initiator ATG codon. Transcription of STE2 in a cells seems to be enhanced by exogenous alpha-factor.

8670854|a|The cell surface protein repertoire needs to be regulated in response to changes in the extracellular environment. In this study, we investigate protein turnover of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane copper transporter Ctr1p, in response to a change in extra-cellular copper levels. As Ctr1p mediates high affinity uptake of copper into the cell, modulation of its expression is expected to be involved in copper homeostasis. We demonstrate that Ctr1p is a stable protein when cells are grown in low concentrations of copper, but that exposure of cells to high concentrations of copper (10 microM) triggers degradation of cell surface Ctr1p. This degradation appears to be specific for Ctr1p and does not occur with another yeast plasma membrane protein tested. Internalization of some Ctr1p can be seen when cells are exposed to copper. However, yeast mutant strains defective in endocytosis (end3, end4 and chc1-ts) and vacuolar degradation (pep4) exhibit copper-dependent Ctr1p degradation, indicating that internalization and delivery to the vacuole is not the principal mechanism responsible for degradation. In addition, a variant Ctr1p with a deletion in the cytosolic tail is not internalized upon exposure of cells to copper, but is nevertheless degraded. These observations indicate that proteolysis at the plasma membrane most likely explains copper-dependent turnover of Ctr1p and point to the existence of a novel pathway in yeast for plasma membrane protein turnover.

7814381|a|We have used a polymerase chain reaction strategy to identify in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes of the mammalian calnexin/calreticulin family, and we have identified and isolated a single gene, CNE1. The protein predicted from the CNE1 DNA sequence shares some of the motifs with calnexin and calreticulin, and it is 24% identical and 31% similar at the amino acid level with mammalian calnexin. On the basis of its solubility in detergents and its lack of extraction from membranes by 2.5 M urea, high salt, and sodium carbonate at pH 11.5, we have established that Cne1p is an integral membrane protein. However, unlike calnexins, the predicted carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning domain of Cne1p terminates directly. Furthermore, based on its changed mobility from 76 to 60 kDa after endoglycosidase H digestion Cne1p was shown to be N-glycosylated. Localization of the Cne1p protein by differential and analytical subcellular fractionation as well as by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that it was exclusively located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), despite the lack of known ER retention motifs. Although six Ca(2+)-binding proteins were detected in the ER fractions, they were all soluble proteins, and Ca2+ binding activity has not been detected for Cne1p. Disruption of the CNE1 gene did not lead to inviable cells or to gross effects on the levels of secreted proteins such as alpha-pheromone or acid phosphatase. However, in CNE1 disrupted cells, there was an increase of cell-surface expression of an ER retained temperature-sensitive mutant of the alpha-pheromone receptor, ste2-3p, and also an increase in the secretion of heterologously expressed mammalian alpha 1-antitrypsin. Hence, Cne1p appears to function as a constituent of the S. cerevisiae ER protein quality control apparatus.

8392878|a|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-pheromone receptor, a polytopic, G protein-coupled, membrane protein, is internalized after binding of alpha-factor. Mutational analysis suggested that the first 39 residues of the receptor's cytoplasmic tail carries sufficient information for internalization. A point mutation in one of these 39 residues, K337 to R337, renders the receptor nonfunctional for endocytosis. Other residues, D335 and S338, contribute to the efficiency of internalization. When the sequence DAKSS is added onto a severely truncated receptor, endocytosis of the receptor is restored, showing that this sequence functions to mediate or to signal interaction with the endocytic machinery. Analysis of pheromone response and recovery in strains expressing mutant receptors suggests that receptor internalization is not important for response but contributes to recovery from pheromone.

8707846|a|The a-factor receptor (Ste3p) is one of two pheromone receptors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that enable the cell-cell communication of mating. In this report, we show that this receptor is subject to two distinct covalent modifications-phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Phosphorylation, evident on the unstimulated receptor, increases upon challenge by the receptor's ligand, a-factor. We suggest that this phosphorylation likely functions in the adaptive, negative regulation of receptor activity. Removal of phosphorylation by phosphatase treatment uncovered two phosphatase-resistant modifications identified as ubiquitination using a myc-epitope-tagged ubiquitin construct. Ste3p undergoes rapid, ligand-independent turnover that depends on vacuolar proteases and also on transport of the receptor from surface to vacuole (i.e., endocytosis) (Davis, N.G., J.L.Horecka, and G.F. Sprague, Jr., 1993 J. Cell Biol. 122:53-65). An end4 mutation, isolated for its defect in the endocytic uptake of alpha-factor pheromone (Raths, S., J. Rohrer, F. Crausaz, and H. Riezman. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 120:55-65), blocks constitutive endocytosis of the a-factor receptor, yet fails to block ubiquitination of the receptor. In fact, both phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the surfacebound receptor were found to increase, suggesting that these modifications may occur normally while the receptor is at the cell surface. In a mutant strain constructed to allow for depletion of ubiquitin, the level of receptor ubiquitination was found to be substantially decreased. Correlated with this was an impairment of receptor degradative turnover-receptor half-life that is normally approximately 20 min at 30 degrees C was increased to approximately 2 h under these ubiquitin-depletion conditions. Furthermore, surface residency, normally of short duration in wild-type cells (terminated by endocytosis to the vacuole), was found to be prolonged; the majority of the receptor protein remained surface localized fully 2 h after biosynthesis. Thus, the rates of a-factor receptor endocytosis and consequent vacuolar turnover depend on the available level of ubiquitin in the cell. In cells mutant for two E2 activities, i.e., ubc4 delta ubc5 delta cells, the receptor was found to be substantially less ubiquitinated, and in addition, receptor turnover was slowed, suggesting that Ubc4p and Ubc5p may play a role in the recognition of the receptor protein as substrate for the ubiquitin system. In addition to ligand-independent uptake, the a-factor receptor also undergoes a ligand-dependent form of endocytosis (Davis, N.G., J.L. Horecka, and G.F. Sprague, Jr. 1993. J. Cell. Biol. 122:53-65). Concurrent with ligand-dependent uptake, we now show that the receptor undergoes ligand-induced ubiquitination, suggesting that receptor ubiquitination may function in the ligand-dependent endocytosis of the a-factor receptor as well as in its constitutive endocytosis. To account for these findings, we propose a model wherein the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to surface receptor triggers endocytic uptake.

3517855|a|Using an immunological screening procedure that allows the detection of yeast cells aberrantly secreting vacuolar proteins, we have isolated a cloned DNA fragment containing the structural gene for the vacuolar enzyme proteinase A (PrA; EC 3.4.23.6). A large portion of PrA is misdirected to the cell surface in cells harboring the PrA structural gene on a multicopy plasmid. This mislocalized PrA traverses the late stages of the secretory pathway and differs slightly in apparent molecular weight from the vacuolar form. A deletion in the genomic copy of the PrA structural gene eliminates immunoreactive PrA as well as the enzymatic activities of at least three other vacuolar hydrolases. In the case of the vacuolar enzyme carboxypeptidase Y (EC 3.4.16.1), the lack of activity is due to the absence of proteolytic activation of the zymogen. Thus, PrA may be required for in vivo processing of a number of yeast vacuolar hydrolases.

1568250|a|Secretory proteins are segregated from cytosolic proteins by their translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A modified secretory protein trapped during translocation across the ER membrane can be crosslinked to two previously identified proteins, Sec61p and BiP (Kar2p). The dependence of this cross-linking upon proteins and small molecules was examined. Mutations in SEC62 and SEC63 decrease the ability of Sec61p to be cross-linked to the secretory polypeptide trapped in translocation. ATP is also required for interaction of Sec61p with the secretory protein. Three kar2 alleles display defective translocation in vitro. Two of these alleles also decrease the ability of Sec61p to be cross-linked to the secretory protein. The third allele, while exhibiting a severe translocation defect, does not affect the interaction of Sec61p with the secretory protein. These results suggest that Sec61p is directly involved in translocation and that BiP acts at two stages of the translocation cycle.

7935439|a|When Saccharomyces cerevisiae a cells bind alpha-factor pheromone, the ligand is internalized and its binding sites are lost from the cell surface in a time-, energy-, and temperature-dependent manner. This report presents direct evidence for alpha-factor-induced internalization of cell surface receptors. First, membrane fractionation on Renografin density gradients indicated that the alpha-factor receptors were predominantly found in the plasma membrane peak before alpha-factor treatment and then appeared in membranes of lesser buoyant density after alpha-factor exposure. Second, receptors were susceptible to cleavage by extracellular proteases before alpha-factor treatment and then became resistant to proteolysis after exposure to pheromone, consistent with the transit of receptors from the cell surface to an internal compartment. The median transit time in both assays was approximately 8 min. The ultimate target of the internalized receptors was identified as the vacuole, since the membranes containing internalized receptors cofractionated with vacuolar membranes, since the turnover of receptors was stimulated by alpha-factor exposure, and since receptor degradation was blocked in a pep4 mutant that is deficient for vacuolar proteases. The carboxy-terminal domain of the receptor that is required for ligand internalization was also found to be essential for endocytosis of the receptor. A receptor mutant, ste2-L236H, which is defective for pheromone response but capable of ligand internalization, was found to be proficient for receptor endocytosis. Hence, separate structural features of the receptor appear to specify its signal transduction and internalization activities.

7749322|a|An understanding of how an extracellular stimulus causes changes in cell growth is emerging from the study of four signal transduction pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the pheromone-response, pseudohyphal differentiation, osmolarity-response, and protein kinase C activated pathways. Each of these pathways contains at its core a distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Biochemical and molecular studies have determined the functional order of the kinases in the pheromone-response pathway and have suggested that they are organized into a complex by a protein scaffold. The cell surface sensor system for the osmolarity-response pathway has been identified. It shows striking similarity to bacterial two-component sensor-responder systems. Finally, components that integrate information from these pathways and communicate it to cell growth regulators have been revealed.

Complementation analysis of yeast mutants defective for cytoplasm-to-vacuole protein targeting (cvt) and autophagy (apg) revealed seven overlapping complementation groups between these two sets of mutants. In addition, all 14 apg complementation groups are defective in the delivery of API to the vacuole. Similarly, the majority of nonoverlapping cvt complementation groups appear to be at least partially defective in autophagy. Kinetic analyses of protein delivery rates indicate that autophagic protein uptake is induced by nitrogen starvation, whereas Cvt is a constitutive biosynthetic pathway. However, the machinery governing Cvt is affected by nitrogen starvation as targeting defects resulting from API overexpression can be rescued by induction of autophagy.

8791448|a|Vesicle-mediated membrane traffic has long been considered to be a constitutive process that is not burdened by layers of regulation. This contrasts with transmembrane signalling systems at the plasma membrane which relay information (i.e. extracellular stimuli) from the cell surface to the cytoplasm via a myriad of different protein-protein interactions and second messenger cascades. An accumulation of recent evidence, however, now suggests that signal-transduction pathways also play a critical role in the regulation of protein and membrane trafficking. In particular, the analysis of the signalling pathways initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases at the plasma membrane has yielded new insights into the molecular mechanisms of endocytosis. In addition, recent evidence has suggested potential new roles for two previously characterized vesicle coat proteins in a membrane traffic route that is regulated via cell surface receptor signalling.

Members of this enzyme family are involved in strikingly diverse cellular functions: UBC2 (RAD6) is central to DNA repair, UBC3 (CDC34) is involved in cell cycle control. We have cloned the genes for two novel ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, UBC4 and UBC5, from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These enzymes mediate selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. UBC4 and UBC5 are closely related in sequence and complementing in function. Expression of UBC4 and UBC5 genes is heat inducible. UBC4 and UBC5 enzymes generate high mol. wt ubiquitin-protein conjugates in vivo consistent with previous studies which suggested that attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to proteolytic substrates is required for their selective degradation. UBC4 and UBC5 enzymes comprise a major part of total ubiquitin-conjugation activity in stressed cells. Turnover of short-lived proteins and canavanyl-peptides but not of long-lived proteins is markedly reduced in ubc4ubc5 mutants. Loss of UBC4 and UBC5 activity impairs cell growth, leads to inviability at elevated temperatures or in the presence of an amino acid analog, and induces the stress response.

Here we report the identification of an integral membrane ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. This enzyme, UBC6, localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with the catalytic domain facing the cytosol. ubc6 loss-of-function mutants suppress the protein translocation defect caused by a mutation in SEC61, which encodes a key component of a multisubunit protein translocation apparatus of the ER. The expression of the sec61 mutant phenotype requires both the activity of UBC6 and its localization at the ER membrane. This suggests that UBC6 may mediate selective degradation of ER membrane proteins and that the protein translocation defect of sec61 may be caused by proteolysis of components of a structurally distorted mutant translocation apparatus.

8670885|a|The ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation system has recently been implicated in downregulation of signal transducing receptors. Growth hormone receptor (GHR) cDNA was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, which exhibit a temperature-sensitive defect in ubiquitin conjugation (CHO-ts20), as well as into wild-type cells (CHO-E36). Upon binding of growth hormone (GH), two GHR polypeptides dimerize and initiate signal transduction. In CHO-E36 and in CHO-ts20 at the permissive temperature the GHR was ubiquitinated and degraded in a GH-dependent fashion. However, at the non-permissive temperature in CHO-ts20 cells, neither GH-dependent uptake nor degradation of the GHR was observed, while in CHO-E36 cells both GHR uptake and degradation were accelerated. Incubation of CHO-E36 cells with inhibitors of endosomal/lysosomal function (NH4Cl, bafilomycin A1) markedly reduced ligand-induced GHR degradation. Our results indicate that a functional ubiquitin conjugating system is required for GH-induced endocytosis and that degradation of both the exoplasmic and cytoplasmic portions of the GHR occurs within the endosomal/lysosomal compartment.

1400575|a|For determination of the physiological role and mechanism of vacuolar proteolysis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutant cells lacking proteinase A, B, and carboxypeptidase Y were transferred from a nutrient medium to a synthetic medium devoid of various nutrients and morphological changes of their vacuoles were investigated. After incubation for 1 h in nutrient-deficient media, a few spherical bodies appeared in the vacuoles and moved actively by Brownian movement. These bodies gradually increased in number and after 3 h they filled the vacuoles almost completely. During their accumulation, the volume of the vacuolar compartment also increased. Electron microscopic examination showed that these bodies were surrounded by a unit membrane which appeared thinner than any other intracellular membrane. The contents of the bodies were morphologically indistinguishable from the cytosol; these bodies contained cytoplasmic ribosomes, RER, mitochondria, lipid granules and glycogen granules, and the density of the cytoplasmic ribosomes in the bodies was almost the same as that of ribosomes in the cytosol. The diameter of the bodies ranged from 400 to 900 nm. Vacuoles that had accumulated these bodies were prepared by a modification of the method of Ohsumi and Anraku (Ohsumi, Y., and Y. Anraku. 1981. J. Biol. Chem. 256:2079-2082). The isolated vacuoles contained ribosomes and showed latent activity of the cytosolic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. These results suggest that these bodies sequestered the cytosol in the vacuoles. We named these spherical bodies "autophagic bodies." Accumulation of autophagic bodies in the vacuoles was induced not only by nitrogen starvation, but also by depletion of nutrients such as carbon and single amino acids that caused cessation of the cell cycle. Genetic analysis revealed that the accumulation of autophagic bodies in the vacuoles was the result of lack of the PRB1 product proteinase B, and disruption of the PRB1 gene confirmed this result. In the presence of PMSF, wild-type cells accumulated autophagic bodies in the vacuoles under nutrient-deficient conditions in the same manner as did multiple protease-deficient mutants or cells with a disrupted PRB1 gene. As the autophagic bodies disappeared rapidly after removal of PMSF from cultures of normal cells, they must be an intermediate in the normal autophagic process. This is the first report that nutrient-deficient conditions induce extensive autophagic degradation of cytosolic components in the vacuoles of yeast cells.

388439|a|A method has been devised for the electrophoretic transfer of proteins from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose sheets. The method results in quantitative transfer of ribosomal proteins from gels containing urea. For sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, the original band pattern was obtained with no loss of resolution, but the transfer was not quantitative. The method allows detection of proteins by autoradiography and is simpler than conventional procedures. The immobilized proteins were detectable by immunological procedures. All additional binding capacity on the nitrocellulose was blocked with excess protein; then a specific antibody was bound and, finally, a second antibody directed against the first antibody. The second antibody was either radioactively labeled or conjugated to fluorescein or to peroxidase. The specific protein was then detected by either autoradiography, under UV light, or by the peroxidase reaction product, respectively. In the latter case, as little as 100 pg of protein was clearly detectable. It is anticipated that the procedure will be applicable to analysis of a wide variety of proteins with specific reactions or ligands.

8625414|a|Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) down-regulates expression of MHC class I products by selective proteolysis. A single HCMV gene, US11, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident type-I transmembrane glycoprotein, is sufficient to cause this effect. In US11+cells, MHC class I molecules are core-glycosylated and therefore inserted into the ER. They are degraded with a half-time of less than 1 min. A full length breakdown intermediate that has lost the single N-linked glycan in an N-glycanase-catalyzed reaction transiently accumulates in cells exposed to the protease inhibitors LLnL, Cbz-LLL, and lactacystin, identifying the proteasome as a key protease. Subcellular fractionation experiments show this intermediate to be cytosolic. Thus, US11 dislocates newly synthesized class I molecules from the ER to the cytosol, where they are acted upon by an N-glycanase and the proteasome.

Molecular genetic approaches with budding yeast have been instrumental in elucidating the components of these complex signaling pathways and the inter-relationships among these components. Recent progress has revealed pathways that link extracellular signals with the machinery governing both cell cycle progression and morphogenesis. The nature of the interface between nutritional and checkpoint signals with the cell cycle apparatus is just now emerging.

2527549|a|Forty-three patients with large (greater than or equal to 4 cm) but operable carcinoma of the breast have been treated by endocrine manipulation before definitive local surgery. This has allowed the study of the relationship between response to therapy and pretreatment oestrogen receptor (ER) concentration, as measured by a dextran-coated charcoal adsorption method. Premenopausal patients (17) were treated by surgical (4) or medical (13) oophorectomy. Post-menopausal patients (26) received either tamoxifen (10) or an aromatase inhibitor (16). Response was assessed from statistical analysis of the changes in tumour size. On completion of 12 weeks of endocrine therapy, there was significant regression of tumour size in 18 of the 43 patients. All 18 patients had tumours with ER concentrations of greater than or equal to 20 fmol mg-1 cytosol protein. Conversely all patients except one progressing on treatment had tumours with ER concentrations of less than 20 fmol mg-1 cytosol protein. This relationship applied for both premenopausal and post-menopausal patients. The overall response rate of patients with tumours of ER concentration greater than or equal to 20 fmol mg-1 cytosol protein was 60%.

1827031|a|Eighty-eight patients presenting with operable breast cancer of 4 cm or greater in diameter (T2, T3, N0, N1, M0) have received primary systemic therapy. Response was assessed following 12 weeks of systemic therapy by linear regression analysis of changes in tumour volume. Definitive locoregional surgery (mastectomy n = 82, wide local excision n = 6) was performed on completion of systemic therapy (3-6 months). Response was observed in 24 (39%) of the 61 patients who received endocrine therapy; all 24 had tumours with an oestrogen receptor (ER) concentration of greater than or equal to 20 fmol mb-1 cytosol protein. Cytotoxic therapy was reserved for patients with tumours of ER concentration less than 20 fmol mg-1 cytosol protein (n = 27) or when endocrine therapy had failed (n = 20). Response was observed in 34 patients (72%). The overall survival rate at 3 years was 86%, with 81% remaining free from local relapse. We propose that the treatment policy outlined in this paper should now be tested against orthodox management by controlled randomised trial.

2402015|a|In 165 women with breast cancer who were candidates for mastectomy because the largest diameter of the tumor was 3 cm or more, we administered primary chemotherapy in the attempt to substitute conservative for mutilating surgery. We then systematically quantitated tumor reduction by clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic evaluations. Five consecutive groups of 33 patients received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF); fluorouracil, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cyclophosphamide (FAC); or fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC). The regimens for the five groups were as follows: group 1, three cycles of CMF; group 2, four cycles of CMF; group 3, three cycles of FAC; group 4, four cycles of FAC; and group 5, three cycles of FEC. In response to primary chemotherapy, 157 of the 161 assessable patients showed measurable tumor shrinkage; progressive disease was documented in four. Tumor shrinkage to less than 3 cm was documented in 127 (81%) of the 157 women subjected to surgery, thus allowing a breast-saving procedure, rather than modified radical mastectomy, in these 127 women. Histopathologic complete remission was documented in seven patients. Tumor response was unrelated to age, menopausal status, DNA content (ploidy), [3H]thymidine-labeling index, drug combination used, or number of treatment cycles in excess of three. The degree of response was inversely proportional to the initial tumor size, and the frequency of response was greater in receptor-negative tumors. Severe vomiting and hair loss were less frequent with CMF than with anthracycline-containing regimens, and the frequency of severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was minimal. Our results challenge the classical indication for primary mastectomy by showing that use of full-dose primary chemotherapy, sequentially combined with conservative surgery and radiation, can offer an effective and safe alternative to women concerned about the preservation of body integrity.

7670678|a|Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery or radiation therapy, or both, has become the treatment of choice for patients with large-sized resectable carcinoma of the breast in whom mastectomy is the conventional option. Since tumor regression before surgery is considered a favorable prognostic factor, there is still controversy regarding the need to perform an axillary dissection after a good response to systemic induction treatment.Between February 1990 and December 1993, we conducted a prospective study of 56 consecutive patients receiving high-dose anthracycline-based preoperative chemotherapy for large but potentially resectable carcinoma of the breast. Patients who had a good clinical response to induction systemic treatment received the same chemotherapy in the adjuvant phase, while those whose response was less than optimal received alternative adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. A multivariate analysis was made to evaluate the relative influence on disease-free survival rates of 11 clinicopathologic and treatment-related variables, including clinical response to primary chemotherapy, primary pathological (p-T) staging, and the number of metastatic lymph nodes.At a median follow-up period of 36 months, only the number of metastatic lymph nodes was found to be an independent predictor of relapse. Clinical response to systemic induction treatment and p-T staging did not correlate with prognosis. In the group of patients with axillary lymph node involvement, those who did not respond to preoperative chemotherapy showed a lower relapse rate compared with those who achieved an objective response.These findings suggest that axillary lymphadenectomy should be considered an important component of the combined modality therapy for patients with large-sized resectable carcinoma of the breast in order to identify subgroups of patients that may benefit from alternative treatments in the adjuvant setting.

1524919|a|126 patients with non-inflammatory operable breast cancer, who otherwise would have undergone modified radical mastectomy (MRM), were treated by induction chemotherapy. Before treatment, every patient had a local and general assessment, and pathological or cytological evidence of malignancy. Patients received, every 3 weeks, the same treatment with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil (AVCF); methotrexate was added in 80 cases (AVCFM). Tumour shrinkage greater than 50% was documented in 105 (83%) of the 126 women. A higher objective response rate was obtained in aneuploid or high S phase tumours, especially in the patients treated with methotrexate. After chemotherapy, 41 patients were then treated by radiotherapy alone after complete or sub-complete response; 64 had a residual tumour that could be treated by conservative surgery and radiotherapy. Only 19 had MRM and radiotherapy. Histopathological complete remission was documented in 1 case; isolated residual tumour cells were found in 5 patients. Thus primary chemotherapy enhanced the possibility of breast conservation in up to 83% of the cases in a series in which most would have been otherwise subjected to a MRM because of tumour size.

8387066|a|The traditional surgical treatment for operable breast cancer larger than 3 cm is mastectomy. In order to avoid mutilating surgery, we administered primary chemotherapy to 80 patients with operable non metastatic large breast cancer T2 > 3 cm and T3, N0-N1. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the breast-conserving rate induced by this treatment strategy and determine if it is a safe alternative for women with locally advanced breast carcinomas that are responders to an induction chemotherapy.The mean age was 50.1 years. Forty-three patients were T2 > 3 cm, 37 were T3. Twenty-six were N0 and 54 were N1. Mean tumor size was 5.4 cm. Patients were treated with three courses of the MVCF regimen (Mitoxantrone, Vindesin, Cyclophosphamide, and 5 Fluorouracil) every 4 weeks and then with a radiosurgical combination.The overall response rate to induction chemotherapy was 51% with 17.5% complete tumor regression. Twenty-one percent of the patients developed grade 3 or 4 chemotherapy toxic effects, all acceptable and reversible. Breast-conserving treatment was feasible in 42.5% (34/80). Twenty patients (25%) were treated with a radiosurgical combination (tumorectomy+radiation therapy), 14 (17.5%) with radiotherapy alone (external irradiation and brachytherapy). Age, tumor stage, histology, hormonal status, hormonal receptors rate had no influence on the frequency of the observed regressions. Isolated recurrences occurred in five patients, two conservatively treated and three treated with mastectomy. Metastatic relapses were observed in 20 patients (12% in the responders and 38.5% in the non responders to chemotherapy) (p < 0.02). Five-year actuarial survival was 73% and was significantly better for responders to the induction treatment.These results suggest that primary chemotherapy and radiosurgical breast conserving treatment is a safe alternative to mastectomy for patients with locally advanced operable breast cancer. The long-term benefit of this strategy must be evaluated in well designed controlled trials.

1998835|a|This is the first of a series of papers in which we shall explore some insights into the biological changes which accompany the treatment of human tumours which may be obtained through estimation of volume changes in relation to treatment. We have adopted a working hypothesis that regression slopes reflect the composition of individual tumours and, indirectly, their intrinsic growth rate rather than the effectiveness of treatment. The breast has proved to be a suitable site for measurement and our interpretation of the results has led to the development of a new style of management for carcinoma of the breast: measurement based sequential therapy (MBST). In this paper the method of measurement and detailed statistical evaluation of the quality of the data from 262 patients (263 tumours) is presented. Exponential regression lines have been fitted to describe volume changes in relation to treatment by radiation, chemotherapy and hormones. A simple classification of steepness of slopes is introduced.

8439511|a|This study aimed to investigate the effect of tamoxifen on breast tumour levels of oestrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR) and proliferation as defined by the Ki67 antibody. A group of primary breast cancer patients was randomised to receive either tamoxifen (n = 59) or placebo (n = 44) treatment in the interval between clinic and surgery (median 21 days). Frozen sections of breast tumour biopsies obtained before and after treatment were stained immunocytochemically to obtain the percentage of nuclei containing ER and PR, and a Ki67 labelling index (LI). Tamoxifen-treated patients had a median Ki67 LI of 5.6% in the first biopsy falling to 3.0% in the second biopsy (P < 0.001 by Wilcoxon's matched pairs test), whereas placebo-treated patients had a median Ki67 LI of 5.4% in the first biopsy and 5.75% in the second (no significant difference). No significant differences were observed when the median %ER or %PR staining before and after treatment were compared. The Ki67 LI tended to increase with increasing histological grade and was greater in tumours that were ER - ve compared to those that were ER + ve (> 5% nuclei stained), median 7.8% and 4.3% respectively (P = 0.011 by Mann-Whitney U-test). However, the decline in tumour Ki67 LI following anti-oestrogen treatment failed to correlate with ER and PR status or to predict recurrence over a short follow-up period. To our knowledge, this is the first time that tamoxifen treatment has been shown to reduce the Ki67 LI in human breast tumours in vivo. These data indicate that staining with the Ki67 antibody may be useful in monitoring response to anti-oestrogen therapy.

7881965|a|The influence of primary systemic therapy in treating operable breast cancer on postmastectomy morbidity rates was investigated. The contribution of other risk factors was assessed by multiple logistic regression. Seventy-nine eligible patients were randomly allocated, 39 to undergo immediate modified radical mastectomy, and 40 to receive initial cytotoxic or endocrine treatment followed by mastectomy. Postoperative wound seroma, infection and necrosis were recorded prospectively. Fourteen minor and six major complications occurred in 17 patients treated conventionally, while 14 patients developed 11 minor and six major complications after systemic therapy (P > 0.4). Median hospital stay was 8 days for both groups. Age, smoking, immediate breast reconstruction and the type of primary systemic treatment given were not independent predictors of complication risk. Obesity emerged as a significant risk factor for postmastectomy complications (P = 0.015). Primary systemic therapy does not increase the rate of morbidity after mastectomy.

The conventional sequence of mastectomy followed by systemic therapy is reversed, allowing accurate measurements of response to individual forms of endocrine therapy or chemotherapy. Such a method not only permits individual selection of appropriate systemic therapy, but also allows clinical response to be related to histological and biochemical tumour parameters. A response was observed in eleven of twenty-three patients to endocrine treatment and in twelve of thirteen to combination chemotherapy. In five of the latter the response was histologically complete.

7577066|a|125 stage III breast cancer patients, including 51 cases of inflammatory carcinoma, were treated with the following combined modality approach: three courses of primary 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (FAC) chemotherapy followed by locoregional treatment and subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of three courses of FAC alternating with three courses of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (CMF). Clinical response to primary FAC was 65% (complete 10%). Residual tumour mass in the mastectomy specimen was > 1 and < or = 1 cm in 82 and 18% of cases, respectively. Complete pathological response following primary chemotherapy was achieved in only 3.5% of cases. After primary FAC and local treatment, 97% of patients were disease-free. Overall survival (S) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 5 years were 56 and 34%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that age, receptor status and clinical and pathological response to primary chemotherapy did not appear to influence treatment outcome significantly, whereas stage, presence of inflammatory disease and number of involved nodes had a significant impact on both S and PFS.

6744203|a|One hundred twenty pathologically confirmed operable Stage III (T3N0-2) breast cancer patients were randomized to receive either postoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of these, with or without levamisole immunotherapy. Radiotherapy was given to regional lymph node areas and chest wall. Chemotherapy consisted of 6 cycles of Adriamycin (doxorubicin) (45 mg/m2), vincristine (1.2 mg/m2) intravenously, and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m2 for 5 days) perorally every 4 weeks. Peroral levamisole, 150 mg a day, 2 days weekly, was given as an immunotherapy. The 3-year results are described in this article. The effect of levamisole on the prognosis cannot be evaluated yet because of the short follow-up period. The disease-free survival was almost equal in each patient group, however, some benefit was achieved by levamisole (a shift of disease-free survival from 12 to 18 months). The patients receiving radiotherapy alone had the poorest prognosis: 68% had a recurrent tumor, and 57% were alive. In the chemotherapy group, the figures were 53% and 72%, respectively. Patients who received a combined treatment had the best prognosis: 13% had a recurrent tumor, and 90% survived 3 years. There was a statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between any single therapy and the combined treatment (radiotherapy to combined treatment, P less than 0.001, chemotherapy to combined treatment, P less than or equal to 0.01 chi-square test). In overall survival, a statistically significant difference was reached between radiotherapy and combination treatment groups (P less than 0.01, chi-square test). Radiotherapy gave a good local control of the tumor, and chemotherapy decreased the number of metastases. The nonmetastatic axillary lymph node status and secondary amenorrhea or severe menstrual disturbances were of positive prognostic value. The side effects due to radiotherapy and chemotherapy were moderate and tolerable. The dose of Adriamycin had to be reduced only in four patients. All of the patients receiving chemotherapy had a transient total alopecia. Three of them had nonlethal arrhythmias, and one had skin rash. Levamisole was found very toxic with 9 cases of transient agranulocytosis, leading to the discontinuation of immunotherapy in 22 of 59 patients. Our results show that radiotherapy controls the tumor only locally and chemotherapy systematically, but the best patient-saving results are achieved with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The disease-free and overall survival are statistically significant, and favor the combined therapy.

2372489|a|The effect of systemic therapy on tumour oestrogen receptor (ER) concentration has been studied in 88 patients with large, operable, primary tumours (total 89) of the breast. In 26 patients, tumour was not available for study on one occasion (usually post-treatment). Forty-five patients were treated initially by endocrine therapy but, of these, 13 who had failed to respond went on to receive chemotherapy also. Seventeen patients with low concentrations of ER (less than 20 fmol mg-1 protein) were treated directly by chemotherapy. Patients underwent an incisional biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis and determination of pre-treatment ER by radioligand binding assay, followed by systemic therapy for 3 months (or 6 months for both endocrine and cytotoxic therapies). Response was assessed clinically and mammographically before mastectomy. ER concentration was then determined in the post-treatment tumour specimen. No significant change in ER concentration was seen in any treatment group except when the patients had received tamoxifen; there, receptor concentration fell to very low levels, presumably due to interference with the assay. There was no relationship between tumour response to systemic treatment and change in ER concentration. It is concluded that changes in ER concentration are unlikely to play a major role in the early response of breast tumours to systemic therapy.

2015478|a|One hundred and thirteen women aged 70 years or more with locoregional breast cancer were treated with tamoxifen alone as primary treatment. They were followed for a minimum of 5 years. Complete response occurred in 38 women, partial response in 17, no change in 34 and progressive disease in 24. Where progressive disease occurred, or where patients relapsed after an initial response, the most suitable conventional therapy was given. The actuarial 5-year survival rate was 49.4 per cent for all patients and was much higher (92 per cent) in those showing an initial complete response. Seventy patients (61.9 per cent) were not controlled by tamoxifen alone to death or most recent follow-up. Tamoxifen provides an alternative treatment for operable breast cancer in older women in the short term and may be particularly suitable for those with concurrent disease or who are unwilling to undergo surgery. The low morbidity rate from tamoxifen must be balanced against the need to maintain close follow-up. In the medium to long term, sole primary treatment by tamoxifen delays more definitive therapy.

2112976|a|Two hundred fifty evaluable patients with breast cancer entered a protocol combining neoadjuvant and consolidation therapy by vinblastine (V), thiotepa (T), methotrexate (M), and 5-fluorouracil (F) (VTMF), with or without Adriamycin (A) (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and radiation therapy as exclusive locoregional treatment. Tamoxifen was given to 195 patients (130 postmenopausal and 65 premenopausal) and was omitted in 55 patients (31 postmenopausal and 24 premenopausal). There were 19 Stage I, 86 Stage IIA, 51 Stage IIB, 36 Stage IIIA, and 58 Stage IIIB patients. Primary chemotherapy induced tumor volume regression of more than 75% in 41% of the patients and complete clinical regression in 30% of the patients. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 100% for Stage I, 82% for Stage IIA, 61% for Stage IIB, 46% for Stage IIIA, and 52% for Stage IIIB patients. Among the 72 primary relapses there were 39 distant metastases. The actuarial rate of locoregional recurrence was 13% for T2, 18% for T3, and 19% for T4. At 5 years the rate of breast preservation was 94%. Cosmetic results were excellent or good for most patients. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 95% for Stage I, 94% for Stage IIA, 80% for Stage IIB, 60% for Stage IIIA, and 58% for Stage IIIB. Most patients with breast cancer should be given the option of breast-preserving treatment.

1954179|a|272 women with operable breast adenocarcinomas larger than 3 cm were included in a randomized trial. The patients in group A (n = 138) with histological nodal involvement (N+) or a lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors (EPR-) were treated by initial mastectomy and axillary node dissection + adjuvant chemotherapy. Those in group B (n = 134) were treated by initial chemotherapy (the same as in group A) followed by loco-regional treatment, adjusted according to their response to chemotherapy. Prognostic factors were identical in the two groups. In group A, 32 patients received no adjuvant treatment (N- and EPR+), while 104 were given adjuvant chemotherapy (N+ and/or EPR-). Two patients were lost to follow-up. In group B, all patients received initial chemotherapy; 44 were in complete clinical remission and were treated with radiotherapy only; 40 with residual tumor (less than 20 mm) were treated with tumorectomy + axillary node dissection + radiotherapy; 49 with residual tumors (greater than 20 mm) had mastectomies. Conservative treatment was administered to 84 patients in group B (62.6%). EPR-tumors responded better to chemotherapy than did EPR+ ones (p = .003). After a median follow-up of 34 months, isolated local recurrences were more frequent in the group with initial chemotherapy, which, however, experienced a better overall survival (p = 0.04).

2690913|a|The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of a regimen of combination chemotherapy known to be active in advanced breast cancer when given as an adjuvant treatment after mastectomy. A total of 569 patients with cancer of the breast and involvement of axillary lymph nodes were randomised, after simple mastectomy with axillary sampling, to receive either no adjuvant treatment or intravenous adriamycin 50 mg, vincristine 1 mg, cyclophosphamide 250 mg, methotrexate 150 mg and fluorouracil 250 mg (AVCMF) every 21 days for eight cycles. Randomisation was stratified according to menopausal status and tumour size. Treatment was started within 14 days of surgery in 94% of patients. Eighty-eight per cent of patients received at least seven cycles of chemotherapy with no dose reduction. The median relapse-free survival was prolonged by 14 months in patients treated with AVCMF (chi2 1 = 11.7; P = 0.0006). In the premenopausal group this period was 17 months (chi2 1 = 8.8; P = 0.003) compared with 8 months in the post-menopausal group (chi2 1 = 3.3; P = 0.07). Neither overall survival nor survival in these subgroups was significantly influenced by treatment.

8664127|a|The prognostic value of oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) was estimated through a multicentric study of 2257 operable breast cancer patients followed up for a median of 8.5 years. None of the patients had received adjuvant therapy. The series included 33.3% stage I patients, 57.1% stage II, 5.7% stage IIIa and 2.4% stage IIIb. At the end point of the study 589 metastases and 537 deaths from cancer were recorded. Receptor measurements were performed by radiolgand assay according to a uniform protocol. A total of 68.8% of the tumous were ER positive and 54.0% PR positive ( > or = 10 fmol mg-1 cytosol protein). In univariate analysis, ER and PR status (positive/negative) were of prognostic value (P < 0.001) for the disease-free interval (DFI), the metastases-free interval (MFI) and the overall survival (OS). The OS of the patients after a first metastasis was also significantly different between ER-positive and -negative tumours (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazard model, 1665 patients), only the ER status showed a significant difference (P < 0.01) between positive and negative groups regarding the DFI, MFI and OS. By using Cox non-proportional, time-dependent models, we show that the predictive value of ER status of the primary tumour decreases by approximately 20% per year, losing its significance after 8 years of follow-up. Overall, when compared with TNM and histological grading, ER and PR status have a low prognostic value, their major interest remaining solely in the domain of therapeutic decision.

8279757|a|Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for large operable breast cancers is being increasingly used for the purpose of "downstaging," so that the lesions become accessible to conservative treatment. Since tumor proliferative activity has been shown to be a major prognostic factor for breast cancers, we have studied the value of S-phase fractions established by flow cytometry on cytological samples at diagnosis, in 184 stage II or IIIa patients entered in a randomized trial comparing neoadjuvant to adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients were pre- or perimenopausal, and the median follow-up was for 43 months (24-64). Using the median value (5%) as cutoff, a high SPF was found to be associated with relapse (p < 0.0008), locoregional recurrence (p < 0.02), or metastasis (p < 0.003). However, when the patients were analyzed according to the type of treatment, significance was maintained for the patients in the primary radiotherapy arm (p < 0.003) but not for those in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm (p < 0.06). The overall rate of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly lower for tumors with low SPF (56.5%), compared to tumors with high SPF (85.6%). Thus, SPF was no longer predictive of outcome when the tumors regressed by more than 50% after chemotherapy (p = 0.66), whereas it was highly predictive in the nonresponding patients (p < 0.0001). Our study has revealed that patients with low-SPF tumors, irrespective of response or treatment schedule, had similar prognosis (around 70% free of disease at 45 months), while the high-SPF nonresponders had a dismal prognosis, with less than 25% free of disease at 24 months. If our results are confirmed with a longer follow-up, proliferative activity of breast cancers should prove to be instrumental for the initial therapeutic decision of stage II or IIIa patients.

8080680|a|The aim of this study was to assess a potential advantage in survival by neoadjuvant as compared to adjuvant chemotherapy. 414 premenopausal patients with T2-T3 N0-N1 M0 breast cancer were randomised to receive either four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil), followed by local-regional treatment (group I) or four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy after primary irradiation +/- surgery (group II). Surgery was limited to those patients with a persisting mass after irradiation, and aimed to be as conservative as possible. 390 patients were evaluable. With a median follow-up of 54 months, we observed a statistically significant difference (P = 0.039) in survival in favour of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group. A similar trend was seen when the time to metastatic recurrence was evaluated (P = 0.09). At this stage, no difference in disease-free interval or local recurrence between these two groups could be observed. The mean total dose of chemotherapy administered was similar in both groups. On average, group I had more intensive chemotherapy regimes (doxorubicin P = 0.02) but fewer treatment courses (P = 0.008) as compared to the treated patients in group II. Haematological tolerance was reduced when chemotherapy succeeded to exclusive irradiation. Breast conservation was identical for both groups at the end of primary treatment (82 and 77% for groups I and II, respectively). Of the 191 evaluable patients in the neoadjuvant treatment arm, 65% had an objective response (> 50% regression) following four cycles of chemotherapy. The objective response rate to primary irradiation (55 Gy) was 85%. Improved survival figures in the neoadjuvant treatment arm could be the result of the early initiation of chemotherapy, but we cannot exclude that this difference might be attributable to a slightly more aggressive treatment. So far, the trend in favour of decreased metastases was not statistically significant. The local control appeared similar in both subgroups.

8562150|a|The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate correlations between clinical response to chemotherapy and outcome in a subgroup analysis of premenopausal patients with tumours considered too large for breast conserving surgery, treated with primary chemotherapy (n = 200) from a previously published trial (Scholl S.M., Fourquet A., Asselain B, et al. Eur J Cancer 1994, 30A, 645-652). Objective response rates amounted to 65% following four courses. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, comparing seven parameters, the following variables were associated with poor survival: clinically involved nodes [N1b:RR: 2.7 (95% CI 1.3-5.3)], the failure to respond to chemotherapy [D:RR: 2.62 (95% CI 1.3-5)] and a raised S phase fraction [SPF > 5%: RR: 2.4 (95% CI 1.2-5)]. Parameters associated with increased metastatic recurrence rates, by order of entry in the model, were: young age [< 35: RR: 2.46 (95% CI 1.2-5)], large clinical tumour size [T3: RR: 2.02 (95% CI 1.2-3.4)], poor histological grade (SBR III: RR: 1.93 (95% CI 1.1-3.3)] and the failure to respond to chemotherapy [D: RR: 1.91 (95% CI 1-3.4)]. The assessment of both tumour cell proliferation rates as well as possibly drug resistance markers (although not available in the present study) should be helpful in selecting patients likely to benefit from intensified chemotherapy regimens. The most accurate predictor of response in the present study appeared to be the response to chemotherapy treatment itself.

7993833|a|A phase III randomized trial was activated to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy as compared to preoperative radiation therapy alone, in patients with breast cancer presenting with a clinical stage of IIb-IIIa (TNM classification).From 1985 to 1990, 271 patients, aged 27-55 years, with stage IIb-IIIa breast cancer were randomized to receive either one or two courses of thiotepa 20 mg (i.m. injection) on the days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (total dose per course 120 mg), methotrexate 40 mg/m2, i.v. on days 1 and 8, and 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, i.v. on days 1 and 8 (TMF regimen) plus radiotherapy (Group I, 137 patients), or preoperative radiation therapy only (Group II, 134 patients). After the preoperative treatment all patients underwent mastectomy and complete axillary clearance, and then received 4-6 courses of TMF. The trial was conducted in a single institution (N.N. Petrov Research Institute of Oncology, St. Petersburg).Histopathological assessment of the mastectomy specimens showed complete regression of the tumour in 29.1% of the patients in group I and in 19.4% of the patients e.c. in group II. The estimated 5-year overall survival percentages were 86.1% for group I, and 78.3% for group II (P > 0.05). 5-year disease-free survival percentages were 81.0% and 71.6%, respectively (p < 0.05).Despite the low number of the patients included in the trial, we were able to detect a significant improvement in treatment results with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy given prior to mastectomy over those of local therapy alone with radiation therapy followed by mastectomy, for average- and high-risk patients with operable breast cancer.

427797|a|Six hundred nineteen patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated with a combination of 5-fluorouracil, Adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide, or close variations of this program, with or without immunotherapy were analyzed retrospectively to identify those host, tumor, or treatment characteristics that might be of prognostic importance in predicting response to chemotherapy and survival from onset of the 5-fluorouracil-Adriamycin-cyclophosphamide treatments. Primary tumor characteristics such as size of primary, number of axillary nodes involved, stage at diagnosis, and type of surgery used for primary treatment were not found to be of prognostic significance. Host characteristics such as age, menstrual status, or family history of breast cancer were similarly unrelated to outcome. Non-Caucasian patients had a lower response rate and somewhat shorter survival than did Caucasians. Pretreatment weight loss, poor performance status, and abnormal biochemical and hematological values were of adverse prognostic significance. An estimate of total extent of disease based on criteria for rating extent of involvement at 12 potential sites was a much more important prognostic factor related to response and survival than actual sites of involvement or the traditional "dominant site" classification. There was a trend, however, for patients with bone involvement to have a longer survival than did patients with metastases to other organ sites. Shorter survival times were observed among patients exposed to extensive prior radiotherapy and those who failed to respond to prior hormonal treatment. The prognostic variables identified in this paper should be used for the design and comparison of clinical trials in the future.

1453199|a|A randomized trial was performed in premenopausal postoperative women with ipsilateral axillary node-positive (N+) breast carcinoma and known estrogen receptor (ER) status to assess the efficacy of an Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH)-based induction regimen and 5 or more years of tamoxifen (Tam).Patients received 12 28-day cycles of cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 14, methotrexate 40 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) days 1 and 8, fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 8, prednisone 40 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 14, and Tam 10 mg orally twice daily (CMFPT), or the same regimen plus halotestin 10 mg orally twice daily (CMFPTH) alternating monthly with 22-day cycles of vinblastine 4.5 mg/m2 IV day 1, Adriamycin 45 mg/m2 IV day 1, thiotepa 12 mg/m2 IV day 1, halotestin, and Tam (ALTER). Prednisone in the ALTER regimen was stopped after the second CMFPTH cycle. After 12 cycles, patients were again randomized to stop or continue Tam. After 5 years, patients on Tam were again randomized to continue or stop Tam; the results from this randomization are still coded. Among 533 analyzed induction cases, 263 received CMFPT and 270 ALTER. Among 396 analyzed maintenance cases, 201 continued Tam and 195 were observed. Pretreatment characteristics were balanced among treatments. The median follow-up times are 5.1 years for induction and 4.1 years for maintenance.The time to relapse (TTR) was superior for the ALTER regimen (P = .04) and for the maintenance Tam (P = .05). Overall survival comparisons between the regimens are not statistically different. A longer TTR was associated with decreasing nodal involvement, ER+ status, and increasing age. The favorable effects of decreasing nodal involvement and ER+ status carried over to survival; a progesterone receptor-positive (PgR+) status and decreasing tumor size were also associated with longer survival. Development of amenorrhea was associated with improved TTR and survival. Toxicity was similar for the two induction regimens and for the two maintenance regimens. Overall relapse patterns were similar among the induction regimens, but continuing Tam led to fewer locoregional relapses.The results suggest significant overall TTR therapeutic benefits of an Adriamycin-containing alternating induction regimen and of continuing maintenance Tam therapy for at least 5 years.

2911306|a|We studied the acquisition and transmission of Clostridium difficile infection prospectively on a general medical ward by serially culturing rectal-swab specimens from 428 patients admitted over an 11-month period. Immunoblot typing was used to differentiate individual strains of C. difficile. Seven percent of the patients (29) had positive cultures at admission. Eighty-three (21 percent) of the 399 patients with negative cultures acquired C. difficile during their hospitalizations. Of these patients, 52 (63 percent) remained asymptomatic and 31 (37 percent) had diarrhea; none had colitis. Patient-to-patient transmission of C. difficile was evidenced by time-space clustering of incident cases with identical immunoblot types and by significantly more frequent and earlier acquisition of C. difficile among patients exposed to roommates with positive cultures. Of the hospital personnel caring for patients with positive cultures, 59 percent (20) had positive cultures for C. difficile from their hands. The hospital rooms occupied by symptomatic patients (49 percent) as well as those occupied by asymptomatic patients (29 percent) were frequently contaminated. Eighty-two percent of the infected cohort still had positive cultures at hospital discharge, and such patients were significantly more likely to be discharged to a long-term care facility. We conclude that nosocomial C. difficile infection, which was associated with diarrhea in about one third of cases, is frequently transmitted among hospitalized patients and that the organism is often present on the hands of hospital personnel caring for such patients. Effective preventive measures are needed to reduce nosocomial acquisition of C. difficile.

3144429|a|Clostridium difficile is the etiologic agent of pseudomembranous colitis, a severe, sometimes fatal disease that occurs in adults undergoing antimicrobial therapy. The disease, ironically, has been most effectively treated with antibiotics, although some of the newer methods of treatment such as the replacement of the bowel flora may prove more beneficial for patients who continue to relapse with pseudomembranous colitis. The organism produces two potent exotoxins designated toxin A and toxin B. Toxin A is an enterotoxin believed to be responsible for the diarrhea and mucosal tissue damage which occur during the disease. Toxin B is an extremely potent cytotoxin, but its role in the disease has not been as well studied. There appears to be a cascade of events which result in the expression of the activity of these toxins, and these events, ranging from the recognition of a trisaccharide receptor by toxin A to the synergistic action of the toxins and their possible dissemination in the body, are discussed in this review. The advantages and disadvantages of the various assays, including tissue culture assay, enzyme immunoassay, and latex agglutination, currently used in the clinical diagnosis of the disease also are discussed.

Both toxins elicited erythematous and hemorrhagic skin reactions and increased vascular permeability in rabbit skin.

7738167|a|Toxin A but not toxin B, appears to mediate intestinal damage in animal models of Clostridium difficile enteritis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the electrophysiologic and morphologic effects of purified C. difficile toxins A and B on human colonic mucosa in Ussing chambers. Luminal exposure of tissues to 16-65 nM of toxin A and 0.2-29 nM of toxin B for 5 h caused dose-dependent epithelial damage. Potential difference, short-circuit current and resistance decreased by 76, 58, and 46%, respectively, with 32 nM of toxin A and by 76, 55, and 47%, respectively, with 3 nM of toxin B, when compared with baseline (P < 0.05). 3 nM of toxin A did not cause electrophysiologic changes. Permeability to [3H]mannitol increased 16-fold after exposure to 32 nM of toxin A and to 3 nM of toxin B when compared with controls (P < 0.05). Light and scanning electron microscopy after exposure to either toxin revealed patchy damage and exfoliation of superficial epithelial cells, while crypt epithelium remained intact. Fluorescent microscopy of phalloidin-stained sections showed that both toxins caused disruption and condensation of cellular F-actin. Our results demonstrate that the human colon is approximately 10 times more sensitive to the damaging effects of toxin B than toxin A, suggesting that toxin B may be more important than toxin A in the pathogenesis of C. difficile colitis in man.

3596162|a|The pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile enterocolitis appears to involve colonization of the bowel followed by release of toxin A, an enterotoxin, and toxin B, a cytotoxin. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of purified toxins A and B on intestinal secretion, epithelial permeability, and morphology in perfused rabbit ileal loops. Intestinal permeability after toxin exposure was assessed by blood-to-lumen clearance of [3H]mannitol. Toxin A at doses of 5-100 micrograms/10 cm ileal loop caused a threefold to fivefold increase in [3H]mannitol permeability (p less than 0.001) vs. equal concentrations of toxin B or buffer control. In addition, perfusate from toxin A-exposed loops contained significantly more neutrophils (p less than 0.001) than toxin B or control loops. Toxin A caused severe epithelial cell necrosis with destruction of villi and polymorphonuclear infiltration. Electron microscopy of mucosa subjected to a low dose of toxin revealed widespread nonspecific dilatation of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial swelling. In contrast to these effects of toxin A in ileal loops, in vitro experiments with ileal explants in short-term organ culture revealed that toxin A had no effect on epithelial cell permeability, protein synthesis, release of alkaline phosphatase, or morphology. Our results show that purified toxin A but not toxin B causes severe inflammatory enteritis in rabbit ileal loops, but has no discernable effect on rabbit ileum in vitro. We speculate that toxin A may contribute significantly to intestinal damage in C. difficile-associated colitis and diarrhea.

2105276|a|The gene encoding the toxin A protein of Clostridium difficile (strain VPI 10463) was cloned and sequenced. The coding region of 8,133 base pairs had a mol% G + C of 26.9 and encodes 2,710 amino acids. The deduced polypeptide has a molecular mass of ca. 308 kilodaltons. Nearly a third of the gene, at the 3' end, consists of 38 repeating sequences. The repeating units were grouped into two classes, I and II, on the basis of length and the low levels of DNA sequence similarities between them. There were seven class I repeating units, each containing 90 nucleotides, and 31 class II units, which, with two exceptions, were either 60 or 63 nucleotides in length. On the basis of DNA sequence similarities, the class II repeating units were further segregated into subclasses: 7 class IIA, 13 class IIB, 5 class IIC, and 6 class IID. The dipeptide tyrosine-phenylalanine was found in all 38 repeating units, and other amino acid sequences were unique to a specific class or subclass. This region of the protein has epitopes for the monoclonal antibody PCG-4 and includes the binding region for the Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc carbohydrate receptor. Located 1,350 base pairs upstream from the toxin A translation start site is the 3' end of the toxin B gene. Between the two toxin genes is a small open reading frame, which encodes a deduced polypeptide of ca. 16 or 19 kilodaltons. The role of this open reading frame is unknown.

7907603|a|Neutrophil infiltration is a prominent feature of Clostridium difficile-associated enteritis and colitis. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated tissue damage in C. difficile toxin A-induced enteritis. Competitive binding experiments using purified 3H-toxin A demonstrated the presence of a single class of medium affinity receptors on rabbit neutrophils (Kd 7 x 10(-8) M). Pertussis toxin and the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPgamma S both inhibited 3H-toxin A binding (by 56 and 65%, respectively), indicating that the rabbit neutrophil toxin A receptor is G protein linked. Toxin A elicited a dose-dependent (25-200 micrograms/ml) stimulation of neutrophil migration in vitro, and this functional effect was also pertussis toxin sensitive (69% inhibition). Treatment of neutrophils with R15.7, a blocking monoclonal antibody to the leuocyte adhesion molecule CD18, inhibited toxin A-stimulated neutrophil migration by 85% in vitro. Pretreatment of rabbits with R15.7 also prevented neutrophil infiltration of toxin A-exposed ileal loops in vivo as determined by histologic examination and by ileal tissue myeloperoxidase levels. Furthermore, R15.7 effected a substantial inhibition of fluid secretion (by 65%), mannitol permeability (by 66%), and histologic damage in toxin A-exposed ileal loops. Anti-CD18 (R15.7) had no inhibitory effect on cholera toxin enterotoxicity. These data demonstrate that C. difficile toxin A is a proinflammatory toxin whose enterotoxic effects are substantially dependent upon neutrophil recruitment.

2551764|a|The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of Clostridium difficile toxin A and cholera toxin on fluid secretion, intestinal permeability, and arachidonate metabolites in rabbit ileum. Injection of 25 micrograms of either purified toxin into 10-cm ileal loops caused significant increases in fluid secretion and intestinal permeability to mannitol as well as release of prostaglandin E2 into the lumen. Toxin A, but not cholera toxin, caused a severe inflammatory reaction of the lamina propria and necrosis of enterocytes as well as increased release of leukotriene B4. The toxin A-mediated increases in prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 could be blocked by prior instillation of 10 mg of 5-aminosalicylic acid into ileal loops. 5-Aminosalicylic acid also significantly diminished the expected increase in mannitol permeability after both toxins, but had no significant inhibitory effect on fluid secretion or, in the case of toxin A, intestinal inflammation. Our results indicate that C. difficile and cholera enterotoxins differ substantially in their effects on the rabbit intestine. Clostridium difficile toxin A, an inflammatory toxin, produces a striking infiltration of the lamina propria with neutrophils that is associated with increased release of leukotriene B4. In contrast, cholera toxin does not cause inflammation or leukotriene B4 release. Increased release of prostaglandin E2 occurs after exposure to both toxins and appears to be correlated with increased intestinal permeability.

Recombinant clones containing toxB fragments of the 5' and 3' end were isolate. A 2.5-kb HincII fragment of chromosomal DNA overlaps both groups of clones. A partial restriction map of the total toxB gene is presented. The gene is positioned upstream of utxA and toxA, toxB has a size of 6.9 kb, corresponding to a 250-kDa polypeptide. A partial sequence of the 5' end of toxB was determined. The sequence contains 398 bp upstream of toxB with a putative Shine-Dalgarno box (AGGAGA) and 609 bp of the toxB open reading frame. The N-terminal 203 amino acids of ToxB were compared with the N-terminal amino acids of the enterotoxin A (ToxA). A homology of 64% of the residues was detected, which proves the relatedness of ToxA and ToxB of C. difficile.

7777059|a|Toxin A and B, the major virulence factors of Clostridium difficile, are the causative agents of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. In cultured cell lines their potent cytotoxicity results from their ability to induce disaggregation of the microfilament cytoskeleton. Toxin B acts on the low-molecular-mass GTPase RhoA, which is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. We report here that toxin B catalyses the incorporation of up to one mole of glucose per mole of RhoA at the amino acid threonine at position 37. The modification was identified and localized by tandem electrospray mass spectrometry. UDP-glucose selectively serves as cosubstrate for the monoglucosylation reaction catalysed by toxin B. Microinjection of RhoA previously glucosylated by toxin B into monolayer cells caused disaggregation of actin filaments, indicating a dominant-negative activity of glucosylated RhoA.

7775453|a|The enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile (ToxA) is one of the causative agents of the antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. In cultured monolayer cells ToxA exhibits cytotoxic activity to induce disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton, which is accompanied by morphological changes. ToxA-induced depolymerization of actin filaments is correlated with a decrease in the ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins (Just, I., Selzer, J., von Eichel-Streiber, C., and Aktories, K. (1995) J. Clin. Invest. 95, 1026-1031). Here we report on the identification of the ToxA-induced modification of Rho. Applying electrospray mass spectrometry, the mass of the modification was determined as 162 Da, which is consistent with the incorporation of a hexose into Rho. From several hexoses tested UDP-glucose selectively served as cosubstrate for ToxA-catalyzed modification. The acceptor amino acid of glucosylation was identified from a Lys-C-generated peptide by tandem mass spectrometry as Thr-37. Mutation of Thr-37 to Ala completely abolished glucosylation. The members of the Rho family (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs) were substrates for ToxA, whereas H-Ras, Rab5, and Arf1 were not glucosylated. ToxA-catalyzed glucosylation of lysates from ToxA-pretreated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells resulted in a decreased incorporation of [14C]glucose, indicating previous glucosylation in the intact cell. Glucosylation of the Rho subtype proteins appears to be the molecular mechanism by which C. difficile ToxA mediates its cytotoxic effects on cells.

8944364|a|Clostridium difficile produces two toxins (A and B) which cause antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. One of the most puzzling aspects of C. difficile infection is the wide spectrum of clinical presentation which ranges from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant, life-threatening colitis. This review examines the hypothesis that immune responses to C. difficile underlie these dramatic variations in disease presentation and course. Animals can be protected from C. difficile colitis by passive or active immunization against toxins A and B. Human antibody responses to these toxins are evident in approximately 60% of the general population. A number of clinical studies indicate that antitoxin responses in both serum and intestinal secretions may be protective whereas an inadequate immune response predisposes to severe or recurrent C. difficile diarrhoea. Thus there is now considerable interest in developing methods for passive and active immunization to combat this prevalent nosocomial intestinal pathogen.

1309359|a|Clostridium difficile toxin A, a 308-kilodalton protein exotoxin, is the principal causative agent of antibiotic-associated, C. difficile-induced colitis. In the current study, the prevalence of specific human serum and secretory antibody to toxin A and the possible protective effect of secretory, intestinal anti-toxin A antibody are examined. Serum (n = 35), colonic aspirates (n = 35), and duodenal aspirates (n = 20) were collected from adults at diagnostic endoscopy. Patients with evidence of colitis or a history of recent antibiotic use were excluded from the study. Specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG antitoxin A antibodies were detected in 60% and 57% of subjects, respectively, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fifty-seven percent of colonic aspirates contained IgA antitoxin, whereas only 10% of duodenal aspirates were positive (P = 0.002). Binding of toxin A to its intestinal receptor was studied using [3H]toxin A and purified rabbit ileal brush border membranes. Toxin A binding was significantly inhibited by colonic aspirates with high IgA anti-toxin A antibody levels (0.503 +/- 0.055 pmol toxin A bound per milligram of brush border membrane protein, mean +/- SE) in comparison with antitoxin A-negative aspirates (0.778 +/- 0.089 pmol; P = 0.02) and control (0.766 +/- 0.004 pmol; P = 0.03). In the current study, a specific intestinal secretory IgA antibody response to C. difficile toxin A in humans is reported. This antibody response is more evident in the colon, the site of C. difficile infection, than in the upper intestinal tract. Our data suggest that human colonic IgA antitoxin may protect against C. difficile colitis by inhibiting the binding of toxin A to its intestinal epithelial cell receptor.

7253967|a|Attempts were made to isolate Clostridium difficile from a total of 431 fecal specimens from 149 young and 213 elderly healthy adults, and 69 elderly adults with cerebrovascular disease but no gastrointestinal disease. C difficile was isolated from 49 specimens, and the frequency of isolation was 15.4% in healthy young adults, 7.0% in healthy elderly adults, and 15.9% in elderly adults with cerebrovascular disease. Thirty-four (about 70%) of the 49 C. difficile strains isolated produced cytotoxin which was neutralized by Clostridium sordellii antitoxin in vitro; in both young and elderly adults approximately 30% of the C. difficile isolates were nontoxigenic. The mean concentration of C. difficile in feces was 10(4.1)/g in young adults and 10(4.6)/g in elderly adults, with a range of 10(2.0) to 10(6.9)/g. Antibody against C. difficile toxin was found in most of the sera obtained from young adults carrying toxigenic C. difficile, but not in sera of elderly adults, no matter how abundant was toxigenic C. difficile in the feces.

6886489|a|An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies to toxins A and B of Clostridium difficile was developed. Serum samples from 340 patients were tested for determination of the age-related prevalence of antitoxin. Antibody to toxin A was present in 64% of patients more than two years old and antibody to toxin B in 66% of patients more than six months old. A strongly positive ELISA value correlated with the presence of cytotoxicity-neutralizing antibody (P less than 0.001). Strongly positive ELISA values were obtained more commonly in convalescent sera from 16 patients with C difficile-induced colitis than in sera from the control population (antibody to toxin A, P less than 0.05; antibody to toxin B, P less than 0.001). Testing of paired sera revealed significant increases in the titer of IgG antibody to toxin A or B. Ten of the 16 patients with colitis had IgM titers of greater than or equal to 1:160 to one or both toxins. The data presented suggest that antibodies to toxins A and B are present in the majority of older children and adults and that patients with C difficile-induced disease develop serologic responses to one or both toxins.

4030111|a|Consecutive serum samples from 61 patients with Clostridium difficile diarrhoea were investigated for antibody response to C. difficile toxins A and B in an indirect enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and in a neutralization assay against C. difficile cytotoxin. Sera from 64 blood donors, elderly healthy females and patients with other known intestinal enteropathogens served as controls. An immune response was detected by ELISA in approximately half of the patients with C. difficile diarrhoea. The specificity of the ELISA was 94% or 97%, depending on the control material used. Furthermore, a correlation was found between clinical recovery without relapse of C. difficile diarrhoea and high IgG titers to toxin B in the ELISA, and/or appearance of neutralizing antibodies. It is concluded that the ELISA for detection of serum antibodies to C. difficile toxins may be of diagnostic value in combination with the conventional tissue culture assay for cytotoxin in stool. High ELISA IgG titres to toxin B and/or the appearance of neutralizing antibodies may also be a positive prognostic sign in patients with C. difficile diarrhoea.

1901084|a|We tested the hypothesis that children with chronic relapsing colitis induced by Clostridium difficile toxin have defective antibody responses to C. difficile toxins as a cause of their underlying illness. Six such children were tested for serum IgG and IgA antibody to C. difficile toxin A. These six children had lower IgG anti-toxin A levels than 24 healthy children (p = 0.026) and 18 healthy adults (p = 0.0008). Five patients treated with 400 mg intravenously administered gamma-globulin per kilogram every 3 weeks had significant increases in IgG (p = 0.01) but not IgA anti-toxin A (p = 0.406) levels, and all five had clinical resolution of their gastrointestinal symptoms as well as clearing of C. difficile cytotoxin B from their stools. These observations suggest that a deficiency of IgG anti-toxin A may predispose children to the development of chronic relapsing C. difficile-induced colitis. In such cases, intravenous gamma-globulin therapy may be effective in producing clinical remission.

Although the patient populations were small, the levels of immunoglobulins reactive with C. difficile antigens differed significantly. This difference might reflect the ability of the host to mount an immune response and might be a factor influencing whether a patient develops disease due to this organism. The ability to detect differences in immunoglobulin levels might also help differentiate infection from colonization.

8300199|a|This study investigated whether differences in fecal and serum antitoxin A antibody levels may account for the duration of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and the occurrence of relapses. By an enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay, we tested 40 patients with CDAD including 25 patients without immunodeficiency and 15 patients receiving antineoplastic drugs. Two hundred eighty serum samples and 80 normal stool samples were investigated as controls. In nonimmunocompromised patients, serum immunoglobulin (IgG) and fecal IgA antitoxin A antibody titers were significantly higher in patients who suffered a single episode (n = 21) than in those with relapsing CDAD (n = 4) whose titers were at control levels. Of these 25 patients, eight suffered from diarrhea which lasted for more than 2 weeks. These patients had significantly lower serum- and feces-specific antibody levels than the others who presented symptoms of shorter duration. In cytostatic-treated patients, antitoxin A antibody levels were similar to controls, but relapses occurred in a single case. These data suggest an association between a defective humoral response to toxin A and a more severe form of C. difficile infection. They also indicate that other host-related factors control the severity of CDAD and remain to be elucidated.

8834883|a|Clostridium difficile diarrhea and colitis result from the actions of bacterial exotoxins on the colonic mucosa. This study examined the ability of hyperimmune bovine colostral antibodies to neutralize the biological effects of these toxins. Anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin concentrate was prepared from the colostral milk of Holstein cows previously immunized with C. difficile toxoids. The anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin concentrate contained high levels of bovine immunoglobulin G specific for C. difficile toxins A and B, as evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin concentrate neutralized the cytotoxic effects of purified toxin A and toxin B on cultured human fibroblasts, whereas control bovine immunoglobulin concentrate had little toxin-neutralizing activity. Anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin concentrate also blocked the binding of toxin A to its enterocyte receptor and inhibited the enterotoxic effects of C. difficile toxins on the rat ileum, as measured by an increased rat ileal loop weight/length ratio (63% inhibition; P < 0.01), increased mannitol permeability (92% inhibition; P < 0.01), and histologic grading of enteritis (P < 0.01 versus nonimmune bovine immunoglobulin concentrate). Thus, anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin concentrate neutralizes the cytotoxic effects of C. difficile toxins in vitro and inhibits their enterotoxic effects in vivo. This agent may be clinically useful in the prevention and treatment of C. difficile diarrhea and colitis.

3944088|a|Toxin B, a potent cytotoxin produced by Clostridium difficile, was purified to homogeneity from 6-day broth cultures of a toxigenic isolate. Cytotoxin was purified approximately 4000-fold by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography on a Mono Q anion-exchange column. The molecular weight of reduced purified toxin was 50,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, compared to 150,000 for unreduced toxin. Dose-response studies indicated that subpicogram concentrations of purified toxin caused rounding of approximately 20,000 IMR-90 fibroblasts. The phenomenon of cell rounding caused by toxin B was correlated with the ratio of globular to filamentous actin in fibroblasts as measured by two techniques. The toxin caused a significant increase in the ratio of globular to filamentous actin which was nearly completed prior to the onset of rounding. We conclude that cell rounding of fibroblasts exposed to toxin B is related to an increase in the ratio of globular to filamentous actin which is produced by small numbers of toxin molecules/cell.

Only six of the 12 patients had diarrhea. Five were immunosuppressed. Abdominal computed tomographic scans revealed ascites and a massively thickened colonic wall. All four patients treated by subtotal colectomy survived. Four of 10 patients treated only with laparotomy or segmental colectomy died, four responded to medical therapy, and the conditions of two deteriorated but were salvaged by subtotal colectomy. Early diagnosis via endoscopy or computed tomography should obviate the need for exploratory operations. However, progressive toxic effects indicate failure of medical therapy and the need for subtotal colectomy.

8010571|a|Controversy exists as to the appropriate management of fulminant C. difficile-associated pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). We reviewed our most recent 5-year experience with 191 patients with PMC. Nine patients had an initial presentation of a surgical abdomen with clinical signs of peritonitis, elevated white blood cell count, and eight had received antibiotics prior to presentation. Two patients were placed on no cardiopulmonary resuscitation status at admission to the surgical intensive care unit; both died within 24 hours. The remaining seven patients had exploratory laparotomies. The four who had total abdominal colectomies with ileostomies recovered promptly. Two of the other three had no resection because there was edema of the colon, but no other gross pathological changes. The third had only a segmental colon resection. All three deteriorated postoperatively, and two were dead within 48 hours. The remaining patient was returned to the operating room 48 hours after the first procedure, and an abdominal colectomy and ileostomy was performed. She never recovered, however, and died 12 days later. We conclude that although most patients with PMC can be treated effectively medically, total abdominal colectomy with ileostomy is indicated when signs of peritonitis occur, even if the only finding at laparotomy is edema of the colon.

7720439|a|Reports of fatality related to Clostridium difficile colitis and a sharp increase in prevalence of this infection prompted a study of patients who develop a more aggressive form of this disease.Over 38 months, 710 patients at our institution developed C. difficile colitis. Twenty-one (3 percent) of these patients either required intensive care unit admission or died as a result of their infection. A retrospective, case-controlled study was undertaken to compare these patients, who were considered to have severe C. difficile colitis, with the remaining patients with milder disease.Factors that predisposed to the development of severe C. difficile colitis included intercurrent malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, immunosuppressive and antiperistaltic medications, renal failure, and administration of clindamycin (P < 0.05 for all). Patients with severe C. difficile colitis were more likely to have abdominal pain, tenderness and distention, peritonitis, hemoconcentration (> 5 points), hypoalbuminemia (< 3 mg/dl), and elevated or suppressed white blood cell count (> 25,000; < 1,500; P < 0.05 for all). These factors were used to create a scoring system that could distinguish between patients with severe C. difficile colitis and those with mild disease. Thirteen patients in the late stages of terminal illness with metastatic malignancy or age > 90 were considered poor or inappropriate surgical candidates. Only the remaining eight patients could have potentially recovered from operation with hope for long-term survival. Of these, seven were treated without colonic resection, and six of the seven survived, whereas one patient underwent colectomy and did not survive.Patients with severe C. difficile colitis can be readily identified. Often they have coexisting illness that precludes operation. In this series, only 1 of 21 patients with severe C. difficile might have benefited from an aggressive surgical approach.

7555415|a|Toxic megacolon is a rare complication of pseudomembranous enterocolitis. We reviewed our recent experience with this complication.The first five patients of the series were studied retrospectively, and six others were followed prospectively.Between June 1992 and May 1994, 11 patients (8 male, 3 female) developed toxic megacolon secondary to pseudomembranous enterocolitis. Mean age was 60.7 +/- 11.8 (range, 40-79) years. Presenting symptoms and signs included diarrhea, 100 percent; malaise, 91 percent; abdominal pain, 82 percent; abdominal distention, 82 percent; abdominal tenderness, 72 percent; anemia less than 12 gm, 72 percent; albumin less than 3 gm, 64 percent; tachycardia greater than 100, 55 percent; fever greater than 38.5 degrees celsius, 45 percent; shock or hypotension, 45 percent. Predisposing factors included antibiotics, 64 percent; immunosuppressants or chemotherapy, 36 percent; antidiarrheals, 27 percent; and barium enema in one patient. Five patients (45 percent) had more than one predisposing factor. X-rays showed transverse colon dilation and loss of haustrations in eight patients (72 percent), with a mean diameter of 9.9 +/- 3.4 cm. Flexible proctosigmoidoscopy showed pseudomembranes in all scoped patients, and toxin assay for Clostridium difficile was positive in all patients. One patient had emergency surgery. Ten patients were initially treated medically with nasogastric suction and intravenous resuscitation (90 percent) and antibiotics (100 percent), usually in the intensive care unit (80 percent). Four patients did not respond and underwent surgery; two others improved, then deteriorated, and also underwent surgery. Altogether, 7 of 11 patients (64 percent) underwent surgery. Three patients (27 percent) responded well to medical treatment. One patient was deemed too ill to undergo surgery and died. Mean delay to surgery was 3.0 +/- 1.3 days. No sealed or overt perforation was found at laparotomy. All patients who underwent surgery had a subtotal colectomy, with either a Hartmann's stump (71 percent) or a mucous fistula (29 percent). Eventually, five of seven patients who were operated on and two of four medically treated patients died (overall mortality, 64 percent). Only one patient underwent closure of ileostomy and anastomosis.Toxic megacolon complicating pseudomembranous enterocolitis is a serious problem that carries a high morbidity and mortality rate, regardless of treatment.

2873315|a|An apparent outbreak of Clostridium difficile diarrhoea on the chronic hospital ward of a long-term care facility prompted an investigation lasting seven months. Approximately a third of patients had stools that were positive for C difficile by either toxin or culture. Attempts to eradicate the infection by simultaneously treating all toxin-positive patients with metronidazole, limiting antibiotic use, and implementing enteric isolation were unsuccessful. New cases were both nosocomially acquired and imported into the facility. Of the C difficile toxin-positive patients, 34% had diarrhoea and 19/49 (38%) died during the study period. C difficile is not routinely sought by most clinical microbiology laboratories and may therefore be endemic in many long-term care facilities for the elderly.

8585641|a|Nosocomial diarrhea is a common problem in hospitals, but the epidemiology, causes, and consequences of infectious and iatrogenic nosocomial diarrhea are rarely documented in follow-up or surveillance studies of nosocomial infections. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea in a cohort study of hospitalized patients.The setting was a general medicine ward with a total of 30 beds in private or semiprivate rooms in a county hospital. A prospective cohort study of all consenting patients in the study ward was performed during an 11-month period. Patients were interviewed and cultures were obtained to check for stool pathogens within 48 hours of admission, and patients were followed up during their stay in the study ward. Data from medical notes, laboratory tests, antibiotic logs, and patient interviews were collected daily.Among the 382 eligible patients, nosocomial diarrhea developed in 126 (32.9%): 37 cases were of infectious origin, 57 were iatrogenic, and 32 were of unknown origin. The most common causes of nosocomial diarrhea were Clostridium difficile and antibiotic therapy. Multivariate analysis revealed four risk factors for infectious nosocomial diarrhea: age, length of stay, number of antibiotics, and nasogastric tube feedings. Multivariate analysis also revealed four risk factors for iatrogenic nosocomial diarrhea: number of antibiotics, current gastrointestinal conditions, current renal conditions, and recent surgery. Comorbidity associated with nosocomial diarrhea included increased risk of acquiring another type of nosocomial infection, increased risk of death, and increased length of stay.Nosocomial diarrhea was found to be common and associated with an additional burden of comorbidity. Analyses indicated different risk factors, depending on the etiology of nosocomial diarrhea (infectious or iatrogenic). Further studies are recommended to document the epidemiology and cost analysis of nosocomial diarrhea in other hospital populations.

8185294|a|The immune system changes dramatically with age. There is a decline in the production of naive lymphocytes by the central lymphoid organs, the thymus and bone marrow. This leads to a reduced diversity and altered repertoire of antigen specificities recognized by the immune system. Thus, with age there is a progressive decline in the capacity of the immune system to react with foreign antigens associated with an increased reactivity with autoantigens. As T cells specific for certain microbial antigens decline with age, their capacity to prevent reactivation of certain chronic infections such as herpes zoster diminishes. This results in the increased reactivation of herpes zoster in persons over 45 years old.

1900059|a|The pathogenicity of Clostridium difficile is due to the production of two toxins (toxins A and B). We prepared monoclonal antibodies against toxin A and determined whether axenic mice passively immunized with the monoclonal antibodies were protected against C. difficile disease. The mice were kept in an isolator and were given ascites fluid intravenously prior to challenge with a toxinogenic strain of C. difficile. Control mice and mice receiving ascites fluid devoid of toxin antibody died within 2 days and had high levels of toxins A and B in their feces. Mice that received ascites fluid containing high amounts of toxin A monoclonal antibodies directed against the repeating units of the toxin survived. In protected mice, toxin B levels were similar to those in dying mice, but toxin A levels were greatly reduced. These data show that passive immunity induced by monoclonal antibodies against toxin A was effective against pseudomembranous cecitis.

3679541|a|In this investigation, the role of antibodies against Clostridium difficile toxins A and B in protecting hamsters against C. difficile-associated ileocecitis was examined. We also studied the transfer of protection against C. difficile-associated intestinal disease from immunized female hamsters to their infants. Adult female hamsters immunized parenterally with toxoid A or a mixture containing both toxoids A and B were protected against clindamycin-induced C. difficile-associated fatal ileocecitis. On the other hand, hamsters immunized with toxoid B or a broth filtrate from a nontoxigenic strain of C. difficile were not protected against C. difficile-induced ileocecitis. Antibody against the immunizing toxoid could be demonstrated in both the serum and the cecal contents of hamsters. Some infant hamsters from mothers immunized with toxoid A or AB were protected against C. difficile-associated ileocecitis, while infant hamsters from mothers immunized with toxoid B or a nontoxigenic broth filtrate were not protected against disease. Neutralizing antibodies to toxins A and B could be demonstrated in both maternal milk and serum, as well as in infant serum and intestinal contents. Foster-mothering experiments demonstrated that maternal protection of infants against C. difficile-associated ileocecitis was transferred to infant hamsters through breast milk. These results suggest that toxin A may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of C. difficile-associated ileocecitis in hamsters than toxin B. Furthermore, variations in the severity of C. difficile-associated illness in infants and adults may reflect the lack or presence of passively or actively acquired immunity against C. difficile toxins.

Sequential analysis of serum levels of IgG demonstrated three patient populations in 14 subjects receiving 150 mg/kg. The largest group, nine patients, had progressive reduction of serum IgG values compatible with the half-life of the reagent, with a return to the original serum IgG level in four weeks. A second population of four patients had a slower reduction of serum IgG over the four-week period. IgG values were significantly elevated over baseline values at the time of the next due infusion.

1905325|a|The purpose of this study was to characterize the surface receptor for toxin A, the enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile, on rabbit intestinal brush borders (BB) and on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Purified toxin A was radiolabeled using a modified Bolton-Hunter method to sp act 2 microCi/micrograms, with retention of full biologic activity. 3H-Toxin A bound specifically to a single class of receptors on rabbit BB and on RBL cells with dissociation constants of 5.4 x 10(-8) and 3.5 x 10(-8) M, respectively. RBL cells were highly sensitive to toxin A (cell rounding) and had 180,000 specific binding sites per cell, whereas IMR-90 fibroblasts were far less sensitive to toxin A and lacked detectable specific binding sites. Exposure of BB to trypsin or chymotrypsin significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Preincubation of BB with Bandeirea simplicifolia (BS-1) lectin also reduced specific binding, and CHAPS-solubilized receptors could be immobilized with WGA-agarose. The addition of 100 nM toxin A accelerated the association of 35S-GTP gamma S with rabbit ileal BB, and preincubation of BB with the GTP analogues GTP gamma S or Gpp(NH)p, significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Our data indicate that the membrane receptor for toxin A is a galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine-containing glycoprotein which appears to be coupled to a G protein.

6818150|a|Peritoneal exudate T lymphocytes from Listeria monocytogenes-immune mice in the presence of the homologous antigen (heat-killed L. monocytogenes) and normal macrophages showed L. monocytogenes-specific proliferative responses. Proliferation was inhibited by macrophages from L. monocytogenes- or Corynebacterium parvum-pretreated mice as well as by exogenous prostaglandin E(2). Macrophage-dependent inhibition of T-cell proliferation-at least in part-could be reversed by addition of indomethacin. When selected L. monocytogenes-immune Lyt T-cell subsets were cultured in the presence of inhibitory macrophages, pretreatment with anti-Lyt 1 antiserum plus complement completely abrogated proliferation and pretreatment with anti-Lyt 2 and anti-Lyt 3 antisera plus complement markedly reduced proliferation. However, a mixture (1:1) of the two preselected Lyt T-cell subsets resulted in complete reconstitution of proliferative responses. In contrast, when L. monocytogenes-immune peritoneal exudate T lymphocytes were treated with anti-Lyt antisera plus complement after culture, only treatment with anti-Lyt 1 antiserum plus complement affected proliferation, suggesting regulatory interactions between Lyt 1(+)23(-) and Lyt 1(-)23(+) T cells during in vitro culture which result in proliferation within the Lyt 1(+)23(-) T-cell subset. After rigorous depletion of residual macrophages and in the presence of indomethacin, pretreatment with anti-Lyt 1 antiserum plus complement, but not with anti-Lyt 2 and 3 antisera plus complement, eliminated proliferation. The data presented indicate that interactions between macrophages and Lyt T-cell subsets regulate L. monocytogenes-specific T-cell activation.

6425503|a|The protective mechanisms against Listeria monocytogenes were analysed in mice. Listeria immune mice were rechallenged with viable listeria, and the degree of activation of macrophages, the degree of accumulation of macrophages to the infected sites, and these mechanisms were studied. Enhanced acquired resistance to the reinfection became detectable from the early stage of immunization. It was observed that activation of macrophages was mediated by pretreatment with antigen from the early stage of immunization. Enhanced accumulation of macrophages at the infected sites was observed only in the early stage. Enhanced accumulation and activation of macrophages in the early stage were generated by mediators from listeria antigen sensitized T lymphocytes which were different from classical tuberculin type. Enhanced activation of macrophages in the later stage was generated by MAF and/or MIF from sensitized T lymphocytes of classical tuberculin type. It was suggested that acquired cellular resistance to listeria in the early stage depends on both activation and accumulation of macrophages, and that in the later stage depends on activation of macrophages.

14467923|a|The mouse was found to be natively susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes. Its susceptibility was attributed to the capacity of the organism to survive and multiplying in host macrophages. During the first 3 days of a primary infection the bacterial populations of spleen and liver were found to increase at a constant rate. On the 4th day of infection the host became hypersensitive to Listeria antigens and at the same time bacterial growth ceased. A rapid inactivation of the organism ensued. Convalescent mice were resistant to challenge, but no protective factor could be found in their serum. Histological evidence suggested that acquired resistance was the result of a change occurring in the host's mononuclear phagocytes. When challenged in vitro, the macrophages of convalescent mice were found to resist infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria-resistant cells appeared during the course of infection at a time which corresponded with the development of the antibacterial mechanism in the spleen. They persisted for as long as the antibacterial mechanism remained intact in this organ. This period of absolute resistance to Listeria lasted about 3 weeks. Thereafter, the host remained hypersensitive but unable to inactivate a challenge inoculum of Listeria. However, it remained capable of producing an accelerated response to reinfection. This was thought to depend upon an ability to generate a new population of resistant cells from a residuum of specifically sensitized macrophages or macrophage precursors still surviving in the tissues as a result of the immunological activation which occurred during the primary infection.

1825103|a|CD4-8- TCR-alpha beta+ thymocytes represent a distinct population whose fate and function have remained a mystery. We show here that this thymocyte subset bears NK1, a surface Ag previously thought to be expressed exclusively by TCR- NK cells. Analysis of peripheral lymphocytes for the coexpression of TCR-alpha beta and NK1 revealed a subset with similar characteristics to the NK1+ thymocytes: a large fraction that are CD4-8- and a skewed TCR repertoire in which V beta 8 is overrepresented. Thymus transplant experiments into congenically marked athymic (nude) mice revealed that the NK1+TCR alpha beta+ subset was exclusively thymus derived and represented a distinct subset from the thymus-independent NK1+TCR- population. Finally, the NK1+TCR alpha beta+ population preferentially localizes to the bone marrow. These results demonstrate that this T cell subset is exported to the periphery after developing in the thymus. Their unique surface Ag expression and tissue localization suggest an immune function distinct from classical T cells.

1977798|a|The T cell populations present in normal murine bone marrow have not been previously analyzed in detail, mainly because of their relative rarity. In order to permit such analyses, bone marrow T cells were enriched by depleting Mac1-positive cells, which constitute 65 to 90% of bone marrow cells (BMC), and then studied by two-color flow cytometry. Analysis of the remaining cells revealed that the T cell profile of adult murine bone marrow is markedly different from that of other lymphoid organs. A very high proportion of bone marrow CD3+ cells (approximately one-third) are CD4-CD8-. CD3+CD4-CD8- cells are much more concentrated among BMC T cells than among thymocytes or splenic T cells, suggesting that bone marrow may be either a site of extrathymic TCR gene rearrangement, or a major site to which such cells home from the thymus. The expression of NK1.1 was also evaluated on Mac1-depleted BMC populations. Surprisingly, up to 39% of alpha beta TCR+ BMC were found to express NK1.1. Most alpha beta TCR+NK1.1+ BMC also expressed CD4 or CD8. NK1.1+ alpha beta TCR+ cells represented a much greater proportion of BMC T cells than of other lymphoid (splenocyte or thymocyte) T cell populations. Mac1-depleted BMC of nude mice contained very few cells with this phenotype. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NK1.1+ alpha beta TCR+ cells are generated primarily in the thymus of normal animals and migrate preferentially to bone marrow, where they may function as regulatory elements in hematopoiesis.

1493929|a|We previously demonstrated that the liver may be a major site of extrathymic T-cell differentiation in mice. In the present study, the ontogeny and subsequent development of such T cells in the liver and other organs were investigated. This study was possible because these T cells have T-cell receptors (TcR) of intermediate intensity (i.e. intermediate TcR cells) and constitutively express a high level of interleukin-2 receptor beta chain (IL-2R beta). Therefore the two-colour staining for CD3 (or alpha beta TcR) and IL-2R beta identifies even a small proportion of intermediate TcR cells. The total numbers of mononuclear cells obtained from the liver, thymus and spleen varied from foetal to adult life. Especially in the liver, many haematopoietic cells were present in the parenchymal space at the foetal stage. There were no lymphocytes in the sinusoidal lumen at this period. In contrast, lymphocytes appeared in the hepatic sinusoids after birth and increased with ageing. Phenotypic analysis revealed that intermediate TcR cells appeared in the liver and spleen on Day 4 after birth. Bright TcR cells of thymic origin were also present in the peripheral organs on Day 4. Thereafter, intermediate TcR cells increased in the liver, whereas bright TcR cells increased in the periphery as a function of age. Similarly, thymectomized and congenitally athymic mice had mainly intermediate TcR cells in the liver and, to some extent, periphery. It is concluded that intermediate TcR cells, possibly of extrathymic origin, are generated only after birth and expand with ageing.

3114646|a|Recent studies have demonstrated that CD3 is expressed on a subset of thymocytes with a CD4-CD8- (double negative) phenotype. At least some of these cells bear the CD3-associated gamma delta T-cell receptor (TCR gamma delta). Here we describe a second subset of double negative thymocytes which expresses CD3-associated alpha beta receptors (TCR alpha beta). Surprisingly, these cells express predominantly the products of a single V beta gene family (V beta 8). These CD4-CD8-, TCR alpha beta+ cells appear relatively late in ontogeny (between birth and day 5 of life) and thus are unlikely to be the precursors to the TCR alpha beta-bearing cells (CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+) already present at birth. They can be selectively expanded in vitro by stimulation with a monoclonal antibody to V beta 8 (F23.1) in the presence of interleukin I (IL-1). We propose that this cell type is a unique T-cell population distinguishable from typical TCR alpha beta+ T cells by its CD4-CD8- phenotype and a restricted TCR V beta repertoire. Analysis of the unique phenotype of these cells suggests that they may represent the normal counterpart of the defective CD4-CD8- T cells found in the lpr autoimmune mouse.

3496420|a|A minor subset of immature (CD4-,8-) thymocytes that lack expression of the B2A2 antigen was found to express low levels of surface TCR protein as detected by mAbs F23.1 and KJ16 (reacting with protein products of the V beta 8 gene family). Interestingly, F23.1/KJ16 determinants were expressed on a two- to three-fold higher proportion of B2A2- thymocytes than mature lymph node T cells in four independent haplotypes. When expanded in short-term culture with PMA and calcium ionophore, B2A2- thymocytes retained their overexpression of F23.1/KJ16 determinants and showed a fivefold elevated level (relative to lymph node) of V beta 8-specific mRNA. Taken together, these findings suggest that expression of TCR V beta genes, like Ig genes, is developmentally regulated.

8195719|a|Cultivation of CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) mouse thymocytes and splenocytes with recombinant interleukin 2 (IL2) in the absence of other stimulation results in the generation of DN-CD3/TCR+CD16+NK1.1+B220+ large granular lymphocytes (LGL). Purified DN alpha-beta TCR+ thymocytes and splenocytes are CD16+IL2R alpha-IL2R beta+NK1.1+B220-CD5high. These cells are unique in that they express both CD16 and T cell receptor (TCR) which are usually mutually exclusive. In addition, they express the natural killer (NK) marker, NK1.1. Cultivation of these cells with IL2 for several days results in the generation of DN alpha-beta TCR+CD16+NK1.1+B220+CD5- LGL, suggesting that DN alpha-beta TCR+ cells in thymus and spleen are the precursors of the DN LGL reported previously. DN gamma-delta TCR+CD16-NK1.1-B220-CD5high thymocytes and splenocytes also give rise to DN gamma-delta TCR+CD16+NK1.1+B220+CD5- LGL which, as shown previously with DN alpha-beta TCR+ LGL cells, are cytotoxic against NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells. Cytotoxic activity is also induced through either CD16 or the gamma-delta TCR. DN alpha-beta TCR+ and DN gamma-delta TCR+ LGL cells are thus similar in phenotype to TCR- NK cells. DN alpha-beta TCR+ thymocytes express low levels of the gamma subunit of the high affinity immunoglobulin E receptor (Fc epsilon RI gamma) molecule, an essential component of CD16 expression. Fc epsilon RI gamma expression is greatly enhanced after cultivation with IL2, resulting in a higher surface expression of CD16. In contrast to DN alpha-beta TCR+ thymocytes, DN gamma-delta TCR+ thymocytes do not express detectable CD16 or Fc epsilon RI gamma mRNA but expression of both is induced by cultivation with IL2, leading to the expression of CD16 on the surface. Whereas CD16 molecules on both DN alpha-beta TCR+ and DN gamma-delta TCR+ LGL are associated with only Fc epsilon RI gamma homodimers, the TCR on these cells are associated with an Fc epsilon RI gamma homodimer and/or CD3 zeta-Fc epsilon RI gamma heterodimers. These results demonstrate that the Fc epsilon RI gamma subunit is a component of the TCR in a fraction of T lineage cells.

1696293|a|CD4-, CD8- thymocytes were purified from thymi obtained from normal C57BL/6 mice. By flow cytometry analysis, 5 to 10% of these double negative (DN) thymocytes were found to express NK1.1 on their surface. The NK1.1+ DN thymocytes were demonstrated, by two-color fluorescence, to be CD3lo, CD5hi, CD44hi, J11d-, B220-, MEL 14-, IL2R- with 60% expressing TCR-V beta 8 as determined by the mAb F23.1. In contrast, splenic and peripheral blood NK cells were NK1.1+, CD3-, CD5-, TCR-V beta 8- with 40 to 60% being MEL 14+. Unlike peripheral NK cells, fresh DN thymocytes enriched for NK1.1+ cells were unable to kill YAC-1, the classical murine NK cell target. However, these cells were able to mediate anti-CD3 redirected lysis even when they were assayed immediately after purification, i.e., with no culture or stimulation. These data demonstrate that adult murine thymocytes contain NK1.1+ cells which are distinct, both by function and phenotype, from peripheral NK cells. These data also raise the issue of a possible NK/T bipotential progenitor cell.

1425918|a|Using anti-murine interleukin-2 receptor beta chain (IL-2R beta) monoclonal antibody (mAb), we have examined the expression of IL-2R beta on murine thymocyte subpopulations. We found that it was constitutively expressed on 1%-4% of thymocytes in an almost mutually exclusive fashion with IL-2R alpha. The expression of IL-2R beta is developmentally regulated. While it is expressed mainly on T cell receptor gamma delta+ (TcR gamma delta+) cells during fetal age, the major subpopulation expressing IL-2R beta in adult mouse shifts to CD4-CD8-TcR alpha beta+ thymocytes. A considerable portion of CD4-CD8- TcR alpha beta+ cells in other organs, including spleen, bone marrow and liver, was also found to express IL-2R beta. In fetal thymus organ culture, the above thymocyte subset was induced to expand in response to exogeneous IL-2, and the expansion was inhibited by addition of anti-IL-2R beta mAb, suggesting that IL-2R beta is functional in this subpopulation. However, in vivo blockade of the IL-2/IL-2R pathway with the mAb did not exert any effects on the appearance of CD4-CD8- TcR alpha beta+ cells both in the thymus and the periphery. This indicates that the development of CD4-CD8- TcR alpha beta+ cells is not solely controlled by IL-2 but also by other complex elements.

2108043|a|To search for a potential role of T cell antigen receptor (TcR) gamma/delta-bearing cells in host-defense against Listeria monocytogenes, we analyzed the sequential appearance of gamma/delta and alpha/beta T cell in the peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) during an i.p. infection with sublethal dose (2 X 10(3) of viable Listeria organisms in mice. The PEC on day 1 after the infection consisted of 48% macrophages and 50% lymphocytes, most of which were surface IgM+ (B) cells. The number of PEC increased to the maximal level by day 3. The PEC at this stage contained an appreciable number of CD3+ T cells in addition to a large number of macrophages. Of the CD3+ cells, the proportion of CD4- CD8- cells, most of which expressed no TcR alpha/beta, increased to the maximal level on day 3 after the infection. In correlation with an increased number of CD3+ CD4- CD8- TcR alpha/beta- cells, high level of TcR gamma/delta chain gene messages was detected in the nonadherent population of the PEC on this stage. On the other hand, the PEC on day 8 contained an increased number of CD4+ CD8- and CD4- CD8+ cells which expressed TcR alpha/beta chain on their surface. These results suggest that the gamma/delta T cells precede the alpha/beta T cells in appearance during listerial infection. The gamma/delta T cells may be involved at the first line of the host-defense against Listeria.

1530961|a|We have previously reported that T cells bearing T cell receptors (TCRs) of gamma/delta type appear at a relatively early stage of primary infection with Listeria monocytogenes in mice. To characterize the early-appearing gamma/delta T cells during listeriosis, we analyzed the specificity and cytokine production of the gamma/delta T cells in the peritoneal cavity in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with a sublethal dose of L. monocytogenes. The early-appearing gamma/delta T cells, most of which were of CD4-CD8- phenotype, proliferated and secreted IFN-gamma and macrophage chemotactic factor in response to purified protein derivative from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or recombinant 65-kD heat-shock protein derived from M. bovis but not to heat-killed Listeria. To further elucidate the potential role of the gamma/delta T cells in the host-defense mechanism against primary infection with Listeria, we examined the effects of in vivo administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against TCR-gamma/delta or TCR-alpha/beta on the bacterial eradication in mice infected with Listeria. Most of alpha/beta T cells or gamma/delta T cells were depleted in the peripheral lymphoid organs at least for 12 d after an intraperitoneal injection of 200 micrograms TCR-alpha/beta mAb or 200 micrograms TCR-gamma/delta mAb, respectively. An exaggerated bacterial multiplication was evident at the early stage of listerial infection in the gamma/delta T cells-depleted mice, whereas the alpha/beta T cell-depleted mice exhibited much the same resistance level as the control mice at this stage although the resistance was severely impaired at the late stage after listerial infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

7621874|a|We found that the number of T cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells increased in the peritoneal cavity on day 5 after an intraperitoneal infection with Listeria monocytogenes strain EGD together with TCR gamma delta + CD4- CD8- T cells. Thereafter, the TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells decreased to a normal level by day 14. The TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells showed an activated T cell phenotype (L-selectin CD44 +) and expressed CD45/B220 and interleukin-2 receptor beta, but did not express heat stable antigen, which is expressed by the immature CD4- CD8- thymocytes. Furthermore, 20-30% of the TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells expressed the NK1.1 natural killer cell marker. Analysis of the TCR V region repertoire of the TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells induced by L. monocytogenes infection showed that more than 80% of the TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells expressed TCR V beta 8 detected by anti-TCR V beta 8.1 and 8.2 mAb, and a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of V alpha 14 relative to V alpha 11 expression revealed that the TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells expressed a higher level of V alpha 14, which was reported to be preferentially expressed by TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- thymocytes rather than conventional CD4+ T cells. The TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8-T cells showed a proliferative response to anti-TCR alpha beta mAb stimulation. In contrast, they showed no response to stimulation with either Listeria antigen or 65-kDa heat shock protein of Mycobacterium bovis, which do stimulate the Listeria-specific TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells and the Listeria-induced TCR gamma delta + T cells, respectively. These results suggest that the TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells may recognize a restricted set of self antigens induced by L. monocytogenes infection, and that they contribute to host protection at an early stage of infection.

1579166|a|The protein Lck (p56lck) has a relative molecular mass of 56,000 and belongs to the Src family of tyrosine kinases. It is expressed exclusively in lymphoid cells, predominantly in thymocytes and peripheral T cells. Lck associates specifically with the cytoplasmic domains of both CD4 and CD8 T-cell surface glycoproteins and interacts with the beta-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor, which implicates Lck activity in signal transduction during thymocyte ontogeny and activation of mature T cells. Here we generate an lck null mutation by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to evaluate the role of p56lck in T-cell development and activation. Lck-deficient mice show a pronounced thymic atrophy, with a dramatic reduction in the double-positive (CD4+CD8+) thymocyte population. Mature, single-positive thymocytes are not detectable in these mice and there are only very few peripheral T cells. These results illustrate the crucial role of this T-cell-specific tyrosine kinase in the thymocyte development.

8609419|a|Listeria monocytogenes-specific, IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells are induced in 5-day in vitro cultures of naive spleen cells with viable L. monocytogenes (VLM) but are not induced in cultures with heat killed L. monocytogenes (HKLM). Anti-IL-12 Abs abrogated the induction of the IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells by VLM, suggesting an importance of IL-12 in the induction of IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells. Accordingly, IL-12p40 was expressed by macrophages (M phi) from the cultures of whole spleen cells with VLM but not with HKLM, although HKLM induced IL-12p40 expression on M phi when nonadherent cells were removed before culture. In vivo analysis also showed that VLM induced IL-12p40 expression by M phi, whereas HKLM failed to induce it. On the other hand, the addition of anti-IL-10 mAb into cultures of whole spleen cells and HKLM resulted in an increase of IL-12p40 expression by M phi. Furthermore, we detected an expression of IFN-gamma by both adherent and nonadherent spleen cells at the early stage of stimulation with VLM before the appearance of IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells. These data suggest that HKLM induce nonadherent spleen cells to produce IL-10 which may down-regulate IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells by blocking IL-12 production by M phi. In contrast, VLM support IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T cells by stimulating M phi to produce IL-12 and IFN-gamma.

7816142|a|Exposure to various pathogens can stimulate at least two patterns of cytokine production by CD4-positive T cells. Responses that result in secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), lymphotoxin and interleukin-2 (IL-2) are classified as T-helper-1 (Th1); CD4+ T-cell production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13 is called a T-helper-2 response (Th2). Differentiation of CD4+ T cells into either Th1 or Th2 cells is influenced by the cytokine milieu in which the initial antigen priming occurs. Here we use flow cytometry to identify the presence of intracellular cytokines (cytoflow) and analyse T-cell production of IFN-gamma and IL-4 from mice infected with Listeria monocytogenes or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. We show that T cells bearing gamma delta receptors discriminate early in infection between these two pathogens by producing cytokines associated with the appropriate T-helper response. Our results demonstrate that gamma delta T cells are involved in establishing primary immune responses.

1385604|a|The predominant mechanism responsible for acute specific rejection of allogeneic and parental bone marrow by irradiated mice is due to a cell (TNK) that expresses the NK cell surface markers NK1 and ASGM1 as well as TCR. Here we analyze the question as to whether TNK cells require a functional thymus for their development. Using adoptive cell transfer assays, evidence is presented that, as is the case in normal mice, NK1+ CD3+ effector cells are responsible for rejection in thymus-deficient nude mice and that the specificity of rejection is indistinguishable from that of normal mice. To reveal the presence of TNK cells in the spleen of nude mice, double staining for NK1 and CD3 followed by FACS analysis was done. It is shown that NK1+ CD3+ cells are present in the spleens of nude but not euthymic mice, suggesting that the lack of a functional thymus stimulates either Ag expression or the number of TNK cells. In support of this finding, the treatment of irradiated marrow reconstituted mice with cyclosporin A leads to the appearance of TNK cells in the spleen. The relative efficiency of spleen cells from nude and cyclosporin A-treated mice to transfer resistance in adoptive cell transfers was assessed and found to be higher than that of normal spleen, consistent with the higher frequency of these cells in thymus-defective mice. The fate of NK1+ CD3+ cells subsequent to stimulation with an allogeneic marrow graft indicates that these cells proliferate in nude mice without gaining cytolytic activity. In euthymic mice, however, NK1+ CD3+ cells appear transiently but disappear in favor of CD4+ and CD8+ cells that proliferate in response to an allogeneic marrow graft. The CD8+ cells express cytolytic activity with specificity similar to that of the acute rejection mechanism, consistent with the suggestion that TNK cells differentiate into CD8+ killer cells. The reason why TNK cells in nude mice fail to differentiate into CD8+ CTL is explained by the lack of Th cells.

8386744|a|It is known that rearrangement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) gene occurs in the thymus during T cell development and consequently results both in the deletion of DNA between the variable (V) and diversity/joining segments and in the formation of a circular DNA with recombination signal sequences. Here, we provide evidence that V alpha 14+ TCR gene rearrangements take place in extrathymic sites, such as bone marrow, liver, and intestine, but not in spleen, because we were able to detect frequent productive and nonproductive V alpha 14+ coding and signal sequences as a result of TCR rearrangements in extrathymic sites. Similar findings were also detected in athymic mice. Quantitative analysis shows that the relative amounts of V alpha 14 gene-mediated signal sequences in extrathymic tissues are higher than those in thymus. On the contrary, TCR rearrangements of V alpha 1.1 T cells, which are known to develop in the thymus, were mainly detected in the thymus, Peyer's patch, and spleen, but not in other extrathymic tissues, showing patterns distinct from V alpha 14 TCR rearrangements. These findings are evidence of extrathymic development of V alpha 14+ T cells. Differential characteristic TCR rearrangement patterns also indicate that distinct TCR repertoires are generated in different lymphoid tissues.

8287494|a|Fetal thymus grafting into athymic nude mice has been used as an experimental model of T cell development. To understand the early events of T cell development, we have examined the sequence of appearance of T cell subsets in lymph nodes (LN) of BALB/c nu/nu mice after grafting with syngeneic fetal thymus. T cells expressing T cell receptor (TCR) alpha/beta or gamma/delta increased in LN from 1 week after grafting, although no host-derived CD3+ T cells were detected in the grafted thymus and no donor thymus-derived T cells were detected in the LN. The early appearing T cells of both TCR alpha/beta and TCR gamma/delta showed a CD4-CD8- phenotype. V region usage analysis of the early appearing TCR alpha/beta T cells revealed that they contained cells bearing V beta 3 or V beta 11, which are potentially reactive to self-superantigen Mls-2a or Dvb11, respectively, and are deleted in the course of T cell development in the thymus of euthymic BALB/c mice. The early appearing T cells showed neither mixed lymphocyte reaction nor cytotoxic T cell activity against allogeneic cells. In contrast, lymphokine-activated killer cells from early appearing T cells, which contained high percentages of TCR gamma/delta T cells, exhibited higher cytotoxic activity against P815 mastocytoma than those from euthymic mice or untreated nude mice. All these results suggest that the early appearing T cells are developed extrathymically. We propose that the thymus may induce extrathymic T cell development without direct cell-to-cell interaction. It seems likely that the extrathymically developed T cells, especially TCR gamma/delta T cells, induced by the thymus have some role in the defense mechanism in the absence of conventional thymus-derived T cells.

1831220|a|Autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr (lpr) mice develop severe lymphadenopathy, characterized by the accumulation of alpha beta-T cells with CD4-8- double negative (DN) phenotype, at the onset of disease. We previously demonstrated that the liver is a major site for the proliferation of such DN alpha beta-T cells. Herein, we further demonstrate that a large proportion of alpha beta-T cells in the liver and other organs, except the thymus, of lpr mice have unique properties, such as DN phenotype, relatively dull TCR intensity, a preponderance of V beta 8+ cells, and Pgp-1 expression. Interestingly, alpha beta-T cells in the liver of normal mice were found to consist of T cells with intermediate intensity of TCR (i.e., brighter than thymic dull TCR and lower than thymic bright TCR) as well as with bright intensity of TCR in the immunofluorescence test. These hepatic alpha beta-T cells with intermediate TCR in normal mice were found to have properties similar to those of alpha beta-T cells in lpr mice. These results suggest that abnormal alpha beta-T cells in lpr mice are a counterpart of normal T cells in the liver. An abnormal expansion of such T cells in the liver might be fundamental to the pathogenesis involved in these autoimmune mice.

CD3int LMNC express NK1.1 and show a skewed T cell receptor (TCR) V region repertoire with relatively high levels of V beta 8 and V alpha 14 expression, further suggesting that they belong to a different lineage from conventional T cells, which lack NK1.1 expression and V region skewing. Since the liver has been proposed to be a site of extrathymic T cell differentiation in adult mice, we analyzed LMNC for the presence of T cell precursors. CD3- LMNC contained CD4- CD8- cells and CD4lo CD8- cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed both CD3- populations express the recombination-activating gene -1, which is indispensable in gene rearrangement of TCR and expressed by thymic T cell precursors. Furthermore, when electronically sorted CD3- LMNC were cultured in medium without any feeder cells or exogenously added cytokines for 24 h, CD3int cells, but not CD3hi cells, appeared. These results suggest that the adult liver contains T cell precursors that lack the expression of the CD3/TCR complex, but are strongly committed to differentiate into extrathymic liver CD3int T cells.

2785564|a|We have used the intra-thymic transfer system to investigate the population dynamics of thymocyte and mature T cell subsets in the absence of continuing precursor input from the bone marrow. We have followed the development and life span of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocyte subsets and mature peripheral T cells from intra-thymically injected adult or fetal CD4-8- thymic precursors. Both precursor types proliferated, differentiated, and exported to peripheral lymphoid tissues alpha beta-TCR+CD4+8- and CD4-8+ progeny which formed a stable, long-lived component of the peripheral T cell pool. The production of phenotypically mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells occurred more rapidly from fetal CD4-8- precursors. CD4+8-:CD4-8+ ratios among peripheral progeny of intra-thymically-injected CD4-8- precursors were initially normal, but they steadily declined among progeny of the fetal precursors. Thus, there appear to be differences in the life span and/or proliferative capacity of mature T cells derived from embryonic vs adult progenitors. In addition to the predominant CD4+8- and CD4-8+ subsets of peripheral T cells, a minor (1 to 20%) population of Thy-1+CD3+4-8- T cells was identified among peripheral progeny of intra-thymically-injected CD4-8- thymocytes, as well as in lymph nodes of unmanipulated animals. A total of 20 to 34% of this subset expressed V beta 8+ TCR and the majority were CD5hi, Pgp-1+, and J11d-. The function and specificity of this newly identified population of thymically derived peripheral T cells remains to be investigated.

3262426|a|The CD4 and CD8 T cell antigens are thought to transduce an independent signal during the process of T cell activation. We report our evaluation of the possible involvement of the lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase p56lck in these transduction pathways. Our data demonstrate that p56lck is specifically modulated with either CD4 or CD8 following antibody-mediated cross-linking of these molecules and that a large fraction of the total cellular lck protein can be coimmunoprecipitated with these surface glycoproteins. These results suggest that p56lck is functionally and physically associated with CD4/CD8 in normal murine T lymphocytes and support the concept that an independent signal is transduced by the interaction of these surface molecules with major histocompatibility complex determinants.

2582490|a|The CD4 lymphocyte surface glycoprotein and the lck tyrosine protein kinase p56lck are found as a complex in T lymphocytes. We have defined the domains in both proteins that are responsible for this interaction by coexpressing hybrid and deleted forms of the two proteins in HeLa cells. We have found that the unique 32 amino-terminal residues of p56lck and the 38 carboxy-terminal residues of CD4 that comprise the cytoplasmic domain are both necessary and sufficient by themselves for the interaction of the two proteins. The interaction appears to be independent of other T cell-specific proteins and probably occurs before CD4 reaches the cell surface. Our findings suggest that the specialized amino-terminal domains of other members of the src family of intracellular tyrosine kinases may also mediate transmembrane signaling via coupling to the cytoplasmic domains of specific transmembrane proteins.

1671341|a|The T cell-specific transmembrane glycoprotein CD4 interacts with class II MHC molecules via its external domain and is associated with tyrosine kinase p56lck via a cysteine motif in its cytoplasmic domain. We have assessed the ability of CD4 to synergize with the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) for induction of transmembrane signals that result in lymphokine production. Mutant CD4 molecules were introduced into T cells that lacked endogenous CD4 but expressed TCRs specific for lysozyme peptides or the superantigen SEA bound to Ab or Abm12 class II MHC molecules. With either ligand, T cell activation occurred only when CD4 was associated with p56lck. These results demonstrate that residues within the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 are required for its coreceptor function in TCR-mediated signal transduction and strongly support the notion that the association of CD4 with p56lck is critical in this process.

2047859|a|In the interleukin-2 (IL-2) system, intracellular signal transduction is triggered by the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R beta); however, the responsible signaling mechanism remains unidentified. Evidence for the formation of a stable complex of IL-2R beta and the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase p56lck is presented. Specific association sites were identified in the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain of p56lck and in the cytoplasmic domain of IL-2R beta. As a result of interaction, IL-2R beta became phosphorylated in vitro by p56lck. Treatment of T lymphocytes with IL-2 promotes p56lck kinase activity. These data suggest the participation of p56lck as a critical signaling molecule downstream of IL-2R via a novel interaction.

1334460|a|The variable region genes of the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains are assembled by somatic recombination of separate germline elements. During thymocyte development, gene rearrangements display both an ordered progression, with beta chain formation preceding alpha chain, and allelic exclusion, with each cell containing a single functional beta chain rearrangement. Although considerable evidence supports the view that the individual loci are regulated independently, signaling molecules that may participate in controlling TCR gene recombination remain unidentified. Here we report that the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase p56lck, when overexpressed in developing thymocytes, provokes a reduction in V beta--D beta rearrangement while permitting normal juxtaposition of other TCR gene segments. Our data support a model in which p56lck activity impinges upon a signaling process that ordinarily permits allelic exclusion at the beta-chain locus.

8385609|a|The lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase p56lck participates in T cell signaling through functional interactions with components of the T cell antigen receptor complex and the interleukin-2 receptor. Additional insight into the function of p56lck has now been obtained through the generation of transgenic animals expressing high levels of a catalytically inactive form of this kinase (p56lckR273). Mice bearing the lckR273 transgene manifested a severe defect in the production of virtually all T lymphocytes. Those exceptional CD3+ cells that escaped the effects of the lckR273 transgene were confined primarily to the T cell subset that expresses gamma/delta T cell receptors. Remarkably, construction of a dose-response curve for the effects of the lckR273 transgene revealed that developmental arrest of thymocytes occurred at a discrete stage in the normal T cell maturation pathway, corresponding to a point at which thymoblasts ordinarily begin a series of mitotic divisions that result in expansion and maturation. These results suggest that p56lck normally regulates T cell production by metering the replicative potential of immature thymoblasts.

1386860|a|This study follows our previous investigation describing the production of four cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha) by subsets of thymocytes defined by the expression of CD3, 4, 8, and 25. Here we investigate in greater detail subpopulations of CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) thymocytes. First we divided immature CD25-CD4-CD8-CD3- (CD25- triple negative) (TN) thymocytes into CD44+ and CD44- subsets. The CD44+ population includes very immature precursor T cells and produced high titers of IL-2, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma upon activation with calcium ionophore and phorbol ester. In contrast, the CD44- subset of CD25- TN thymocytes did not produce any of the cytokines studied under similar activation conditions. This observation indicates that the latter subset, which differentiates spontaneously in vitro into CD4+CD8+, already resembles CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (which do not produce any of the tested cytokines). We also subdivided the more mature CD3+ DN thymocytes into TCR-alpha beta- and TCR-gamma delta-bearing subsets. These cells produced cytokines upon activation with solid phase anti-CD3 mAb. gamma delta TCR+ DN thymocytes produced IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, whereas alpha beta TCR+ DN thymocytes produced IL-4, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha but not IL-2. We then studied alpha beta TCR+ DN T cells isolated from the spleen and found a similar cytokine production profile. Furthermore, splenic alpha beta TCR+ DN cells showed a TCR V beta gene expression profile reminiscent of alpha beta TCR+ DN thymocytes (predominant use of V beta 8.2). These observations suggest that at least some alpha beta TCR+ DN splenocytes are derived from alpha beta TCR+ DN thymocytes and also raises the possibility that these cells may play a role in the development of Th2 responses through their production of IL-4.

7790021|a|The cytokine production profile, focusing on interleukin-4 (IL-4), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) of human CD4+, CD8+ and CD4- CD8- alpha beta T cells cloned from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals was compared. Solid-phase anti-CD3 stimulation of CD4- CD8- alpha beta T cell clones from one individual revealed a significantly increased frequency of IL-4-producing clones (81%), compared to CD4+ T cells (24%) or CD8+ (28%). All five CD4- CD8- alpha beta T-cell clones from two other individuals also produced IL-4. Clones that produced IFN-gamma with undetectable IL-4 production, thus being of the 'classical' Th1 phenotype, were infrequent in CD4- CD8- alpha beta T-cell clones (19%) compared to CD4+ (71%), and CD8+ clones (72%) cloned in OKT3, and CD4+ cells cloned in phytohaemaglutinin A (77%). Unlike previously reported studies with gamma delta cells, the alpha beta CD4- CD8- T cells produced IL-10 at appreciable frequency (38%) in PHA generated clones. The supernatants from anti-CD3 stimulated CD4- CD8- alpha beta T-cell clones contained sufficient IL-4 to activate B cells, enhancing CD23 and surface immunoglobulin M (IgM) expression and co-stimulating B-cell proliferation. These findings suggest that the function of CD4- CD8- alpha beta T cells is distinct from that of most CD4+ or CD8+ T cells.

7594451|a|Differentiation of naive CD4+ lymphocytes into either Th1 or Th2 cells is influenced by the cytokine present during initial Ag priming. IL-4 is the critical element in the induction of Th2 response; however, its origin during a primary immune response is not well defined. In the present study, we characterized a novel potential source of IL-4, the class I-selected CD4-CD8-TCR-alpha beta+ T cells. In a first set of experiments, we demonstrated that CD4-CD8-TCR-alpha beta+ thymocytes produce a large amount of IL-4 after in vitro anti-CD3 stimulation. This phenomenon was not observed in class I-deficient mice, demonstrating that among these cells, the class I-selected subset was predominantly responsible for IL-4 production. Further studies focused on the in vivo IL-4-producing capacity of peripheral CD4-CD8-TCR-alpha beta+ T cells. To this end, a single injection of anti-CD3 mAb, which promptly induces IL-4 mRNA expression, was used. Peripheral CD4-CD8-TCR-alpha beta+ T cells express high levels of IL-4 mRNA in response to in vivo anti-CD3 challenge. Furthermore, analysis performed in mice lacking MHC class I or class II molecules demonstrates that both the class I-selected subset of CD4-CD8-TCR+ and CD4+ peripheral T lymphocytes are the major IL-4 producers after in vivo anti-CD3 stimulation. These findings suggest that class I-selected CD4-CD8-TCR-alpha beta+ and CD4+ T cell populations are important sources of IL-4 probably implicated in the development of specific Th2 immune responses.

7527500|a|Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules bind immunogenic peptides and present them to lymphocytes bearing the alpha beta T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). An analogous antigen-presenting function also has been proposed for the non-MHC-encoded CD1 molecules, a family of non-polymorphic, beta 2-microglobulin-associated glycoproteins expressed on most professional antigen-presenting cells. In support of this hypothesis, CD1 molecules are recognized by selected CD4-CD8- alpha beta or gamma delta TCR+ T-cell clones, and we have recently shown that CD1 molecules restrict the recognition of foreign microbial antigens by alpha beta TCR+ T cells. But the substantial structural divergence of CD1 from MHC class I and class II molecules, raises the possibility that the antigens presented by the CD1 system may differ fundamentally from those presented by MHC-encoded molecules. Here we report that a purified CD1b-restricted antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis presented to alpha beta TCR+ T cells is mycolic acid, a family of alpha-branched, beta-hydroxy, long-chain fatty acids found in mycobacteria. This example of non-protein microbial antigen recognition suggests that alpha beta TCR+ T cells recognize a broader range of antigens than previously appreciated and that at least one member of the CD1 family has evolved the ability to present lipid antigens.

7684433|a|We analyzed the T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements of 100 TCR-alpha/beta CD4-CD8- (double negative [DN]) T cell clones from normal individuals. We found that in four out of six donors this subset contains expanded clones that often account for 0.5% and, in one individual, even 7% of all peripheral blood lymphocytes. By combining limiting dilution analysis and N region oligotyping of polymerase chain reaction amplified TCR cDNA, we could measure the clonal size and show that two of these expanded clones remain stable in size for up to 4 yr in peripheral blood. The expanded clones analyzed ex vivo are not cycling and CD45 RAhi ROlo, but express high levels of alpha 4/beta 1 integrins, suggesting that they may have reverted to resting cells after activation. One of these expanded DN clones proliferates in vitro in response to Escherichia coli presented by monocytes cultured in GM-CSF plus IL-4 and kills CD1a+ Molt-4 cells. In contrast to what was found in the alpha/beta DN subset, alpha/beta CD4+ T cell clones specific for a tetanus toxin epitope showed a very small clonal size (< 1 in 10(7)) and could not be reisolated after 2 yr. Taken together, these results indicate that large clonal size and persistence are distinctive features of alpha/beta DN cells specific for bacterial antigens. These cells may use antigen-presenting cells, restriction molecules, and selection routes different from those used by antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.

7542404|a|It has long been the paradigm that T cells recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. However, nonpeptide antigens can be presented to T cells by human CD1b molecules, which are not encoded by the MHC. A major class of microbial antigens associated with pathogenicity are lipoglycans. It is shown here that human CD1b presents the defined mycobacterial lipoglycan lipoarabinomannan (LAM) to alpha beta T cell receptor-bearing lymphocytes. Presentation of these lipoglycan antigens required internalization and endosomal acidification. The T cell recognition required mannosides with alpha(1-->2) linkages and a phosphotidylinositol unit. T cells activated by LAM produced interferon gamma and were cytolytic. Thus, an important class of microbial molecules, the lipoglycans, is a part of the universe of foreign antigens recognized by human T cells.
