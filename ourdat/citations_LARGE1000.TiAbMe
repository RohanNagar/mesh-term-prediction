2844968|a|The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) polypeptide Vmw65 is a structural component of the virus particle and is also responsible for trans-induction of immediate early (IE) transcription. Functional domains of this polypeptide were investigated by constructing a series of 10 plasmids each with a 12 bp insertion in the gene encoding Vmw65. Plasmids were analysed for their ability to stimulate IE transcription in short term transfection assays, and the altered Vmw65 polypeptides were assayed for the ability to form an IE-specific protein-DNA complex (IEC) in vitro. A direct correlation was observed between stimulation of transcription and formation of IEC, strongly suggesting that IEC is an important intermediate in transcription activation. Plasmids were also tested for their ability to rescue the temperature-sensitive mutation in the HSV-2 assembly mutant ts2203, since marker rescue analysis indicated that this mutation maps within the gene encoding Vmw65. Five plasmids failed to rescue ts2203, thereby defining regions of Vmw65 required for virus assembly. The results show that distinct domains exist in Vmw65 for activation of transcription and assembly of virus.

6096556|a|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) immediate early (IE) transcription is known to be stimulated by a structural component of the virion which interacts, either directly or indirectly, with specific regulatory sequences located far upstream from IE messenger RNA 5'-termini. The aim of the work described in this paper is the mapping and identification of the virion component. Cloned HSV DNA fragments derived from various parts of the genome were cotransfected into BHK cells together with chimaeric plasmids which contained the thymidine kinase gene under IE control. Stimulation of thymidine kinase synthesis was elicited by cloned EcoRIi (0.63 to 0.72 map units), BamHIf (0.64 to 0.69) or EcoRIb (0.72 to 0.87). Cloned BamHIf had the same specificity as the virion component, since it stimulated thymidine kinase expression only from chimaeric plasmids which contained functional IE-specific regulatory sequences. The effect of EcoRIb was not confined to plasmids with IE-specific regulatory regions, suggesting a more general stimulatory role for one or more of the polypeptides encoded by this fragment. A subclone containing a 2.7 X 10(3) base-pair fragment of BamHIf (pMC1) was active in the cotransfection assay, and the effect was abolished by an eight base-pair insertion into the middle of this fragment. The only polypeptide known to map entirely within the HSV genome region defined by pMC1 was identified as the major tegument species Vmw65. The results therefore suggest that Vmw65 is the virion component which trans-activates HSV IE transcription.

1327963|a|A virion protein of herpes simplex virus type-1, called Vmw65, alpha TIF or VP16, interacts with cellular transcription factors to transactivate immediate early viral genes. We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the homologous protein in bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). The amino acid sequence of the BHV-1 protein is similar to that of alpha TIF, except in the C-terminal one-third of the protein. Since the ability of alpha TIF to activate transcription is dependent on this region, our results suggest that the BHV-1 homologue either does not act as a transactivator or activates genes by a different mechanism.

9237997|a|The Oct-1 POU domain binds diverse DNA-sequence elements and forms a higher-order regulatory complex with the herpes simplex virus coregulator VP16. The POU domain contains two separate DNA-binding domains joined by a flexible linker. By protein-DNA photocrosslinking we show that the relative positioning of the two POU DNA-binding domains on DNA varies depending on the nature of the DNA target. On a single VP16-responsive element, the POU domain adopts multiple conformations. To determine the structure of the Oct-1 POU domain in a multiprotein complex with VP16, we allowed VP16 to interact with previously crosslinked POU-domain-DNA complexes and found that VP16 can associate with multiple POU-domain conformations. These results reveal the dynamic potential of a DNA-binding domain in directing transcriptional regulatory complex formation.

2676518|a|Activation of herpes simplex virus immediate early gene expression normally requires the formation of a ternary complex between a virus trans-activator, Vmw65, a cellular octamer-binding protein, TRF and the cis-acting target sequence, the TAATGARAT motif. We report that the C-terminal 79 amino acids of Vmw65, which contain a potential acidic amphipathic helix, can activate transcription in both yeast and mammalian cells in the absence of TRF interaction when fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor, GAL4. Together with our previous report which showed that the recruitment of TRF to the DNA by Vmw65 is insufficient for transcription activation, these results indicate that the octamer binding protein may not be directly involved in transcriptional induction mediated by Vmw65. The TRF-Vmw65 complex may therefore represent a novel class of transcription activator in which the protein domain responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding, present in TRF, and that necessary for induction of transcription, within Vmw65, are located on separate proteins. These results are discussed with reference to combinatorial transcriptional control and the role of octamer-binding proteins in other systems.

2999707|a|Previous work has shown that transcriptional activation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) immediate early genes is mediated by a protein species (Vmw65) present in the tegument of infecting virions. This paper describes DNA sequence analysis and mRNA mapping of the Vmw65 gene in HSV-1 strain 17. The Vmw65 coding region was identified as a 490 codon sequence encoding a polypeptide of molecular weight 54,342 and characterised by a high proportion of charged amino acid residues. A homologue to Vmw65 was detected in the genome of varicella-zoster virus, another human herpesvirus. Apart from its role in trans-activation, Vmw65 is a major constituent of the virion. Its possible significance in virus structure is discussed.

3018124|a|The entire DNA sequence of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was determined using the M13-dideoxynucleotide technology. The genome is variable in size, but the sequence which was obtained comprises 124884 bp. Analysis of the sequence indicated that the genome contains 70 genes distributed about equally between the two DNA strands. The genes are organized compactly, but regions of overlap between protein-coding regions are not extensive. Many of the genes are arranged in 3'-coterminal families, and at least one is spliced. The discerned organization of VZV genes and that deduced for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) from published transcript mapping data indicate that these two members of the Alphaherpesvirinae are very similar in gene layout. Comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequences of VZV proteins with those available for HSV-1 proteins generally suggest evolution from an ancestral genome, and allow the functions of several VZV genes to be deduced, although limited regions where the genomes differ in functional organization were also identified.

1309782|a|A glutathione S-transferase fusion to the COOH-terminal acidic transactivation domain of Vmw65 from herpes simplex virus type 1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and isolated by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. Following cleavage of the fusion protein with thrombin, the transactivation domain was purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography yielding approximately 0.6 mg of protein/liter of bacterial culture. Equilibrium sedimentation analysis showed the purified polypeptide to be monomeric; however, it displayed aberrant electrophoretic and chromatographic properties. Contrary to secondary structure predictions, circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that this transactivation domain was devoid of significant alpha-helical structure at physiological conditions. The polypeptide, however, became notably more structured under hydrophobic conditions or at low pH, suggesting that it was sensitive to its environment. Near-UV circular dichroism suggested that phenylalanyl and tyrosyl residues were under influence from tertiary structure.

9389645|a|Upon infection of human cells, the herpes simplex virus protein VP16 associates with the endogenous cell-proliferation factor HCF. VP16 can also associate with HCFs from invertebrates, suggesting that VP16 mimics a cellular protein whose interaction with HCF has been conserved. Here, we show that VP16 mimics the human basic leucine-zipper protein LZIP, which, through association with HCF, may control cell-cycle progression. VP16 and LZIP share a tetrapeptide motif-D/EHXY-used to associate with human HCF. The LZIP-related Drosophila protein BBF-2/dCREB-A contains this HCF-binding motif, indicating that the LZIP-HCF interaction has been conserved during metazoan evolution.

9087427|a|The temperature-sensitive BHK21 hamster cell line tsBN67 ceases to proliferate at the nonpermissive temperature after a lag of one to a few cell divisions, and the arrested cells display a gene expression pattern similar to that of serum-starved cells. The temperature-sensitive phenotype is reversible and results from a single missense mutation--proline to serine at position 134--in HCF, a cellular protein that, together with the viral protein VP16, activates transcription of herpes simplex virus (HSV) immediate-early genes. The tsBN67 HCF mutation also prevents VP16 activation of transcription at the nonpermissive temperature. The finding that the same point mutation in HCF disrupts both VP16 function and the cell cycle suggests that HCF plays a role in cell-cycle progression in addition to VP16-dependent transcription.

2335815|a|Herpes simplex virus type 1 virion protein Vmw65 forms a complex (TRF.C) with TAATGARAT sequences and the cellular transcription factor oct-1, which has been implicated as an intermediate in the activation of gene expression by Vmw65. To examine structural requirements within Vmw65 for this interaction, we analyzed extracts of transfected cells that express mutant Vmw65 proteins by gel retardation assay and identified two regions in the primary sequence of Vmw65 which are necessary for in vitro assembly of TRF.C. The amino-terminal boundary for complex assembly and trans activation mapped between residues 49 and 75. At the carboxyl terminus, deletion as far as residue 388 did not affect in vitro TRF.C assembly, although trans-activating activity was abolished. Deletion beyond residue 388 rapidly impaired the ability of the protein to participate in the TRF.C complex, such that a truncated mutant of 380 residues was completely inactive. These requirements towards the carboxyl terminus overlap a region of strong local sequence similarity between Vmw65 and terminal protein p3 of bacteriophage phi 29. Although substitution of corresponding p3 residues into Vmw65 failed to produce a functional chimera, site-directed mutagenesis within the region of similarity identified a number of single-point mutant proteins which were completely deficient for TRF.C formation. These mutant proteins were also unable to trans activate expression from immediate-early promoters, despite the integrity of the acidic carboxyl terminus. The extreme sensitivity of both TRF.C formation and trans activation to single-residue substitutions within this region of Vmw65 suggests that it is directly involved in the protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions required for assembly of a transcriptional complex containing oct-1.

2156166|a|Induction of transcription of the immediate-early (IE) genes of herpes simplex virus (HSV) involves the assembly of a DNA-binding complex containing the cellular transcription factor Oct-1 and the virus regulatory protein Vmw65 (VP16). Complex assembly can be observed using deletion variants of Vmw65 which lack the acidic C-terminal activation domain and are therefore defective for IE transactivation. Similar variants of Vmw65 interfere with IE activation by the normal protein, and with HSV replication. It has therefore been suggested that dominant interfering products of viruses such as HSV and HIV could be used in a form of intracellular immunization against virus infection. Here we report that a small peptide overlapping a region of Vmw65 which is critical for complex assembly specifically inhibits assembly of the complex but has no observed effect on the DNA-binding activity of the cellular factor alone. Selective interference with the assembly of transcription complexes by short peptides corresponding to functionally critical regions of virus regulatory proteins may be more feasible than the use of defective polypeptides as an antiviral strategy based on competitive interference.

8380468|a|The cellular factor Oct-1 is selectively recruited, together with at least one other cellular protein (CFF), into a multicomponent transcription complex whose assembly is directed by the herpes simplex virus regulatory protein Vmw65 (VP16). The acidic carboxy terminus of Vmw65 is not involved in assembly of the complex but is absolutely required for subsequent transcriptional activation. Elucidation of the mechanism of action of Vmw65 is important for an understanding not only of combinatorial control of gene expression by POU- and homeodomain proteins but also of the interaction(s) between activation domains of regulatory proteins and components of the basal transcriptional apparatus. We used a combination of limited proteolysis with a number of site-specific proteases and immunological detection to demonstrate the presence of two main surface-exposed regions in Vmw65. We mapped these sites to within a few amino acids at positions 365-370 408/409. The site at 408/409 is indicative of a flexible exposed linker region between the acidic carboxy-terminal activation domain (residues 430-480) and an N-terminal domain involved in complex formation with the two cellular factors. The site around residues 365-370 is precisely within a region that results from this and other laboratories have shown to be critical for complex formation. Furthermore, we show that this site is selectively protected from proteolysis after complex assembly. Finally, using a series of overlapping peptide encompassing this region, we show that the eight amino acids, R-E-H-A-Y-S-R-A, from positions 360 through 367 are sufficient to inhibit complex formation by intact Vmw65. We propose that these residues contain sufficient information to selectively bind one of the cellular partners involved in complex assembly and that these residues are located in a physical surface-exposed domain of the protein.

Here, we show that these two Oct-1 coregulators possess similar, if not identical, homeodomain recognition properties but possess different virus-specific cis-regulatory specificities: the HSV-1 VP-16 protein activates transcription from the HSV-1 VP16 response element, and the BHV-1 VP16 protein activates transcription from the BHV-1 VP16 response element. A distinct 3-bp segment, the D segment, lying 3' of the canonical TAATGARAT motif (where R is a purine) in the VP16 response element is responsible for the differential cis element recognition and transcriptional activation by these two homeodomain coregulators. These results demonstrate how a single homeodomain protein can direct differential transcriptional regulation by selective association with homologous homeodomain coregulators.

Both of these complexes contain the ubiquitous Oct-1 protein, whose POU domain alone is sufficient to allow assembly of the alpha TIF-dependent complexes. A second member of the POU domain family, the lymphoid specific Oct-2 protein, can also be assembled into similar complexes at high concentrations of alpha TIF protein.

1980658|a|Trans-activation by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) protein, alpha TIF (VP16), is dependent on an inducible enhancer sequence that contains a homolog of the octamer element. An ordered series of multiprotein complexes can be assembled on this enhancer, requiring the interactions of Oct-1, alpha TIF, and two additional cellular factors (C1 and C2). Oct-1 binds to the octamer homolog, whereas alpha TIF, also a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, recognizes sequences within the HSV enhancer core. The partially purified C1 factor interacts directly with alpha TIF in the absence of DNA and is required to form a stabile Oct-1/alpha TIF/C1 factor complex. The POU domain of Oct-1 is a bipartite sequence recognition structure, as both the POU-specific box and the POU homeo box contribute directly to the recognition of the octamer element. Surprisingly, the POU homeo box alone is sufficient to direct the cooperative binding of alpha TIF and to assemble the Oct-1/alpha TIF/C1 factor complex.

The isolation of cDNAs encoding the polypeptides of the C1 factor suggests that these proteins are proteolytic products of a novel precursor. The sequence of the amino termini of these polypeptide products indicate that the proteins are generated by site-specific cleavages within a reiterated 20-amino acid sequence.

9372942|a|In contrast to our understanding of the roles of Oct-1 and VP16 in VP16-mediated transcriptional activation, virtually nothing is known of the role of the second cellular component, termed host cell factor (HCF), or of its structure-function relationships. We show that the majority of the internal region of HCF, including the repeats involved in HCF cleavage, is dispensable for complex assembly with VP16 and Oct-1. The N-terminal domain of HCF (HCF.N) had only weak VP16 binding and complex promoting activity, while the C-terminal region (HCF.C) had no intrinsic activity. However, the C-terminal region strongly enhanced complex formation and reduced dissociation kinetics when linked to the N-terminal domain (HCF.NC). The potent activity of the HCF.NC fusion in complex assembly was recapitulated in vivo in yeast and mammalian cells. Moreover, HCF.N could promote increased complex formation when the acidic activation domain of VP16 was deleted. Restoration of the activation domain strongly inhibited complex formation with HCF.N, but the addition of the C-terminal domain of HCF restored strong stable complex formation with intact VP16. The results indicate that this C-terminal domain is critically required to alter the presentation of the acidic domain of VP16. Additional results are consistent with the interpretation that this alteration in acidic domain presentation for complex assembly also facilitates the activation function in VP16. The sequence of an HCF homolog from Caenorhabditis elegans shows it to be a natural HCF.NC construct, reinforcing the conclusions from our functional analysis.

9199328|a|Upon infection, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) activator of immediate-early (IE) gene transcription VP16 forms a multiprotein-DNA complex with two cellular proteins, Oct-1 and HCF. First, VP16 associates with HCF independently of DNA, and this association stimulates subsequent association with Oct-1 on the DNA target of VP16 activation, the TAATGARAT motif found in HSV IE promoters. We have analyzed the involvement of VP16 residues lying near the carboxy-terminal transcriptional activation domain of VP16 in associating with HCF, Oct-1, and DNA. To assay VP16 association with HCF, we developed an electrophoretic mobility retardation assay in which HCF is used to retard the mobility of a hybrid VP16-GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion protein bound to a GAL4 DNA-binding site. Analysis of an extensive set of individual and combined alanine substitutions over a 61-amino-acid region of VP16 shows that, even within a region as small as 13 amino acids, there are separate residues involved in association with either HCF, DNA, or Oct-1 bound to DNA; indeed, of two immediately adjacent amino acids in VP16, one is important for DNA binding and the other is important for HCF binding. These results suggest that a small region in VP16 is important for linking in close juxtaposition the four components of the VP16-induced complex and support the hypothesis that the structure of the Oct-1-VP16 interaction in this complex is similar to that formed by the yeast transcriptional regulatory proteins MATa1 and MAT alpha2. We propose that HCF stabilizes this Oct-1-VP16 interaction.

1358756|a|The selective association of the herpesvirus trans-activator VP16 with the human Oct-1 homeo domain is a model for differential positive transcriptional control by homeo domains. VP16 discriminates between the closely related homeo domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 by distinguishing among their seven amino-acid differences; these differences lie on the surface that is thought to be accessible when the homeo domain is bound to DNA. Only two of these seven differences are recognized by VP16, one in each of the first two alpha-helices of the tri-alpha-helical homeo domain. The major determinant for selective association with VP16 in vitro and VP16-induced positive control in vivo is a single glutamic acid residue at position 22 in the first alpha-helix of the Oct-1 homeo domain, but the acidic properties of this residue are not critical for association with VP16 in vitro or in vivo, because it can be replaced by glutamine with little or no deleterious effect. Mere replacement of the single corresponding alanine residue in the Oct-2 homeo domain with the key glutamic acid residue is sufficient to confer on the Oct-2 homeo domain the ability to associate with VP16 in vitro and respond to VP16-induced positive control in vivo. Thus, the specificity of homeo domain positive control can be conferred by a single amino acid difference.

7569974|a|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MATa1 and MAT alpha 2 homeodomain proteins, which play a role in determining yeast cell type, form a heterodimer that binds DNA and represses transcription in a cell type-specific manner. Whereas the alpha 2 and a1 proteins on their own have only modest affinity for DNA, the a1/alpha 2 heterodimer binds DNA with high specificity and affinity. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the a1/alpha 2 homeodomain heterodimer bound to DNA was determined at a resolution of 2.5 A. The a1 and alpha 2 homeodomains bind in a head-to-tail orientation, with heterodimer contacts mediated by a 16-residue tail located carboxyl-terminal to the alpha 2 homeodomain. This tail becomes ordered in the presence of a1, part of it forming a short amphipathic helix that packs against the a1 homeodomain between helices 1 and 2. A pronounced 60 degree bend is induced in the DNA, which makes possible protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts that could not take place in a straight DNA fragment. Complex formation mediated by flexible protein-recognition peptides attached to stably folded DNA binding domains may prove to be a general feature of the architecture of other classes of eukaryotic transcriptional regulators.

9658067|a|In human cells infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV), viral gene expression is initiated by the virion protein VP16. VP16 does not bind DNA directly but forms a multiprotein complex on the viral immediate-early gene promoters with two cellular proteins: the POU domain protein Oct-1 and host cell factor (HCF; also called C1, VCAF, and CFF). Despite its apparent role in stabilizing the VP16-induced transcription complex, the natural biological role of HCF is unclear. Only recently HCF has been implicated in control of the cell cycle. To determine the role of HCF in cells and answer why HSV has evolved an HCF-dependent mechanism for the initiation of the lytic cycle, we identified the first human ligand for HCF (R. Lu et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 17:5117-5126, 1997). This protein, Luman, is a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors that can activate transcription from promoters containing cyclic AMP response elements (CRE). Here we provide evidence that Luman and VP16 share two important structural features: an acidic activation domain and a common mechanism for binding HCF. We found that Luman, its homolog in Drosophila, dCREB-A (also known as BBF-2), and VP16 bind to HCF by a motif, (D/E)HXY(S/A), present in all three proteins. In addition, a mutation (P134S) in HCF that prevents VP16 binding also abolishes its binding to Luman and dCREB-A. We also show that while interaction with HCF is not required for the ability of Luman to activate transcription when tethered to the GAL4 promoter, it appears to be essential for Luman to activate transcription through CRE sites. These data suggest that the HCF-Luman interaction may represent a conserved mechanism for transcriptional regulation in metazoans, and HSV mimics this interaction with HCF to monitor the physiological state of the host cell.

8754841|a|VP16 (termed VP16-H here) of herpes simplex virus (HSV) belongs to a family of related regulatory proteins which includes VP16-B of bovine herpesvirus (BHV). We show that VP16-B, while also being a powerful transactivator of transcription dependent on Oct-1 binding sites in its target promoters, has virtually no activity on a defined VP16-H-responsive, octamer-containing target promoter. While Oct-1 binds equally well to the VP16-B-responsive and -nonresponsive sites, VP16-B interacts with Oct-1 only when Oct-1 is bound to the BHV octamer site and not when it is bound to the HSV site. We show from the analysis of chimeric proteins that the ability of VP16-B to discriminate between the Oct-1 forms depends on features of its N-terminal region. We also show from an analysis of chimeric DNA motifs that sequences that lie 3' to the POU domain-contacting region of the HSV octamer site play a role in making it unresponsive to VP16-B. Finally, we show by high-resolution hydroxyl radical footprint analysis that the conformation of Oct-l is different on the two sites. These results augment our previous report on an allosteric effect of DNA signals on the conformation of bound proteins and indicate that different conformations of the same DNA binding protein can be recognized selectively by related members of interacting regulatory proteins. The possible implications of our observations for selective gene regulation by Oct-1, a ubiquitous transcription factor, and other multimember transcription families are discussed.

1758883|a|We demonstrate in this work that the surface tension, water-organic solvent, transfer-free energies and the thermodynamics of melting of linear alkanes provide fundamental insights into the nonpolar driving forces for protein folding and protein binding reactions. We first develop a model for the curvature dependence of the hydrophobic effect and find that the macroscopic concept of interfacial free energy is applicable at the molecular level. Application of a well-known relationship involving surface tension and adhesion energies reveals that dispersion forces play little or no net role in hydrophobic interactions; rather, the standard model of disruption of water structure (entropically driven at 25 degrees C) is correct. The hydrophobic interaction is found, in agreement with the classical picture, to provide a major driving force for protein folding. Analysis of the melting behavior of hydrocarbons reveals that close packing of the protein interior makes only a small free energy contribution to folding because the enthalpic gain resulting from increased dispersion interactions (relative to the liquid) is countered by the freezing of side chain motion. The identical effect should occur in association reactions, which may provide an enormous simplification in the evaluation of binding energies. Protein binding reactions, even between nearly planar or concave/convex interfaces, are found to have effective hydrophobicities considerably smaller than the prediction based on macroscopic surface tension. This is due to the formation of a concave collar region that usually accompanies complex formation. This effect may preclude the formation of complexes between convex surfaces.

1314658|a|We have overproduced and purified the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain of Vmw65 (VP16) of herpes simplex virus, and studied potential folding of the domain by 1H NMR. Two species of the acidic domain were obtained from the bacterial expression system, and we demonstrate that one of these represents read-through of the natural amber termination codon of the Vmw65 reading frame producing a larger polypeptide. Additional residues in the read-through product were identified by total amino acid analysis and by NMR. Study of the correctly terminated product by 1D NMR gave resonances which were clustered into groups around their random-coil chemical shift positions, and 2D NMR demonstrated that, even in mixed solvents containing up to 80% MeOH, there was very little evidence of secondary structure. Together these results indicate that the isolated acid domain has little if any alpha-helical content of any stable nature. We discuss these results with reference to the demonstrated activity of the acidic domain in a wide variety of polypeptide contexts.

3162770|a|We have developed three computer programs for comparisons of protein and DNA sequences. They can be used to search sequence data bases, evaluate similarity scores, and identify periodic structures based on local sequence similarity. The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.

1358755|a|Homeo domain proteins exhibit distinct biological functions with specificities that cannot be predicted by their sequence specificities for binding DNA. Recognition of the surface of the Oct-1 POU homeo domain provides a general model for the contribution of selective protein-protein interactions to the functional specificity of the homeo domain family of factors. The assembly of Oct-1 into a multiprotein complex on the herpes simplex virus alpha/IE enhancer is specified by the interactions of its homeo domain with ancillary factors. This complex (C1 complex) is composed of the viral alpha TIF protein (VP16), Oct-1, and one additional cellular component, the C1 factor. Variants of the Oct-1 POU homeo domain were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, which altered the residues predicted to form the exposed surface of the domain-DNA complex. Proteins with single amino acid substitutions on the surface of either helix 1 or 2 of the Oct-1 POU homeo domain had decreased abilities to form the C1 complex. The behavior of these mutants in a cooperative DNA-binding assay with alpha TIF suggested that the Oct-1 POU homeo domain is principally recognized by alpha TIF in the C1 complex. The preferential recognition of Oct-1 over the closely related Oct-2 protein is critically influenced by a single residue on the surface of helix 1 because the introduction of this residue into the Oct-2 POU homeo domain significantly enhanced its ability to form a C1 complex.

7499437|a|The herpes simplex virus transactivator VP16 directs the assembly of a multicomponent protein-DNA complex that requires the participation of two cellular factors, the POU homeodomain protein Oct-1, which binds independently to response elements, and VCAF-1 (VP16 complex assembly factor; also called HCF, C1), a factor that binds directly to VP16. A number of distinct properties of VP16 have been implicated in the assembly of the VP16-induced complex (VIC). These include its independent association with VCAF-1 and, under appropriate conditions, its ability to bind to DNA or to DNA-bound Oct-1 in the absence of VCAF-1. In order to probe the requirements of these individual interactions in the functional assembly of VIC, we mutated selected charged amino acids in two subdomains of VP16 previously shown to be important in protein-DNA complex formation. Purified VP16 proteins were analyzed for their ability to direct protein-DNA complex formation and to interact directly with VCAF-1. Several classes of mutants that were differentially compromised in VCAF-1 interaction, direct DNA binding, and/or association with DNA-bound Oct-1 were obtained. Interestingly, all of the derivatives were still capable of generating the VIC complex in vitro and activating transcription in vivo. Our findings indicate that the cooperative assembly of functional VP16-containing complexes can occur by pathways that do not necessarily require the prior interaction of VP16 with VCAF-1 or the ability of VP16 to bind directly to DNA or associate with DNA-bound Oct-1.

8617752|a|The transcriptional activation domain of the herpesvirus protein VP16 resides in the carboxyl-terminal 78 amino acids (residues 413-490). Fluorescence analyses of this domain indicated that critical amino acids are solvent-exposed in highly mobile segments. To examine interactions between VP16 and components of the basal transcriptional machinery, we incorporated (at position 442 or 473 of VP16) tryptophan analogs that can be selectively excited in complexes with other Trp-containing proteins. TATA-box binding protein (TBP) (but not transcription factor B (TFIIB)) caused concentration-dependent changes in the steady-state anisotropy of VP16, from which equilibrium binding constants were calculated. Quenching of the fluorescence from either position (442 or 473) was significantly affected by TBP, whereas TFIIB affected quenching only at position 473. 7-aza-Trp residues at either position showed a emission spectral shift in the presence of TBP (but not TFIIB), indicating a change to a more hydrophobic environment. In anisotropy decay experiments, TBP reduced the segmental motion at either position; in contrast, TFIIB induced a slight change only at position 473. Our results support models of TBP as a target protein for transcriptional activators and suggest that ordered structure in the VP16 activation domain is induced upon interaction with target proteins.

9094665|a|The herpes simplex virus VP16 protein functions as a potent transcriptional activator and targets DNA sites with the consensus TAATGARAT present in all the viral immediate-early gene promoters. To do so, VP16 directs assembly of a multiprotein complex involving two cellular proteins, host cell factor (HCF) and the Oct-1 DNA-binding transcription factor. To investigate the importance of specific protein-protein interactions to formation of this VP16-induced complex (VIC), we used oligopeptides to prevent VIC assembly. Linear and cyclic peptides corresponding to a region of VP16 previously implicated in complex formation were potent inhibitors of VIC assembly. To further characterize the protein interactions involved, we cloned a human cDNA encoding the minimal VP16 interaction domain of HCF, containing amino acids 1 to 380 [HCF (1-380)]. The REHAYS-based peptides active in preventing VIC assembly were found to specifically block binding of VP16 to HCF (1-380), without affecting VP16-Oct-1 binding. The inhibitory activity of these VP16 peptides was strictly sequence specific for the EHAY residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of the HCF (1-380) domain revealed residues E102 and K105 to be critical determinants in support of VIC formation. Alteration of a single residue in HCF, K105, was shown to virtually abolish complex assembly. Interestingly however, none of the HCF mutants that were impaired in their ability to support complex formation exhibited defects in direct VP16 binding, supporting loss of function at a higher order in complex assembly.

8139019|a|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) virions contain at least two regulatory proteins that modulate gene expression in infected cells: the transcriptional activator VP16 and the virion host shutoff protein vhs. VP16 stimulates transcription of the HSV immediate-early genes, and vhs suppresses host protein synthesis and induces accelerated turnover of cellular and viral mRNAs. We report here that vhs binds directly to VP16: vhs and VP16 were coprecipitated from infected cells by an anti-vhs antiserum, and vhs and VP16 protein A fusions each bound intact versions of the other protein in a solid-phase capture assay. In addition, vhs and VP16 interacted in the two-hybrid activator system when coexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. vhs residues 238 to 344 were sufficient for the interaction, and the VP16 acidic transcriptional activation domain was not required. vhs blocked the ability of VP16 to enter a multiprotein complex on an immediate-early TAATGARATTC consensus sequence, indicating that vhs interacts with one or more regions of VP16 required for promoter recognition. We suggest that this interaction may play a structural role in the assembly of HSV virions and modulate the activity of vhs during infection.

This VP16-induced complex alters the regulatory activity of Oct-1, in part, by associating it with the potent VP16 acidic transcriptional activation domain. Here, we show that in the absence of HCF, VP16 can recognize specifically the Oct-1 homeo domain. A region of VP16 near the acidic activation domain appears to be involved exclusively in homeo domain recognition because a 4-amino-acid insertion within this region only affects the ability of VP16 to interact with Oct-1, leaving its DNA- and HCF-binding activities unchanged. A 33-amino-acid peptide containing this region complexes with the Oct-1 POU domain bound to DNA, suggesting that this VP16 region contains an autonomous homeo domain recognition subdomain.

2843425|a|Mature virions of herpes simplex virus type 1 contain an activating factor that primes transcription from the five virally encoded immediate early (IE) genes. This activator is specified by a 65-kD polypeptide termed VP16. The action of VP16 is mediated through cis-regulatory elements located in regions adjacent to each IE gene. Although VP16 is normally introduced into cells by infecting virions, its trans-activating function can also be observed by cotransfecting cells with a plasmid that encodes VP16 along with a reporter gene driven by IE cis-regulatory sequences. We have used such an assay to examine the function of mutant forms of VP16. Our results provide tentative identification of two domains of VP16 that are crucial to its role in the induction of IE gene expression. One domain is located within the carboxy-terminal 78 amino acids of VP16 and is characterized by its acidity. Another domain, located in a more amino-terminal region of the protein, appears to tailor the specificity of VP16 for IE genes. According to the results presented in this and the accompanying paper, we predict that VP16 achieves IE gene specificity via protein: protein, rather than protein: DNA, interaction.

9271577|a|Activation domains are functional modules that enable sequence-specific DNA binding proteins to stimulate transcription. The structural basis for the function of activation domains is poorly understood. A combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and biochemical experiments revealed that the minimal acidic activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein undergoes an induced transition from random coil to alpha helix upon binding to its target protein, hTAFII31 (a human TFIID TATA box-binding protein-associated factor). Identification of the two hydrophobic residues that make nonpolar contacts suggests a general recognition motif of acidic activation domains for hTAFII31.

8001121|a|We show that the presence of a regulatory cis-acting element that flanks the core octamer site and dictates selectivity in the response to Vmw65 (VP16), while dispensable for POU binding per se, induces a conformational alteration in the nature of the POU domain in the DNA complex. A single substitution in the flanking signal distorts the POU complex and without affecting overall POU binding prevents Vmw65 interaction. Alternatively, substitution of a residue in the homeodomain predicted to contact the GARAT region prevents its recognition even on a wild-type motif, causing a reversion to the DNA binding pattern seen on a cellular motif and at the same time inefficient recognition by Vmw65. The results indicate that Vmw65 recognizes a particular POU domain conformation induced by the presence of the flanking GARAT region.

2541050|a|Vmw65 is a structural component of herpes simplex virus which, in conjunction with host factors, trans-activates the expression of the viral immediate-early genes. In order to examine the relationship between the primary structure of Vmw65 and its trans-activating function, we generated in-frame insertion, deletion, and nonsense mutations in a cloned copy of the gene. The ability of the mutant polypeptides to function as transcriptional activators was assessed by transient transfection of Vero cells using, as the reporter gene, the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene linked to the promoter-regulatory region from the HSV-1 immediate-early gene coding for Vmw175. These studies have demonstrated that a highly acidic region near the C-terminus of Vmw65 as well as the structural integrity of several other regions of the polypeptide are essential for its transactivating properties, whereas a small region near the N-terminus of the polypeptide is dispensible for activity. Finally, in vivo competition studies using inactive deletion mutants suggest that a domain of the polypeptide located between amino acids 141 and 185 may be involved in protein-protein interactions.

8392914|a|Upon lytic infection of permissive cells, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) transactivator protein VP16 associates with an accessory protein termed host cell factor (HCF). Binding to HCF activates VP16 for association with the octamer motif-binding protein Oct-1, to form a multiprotein-DNA complex responsible for activating transcription of the HSV immediate early genes. We show that HCF comprises a series of related polypeptides that range from 110 to 300 kd, all of which are encoded by a single gene. Although there is no obvious sequence similarity between HCF and other known proteins, HCF contains eight repeats of a new 26 amino acid motif. cDNAs encoding HCF predict a large open reading frame of 2035 codons. When expressed in human cells, this large open reading frame encodes both the 300 kd and smaller HCF polypeptides, indicating that the smaller polypeptides arise by processing of the 300 kd protein.

9315674|a|The herpes simplex virus (HSV) regulatory protein VP16 activates HSV immediate-early gene transcription through formation of a multiprotein-DNA complex on viral promoters that includes the preexisting nuclear proteins HCF and Oct-1. The HCF protein is a complex of amino- and carboxy-terminal polypeptides derived from a large (approximately 2,000-amino-acid) precursor by proteolytic processing. Here we show that a 361-residue amino-terminal region of HCF is sufficient to bind VP16, stabilize VP16-induced complex assembly with Oct-1 and DNA, and activate transcription in vivo. This VP16 interaction region contains six kelch-like repeats, a degenerate repeat motif that is likely to fold as a distinctive beta-propeller structure. The third HCF kelch repeat includes a proline residue (P134) that is mutated to serine in hamster tsBN67 cells, resulting in a temperature-sensitive defect in cell proliferation. This missense mutation also prevents direct association between HCF and VP16, suggesting that VP16 mimics a cellular factor required for cell proliferation. Rescue of the tsBN67 cell proliferation defect by HCF, however, requires both the VP16 interaction domain and an adjacent basic region, indicating that HCF utilizes multiple regions to promote cell cycle progression.

8164693|a|VP16 is a herpes simplex virus (HSV)-encoded transcriptional activator protein that is essential for efficient viral replication and as such may be a target for novel therapeutic agents directed against viral gene expression. We have reconstituted transcriptional activation by VP16 in an in vitro system that is dependent on DNA sequences from HSV immediate-early gene promoters and on protein-protein interactions between VP16 and Oct-1 that are required for VP16 activation in vivo. Activation increased synergistically with the number of TAATGARAT elements (the cis-acting element for VP16 activation in vivo) upstream of the core promoter, and mutations of this element that reduce Oct-1 or VP16 DNA binding reduced transactivation in vitro. A VP16 insertion mutant unable to interact with Oct-1 was inactive, but, surprisingly, a deletion mutant lacking the activation domain was approximately 65% as active as the full-length protein. The activation domains of Oct-1 were necessary for activation in reactions containing the VP16 deletion mutant, and they contributed significantly to activation by full-length VP16. Addition of a GA-rich element present in many HSV immediate-early gene enhancers synergistically stimulated VP16-activated transcription. Finally, oligopeptides that are derived from a region of VP16 thought to contact a cellular factor known as HCF (host cell factor) and that inhibit efficient VP16 binding to the TAATGARAT element also specifically inhibited VP16-activated, but not basal, transcription. Amino acid substitutions in one of these peptides identified three residues that are absolutely required for inhibition and presumably for interaction of VP16 with HCF.

9083114|a|During the cell cycle, cells progress through four distinct phases, G1, S, G2 and M; transcriptional controls play an important role at the transition between these phases. MCB-binding factor (MBF), a transcription factor from budding yeast, binds to the so-called MCB (MluI cell-cycle box) elements found in the promoters of many DNA synthesis genes, and activates the transcription of those at the G1-->S phase transition. MBF is comprised of two proteins, Mbp1 and Swi6.The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of Mbp1 has been determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction from crystals of the selenomethionyl variant of the protein. The structure is composed of a six-stranded beta sheet interspersed with two pairs of alpha helices. The most conserved core region among Mbp1-related transcription factors folds into a central helix-turn-helix motif with a short N-terminal beta strand and a C-terminal beta hairpin.Despite little sequence similarity, the structure within the core region of the Mbp1 N-terminal domain exhibits a similar fold to that of the DNA-binding domains of other proteins, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor-3gamma and histone H5 from eukaryotes, and the prokaryotic catabolite gene activator. However, the structure outside the core region defines Mbp1 as a larger entity with substructures that stabilize and display the helix-turn-helix motif.

8397281|a|The DNA sequence of an 8.4 kbp BamHI-EcoRI fragment of Marek's disease virus (MDV) strain GA was determined. Three of the predicted polypeptides are homologous to UL47, UL48 and UL49 encoding the major tegument proteins of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and four are homologous to HSV-1 UL45, UL46, UL49.5 and UL50. These seven genes are found in the long unique region of the MDV genome and are collinear with homologues in HSV-1 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Northern blot analysis revealed different transcriptional patterns from those of HSV-1 and VZV. MDV homologues of UL49.5, UL49 and UL47 lack a poly(A) signal immediately downstream of their coding regions. Amino acid conservation between MDV and HSV-1, and between MDV and VZV is as high as that between HSV-1 and VZV. The MDV homologue of UL48 shows 60% similarity to its HSV-1 counterpart. Amino acid sequence comparison reveals that the MDV homologue of UL48 lacks an acidic carboxyl terminus. This homologue, like the VZV homologue of UL48, may be involved in the trans-activation of immediate early genes and may function as an important component of the structural proteins.

7835942|a|Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is known to play a major role in resistance to Salmonella typhimurium infection. In this study, the IFN-gamma production in spleens of mice infected with S. typhimurium was analysed at the single cell level using an ELISPOT method. The in vivo IFN-gamma production during the early phase of infection with virulent and avirulent S. typhimurium strains was examined in four mouse strains. Data show that infection with a virulent strain of S. typhimurium caused a much greater enhancement in the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing cells in innately resistant (ltyr) mice (CBA and DBA/2) than in susceptible (ltys) mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). In contrast, infection with an avirulent strain of S. typhimurium induced a clear increase in the number of IFN-gamma-producing cells in susceptible mice which was even greater than in resistant ones. These results indicate that both the host genetic background and bacterial virulence play a critical role in the regulation of IFN-gamma production during the early phase of S. typhimurium infection.

1816488|a|Although IFN-gamma has been shown to play an important role in protection against a systemic S. typhimurium challenge, the in vivo and in vitro production of this cytokine following S. typhimurium infection of the gastrointestinal tract has not been investigated. In this study, IFN-gamma production by gut-associated lymphoid tissue and spleen was investigated in mice following oral challenge with S. typhimurium. Cells obtained from the Peyer's patches (PP), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and spleen (Sp) of mice orally challenged with S. typhimurium were assessed for levels of IFN-gamma mRNA after varying times following in vivo infection. RNA obtained from the above tissues was subjected to reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification using primers specific for murine IFN-gamma. Elevated levels of IFN-gamma mRNA were first detected in the PP at 6 h post-challenge. Elevated levels of IFN-gamma mRNA were then detected in the MLN at 24 h and in the spleen at 4 days post-challenge. These in vivo results were in agreement with the ability of these lymphoid tissues to produce IFN-gamma upon in vitro stimulation with killed S. typhimurium. Neutralization of endogenously produced IFN-gamma by administration of mAb to IFN-gamma completely abrogated resistance to an oral challenge of S. typhimurium. A significant difference in the percent mortality was observed between the antibody-treated and control groups. Evaluation of bacterial spread in the antibody treated group versus the control group at 4 days following oral challenge revealed higher numbers of bacteria in the spleen and liver of antibody treated mice. These results clearly show that IFN-gamma is rapidly produced by gut-associated lymphoid tissue and spleen following oral S. typhimurium infection, and that endogenous production of IFN-gamma is essential in host resistance to S. typhimurium.

A single injection of recombinant murine gamma interferon (rMuIFN-gamma) protected neonatal mice from simultaneous challenge with a lethal dose of L. monocytogenes cells. The rMuIFN-gamma effect was dose dependent: protection was consistently observed in mice treated with rMuIFN-gamma at doses of more than 4 X 10(2) U (0.1 microgram of protein) per mouse. Bacterial growth in the spleens and livers of rMuIFN-gamma-treated neonates was significantly suppressed in comparison with that in the nontreated controls.

1730475|a|In mice infected with a sublethal dose of Salmonella typhimurium, the injection of an anti-gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) monoclonal antibody increased bacterial proliferation in the spleen and led to death on day 7 or 8. Depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with monoclonal antibodies in vivo had a much less marked effect during the first week of infection than the administration of anti-IFN-gamma antibodies, suggesting that cells other than T lymphocytes participate in the production of IFN-gamma at this time. Administration of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antibodies to mice infected with a sublethal dose of S. typhimurium induced the same effect as anti-IFN-gamma antibodies, while the administration of both antibodies resulted in a synergistic interaction. When mice were infected with an avirulent strain of S. typhimurium and challenged on day 7 either with a virulent strain of S. typhimurium or with Listeria monocytogenes, their resistance to reinfection was slightly depressed by anti-IFN-gamma or anti-TNF-alpha antibodies given 1 day before challenge and much more strongly depressed by the simultaneous administration of both antibodies. Taken together, these results indicate that IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha play an essential role in acquired resistance during the early phase of S. typhimurium infection.

8617956|a|Due to the dependency on aromatic precursors, the growth of Salmonella typhimurium aroA- is limited in immunocompetent mice. Here we show that H-21-A beta-/- mice (lacking MHC class II molecules and thus devoid of mature CD4+ TCR-alpha beta cells), TCR-beta-/- mice (devoid of TCR-alpha beta cells), and IFN-gamma R-/- mice (unresponsive to IFN-gamma) are highly susceptible to S. typhimurium aroA- infection compared with heterozygous controls. In contrast, beta 2m-deficient mice (lacking surface MHC class I and thus devoid of conventional CD8+ T cells) or TCR-delta-/- mice (devoid of TCR-gamma delta cells) were equally as resistant to S. typhimurium aroA- infection as their heterozygous littermates. These findings emphasize the vital role of CD4+ TCR-alpha beta cells and IFN-gamma in resistance against S. typhimurium aroA-. Sublethal inocula of S. typhimurium aroA- led to permanent infection in H-21-A beta-/- mice, suggesting that bacterial starvation is insufficient for sterile clearance in immunocompetent mice and that MHC class II-dependent immune mechanisms are required for pathogen eradication. The TCR-beta-/- mice suffered from salmonellosis more severely than the MHC class II-deficient mutants, suggesting an auxiliary function of CD8+ T cells. Recombinant S. typhimurium aroA-, secreting listeriolysin (Hly) of Listeria monocytogenes, are capable of escaping from the phagosome into the cytosol of the host cell. However, the course of infection of these recombinant S. typhimurium SL7207 Hlys and control strains did not differ in beta 2m-/- mutants. This finding argues against direct correlation of cytosolic location of S. typhimurium SL7207 Hlys with CD8+ T cell dependency of protection.

The study described in this report suggest that S. typhimurium delta aro mutants have the capacity to induce MHC class I-restricted CTL against carried antigens and that MHC class I-restricted CTL responses require stable in vivo expression of the target antigen. Further, the results indicate that the Salmonella typhi delta aro mutants currently undergoing evaluation in studies with humans may be good carriers of viral antigens with CTL determinants.

9741339|a|Two lineages of B cells, designated B1 and B2 cells, have been identified based upon their origins, anatomical distribution, cell surface markers, antibody repertoire and self-replenishing potential. B1 cells are maintained by self-renewal of cells resident in the peritoneal cavity (PerC) and they utilize a limited repertoire of germline V-region genes, mostly directed against ubiquitous bacterial antigens such as phosphoryl choline (PC). B2 cells are replenished from bone marrow precursors and use a larger repertoire of immunoglobulin V-region genes. Whereas most immunoglobulin A (IgA) plasma cells in the intestine derive from B2 lineage precursors in the Peyer's patch, a subpopulation of Per C-derived B1 cells populate the intestinal lamina propria where they mature into IgA plasma cells. In previous in vivo studies we have shown that whereas IgA+ B2 cells are interleukin (IL)-6 dependent, B1 cells are IL-6 independent. In view of the in vitro evidence that IL-5 is also involved in IgA expression, in the studies reported here we have used IL-5-deficient mice to evaluate the role of IL-5 in vivo in IgA expression in the gut. The results demonstrate that although total IgA cell numbers are only marginally depressed in IL-5-deficient mice, there is a marked selective depletion of IgA+ cells of the B1 lineage in the gut and a corresponding depression in the capacity of these mice to mount an intestinal response to a B1 antigen (PC) but not to a B2 antigen (oralbumin; OVA), reflecting intact B2-derived IgA cell function but a defect in the B1 cell contribution to IgA responses in IL-5 deficient mice. Collectively these data demonstrate differential cytokine regulation of subsets of IgA+ cells in the gut in that IgA+ cells of the B2 lineage are IL-6 dependent but IL-5 independent, but B1-derived IgA+ cells are IL-5 dependent and IL-6 independent.

The binding of phycoerytherin-labeled anti-alpha4 mAb to blood T cells from PS/2-treated mice was reduced, implying that alpha4 sites were already occupied. T cells and eosinophils in BAL fluid from mice treated with PS/2 or MK2 were phenotypically different from controls. Selective decreases of alpha4+ T cells in the BAL fluid after PS/2 or MK2 treatment were coupled with changes in CD8+, CD11a, and CD62L expression. The alpha4-integrin and VCAM-1 may have important roles in the antigen-induced recruitment of T cells and eosinophils during OA-induced airway inflammation. The data suggest that these adhesion molecules may be suitable targets for therapeutic intervention in certain conditions of pulmonary inflammation.

7530745|a|Astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) associate intimately with vascular endothelial cells and are integral to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leukocyte transmigration across the BBB is a cardinal feature of CNS inflammation, as observed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4)/vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) interactions have recently been proposed as essential for this process. VCAM-1 expression by astrocytes was recently reported. We addressed the regulation of VCAM-1 expression by inflammatory cytokines in primary human astrocytes and two human astrocytoma cell lines. Astrocytoma cells up-regulated surface VCAM-1 expression in response to cytokines in the following order: IFN-gamma plus TNF-alpha > IFN-gamma plus IL-1 beta > TNF-alpha > IFN-gamma. Cytokine-activated astrocytoma cells expressed 7-domain VCAM-1, as indicated by accumulation of 3.2-kb VCAM-1 mRNA and immunoprecipitation of a 100-kDa protein with anti-VCAM-1 mAb. Lymphoblast adhesion to cytokine-activated astrocytoma cell monolayers was significantly blocked by mAb specific for VCAM-1 and VLA-4, indicating that astrocytoma cell VCAM-1 was functional. Astrocytoma cell expression of VCAM-1 could be a constituent of the astrocyte phenotype. To support this possibility, we demonstrated that cytokine-treated adult human and rat primary astrocytes expressed VCAM-1, and the rank order of cytokine potency for VCAM-1 induction in primary and neoplastic astrocytes was strikingly similar. This is the first documentation of VCAM-1 expression by adult human astrocytes. Expression of VCAM-1 by astrocytes at the BBB could play a role in mononuclear leukocyte entry into the CNS.

2104898|a|We have demonstrated recently that rIFN-gamma inhibits the proliferation of murine bone marrow cells stimulated with rIL-3 or recombinant granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF. In light of this finding, three murine CD8+ CTL clones whose supernatants had been shown previously not to contain detectable levels of CSF activity but which contained a relatively high level of IFN-gamma were reassessed for their ability to secrete IL-3 and GM-CSF. Supernatants from CTL clones activated with anti-CD3 mAb failed to stimulate the IL-3-dependent cell line FDCP1. However, these supernatants were indeed able to stimulate the proliferation of FDCP1 cells if anti-IFN-gamma mAb was present. This stimulatory activity was specifically neutralized by anti-IL-3 mAb. Supernatants from two of the three clones stimulated the proliferation of a GM-CSF-responsive HT-2 cell line, and this activity was neutralized by anti-GM-CSF antibody. The otherwise modest ability of CTL supernatants to stimulate the proliferation of fresh bone marrow cells was augmented considerably in the presence of anti-IFN-gamma mAb, and this activity was appropriately blocked by anti-IL-3 and anti-GM-CSF antibodies. mRNA for IL-3 and GM-CSF, as well as for IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, was detected in cells that secreted those lymphokines, and the time course of appearance of each mRNA correlated with secretion of the appropriate lymphokine activity. However, the time course of mRNA accumulation for each lymphokine was distinct, the order of expression of these genes apparently being TNF-alpha, then IFN-gamma and GM-CSF, and finally IL-3. Our results emphasize that potential interactions among lymphokines must be considered when interpreting data obtained from lymphokine bioassays and suggest an immunoregulatory role for CTL through the secretion of several of the same lymphokines produced by HTL.

1533240|a|Ly-1 B cells have the distinctive property of continuous self-replenishment and, as we have shown previously, can be further distinguished from conventional B cells on the basis of greatly elevated constitutive and inducible production of the recently described cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10). To test the possibility that IL-10 acts as either an autocrine or paracrine growth factor for Ly-1 B cells, we treated mice continuously from birth to 8 wk of age with a monoclonal rat IgM antibody that specifically neutralizes mouse IL-10. Mice treated in this way lacked peritoneal-resident Ly-1 B cells, contained greatly reduced serum immunoglobulin M levels, and were unable to generate significant in vivo antibody responses to intraperitoneal injections of alpha 1,3-dextran or phosphorylcholine, antigens for which specific B cells reside in the Ly-1 B cell subset. In contrast, conventional splenic B cells of anti-IL-10-treated mice were normal with respect to total numbers, phenotype, and in vitro responsiveness to B cell mitogens and the thymus-dependent antigen trinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (TNP-KLH). The mechanism of Ly-1 B cell depletion appeared to be related to elevation of endogenous interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) levels in anti-IL-10-treated mice, since coadministration of neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma antibodies substantially restored the number of peritoneal-resident Ly-1 B cells in these mice. These results implicate IL-10 as a regulator of Ly-1 B cell development, and identify a procedure to specifically deplete Ly-1 B cells, thereby allowing further evaluation of the role of these cells in the immune system.

7688142|a|Ribozymes are an important new class of metalloenzymes that have an unlikely feature: they are made entirely of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Metal ions are essential for efficient chemical catalysis by ribozymes and are often required for the stabilization of ribozyme structure. Most ribozymes catalyze reactions at phosphorus centers through one of two major mechanistic pathways, and reaction has been observed at carbon centers. Creative experiments have revealed the position of metal ions in the active site of two ribozymes. The exploitation of variable metal geometry and reactivity has expanded ribozyme chemistry and has facilitated the application of in vitro selection for the creation of novel ribozymes.

8422972|a|Three well-characterized RNA catalysts not only require Mg2+ for activity, but also bind a metal ion (or ions) within the active site, apparently in a catalytic rather than solely structural role. I suggest, in view of the general catalytic utility of bound ions, that catalytic RNAs be viewed as Cheshire cats, by dimming their complex three-dimensional ribonucleotide structure to leave only the sharp mineral parts in view. That is, catalytic RNAs may be viewed as metalloenzymes, with the burdens of catalysis frequently borne by specifically poised metal ions. Comparison to modern protein metalloenzymes predicts particular RNA metallocatalysts that may be possible presently, and in a hypothetical ancestral RNA world that did not encode peptide catalysts. In support of this view, known catalytic RNAs can be considered Cheshire catalysts; that is, they have apparent cognates among the protein metalloenzymes.

In addition, a solvent deuterium isotope effect has been taken as evidence against a proton transfer in the rate-limiting step of the cleavage reaction. We propose that these data are more easily explained by a two-metal-ion mechanism that does not involve a metal hydroxide, but does involve a proton transfer in the rate-limiting step.

9405614|a|In a previous examination using natural all-RNA substrates that contained either a 5'-oxy or 5'-thio leaving group at the cleavage site, we demonstrated that (i) the attack by the 2'-oxygen at C17 on the phosphorus atom is the rate-limiting step only for the substrate that contains a 5'-thio group (R11S) and (ii) the departure of the 5' leaving group is the rate-limiting step for the natural all-RNA substrate (R11O) in both nonenzymatic and hammerhead ribozyme-catalyzed reactions; the energy diagrams for these reactions were provided in our previous publication. In this report we found that the rate of cleavage of R11O by a hammerhead ribozyme was enhanced 14-fold when Mg2+ ions were replaced by Mn2+ ions, whereas the rate of cleavage of R11S was enhanced only 2.2-fold when Mg2+ ions were replaced by Mn2+ ions. This result appears to be exactly the opposite of that predicted from the direct coordination of the metal ion with the leaving 5'-oxygen, because a switch in metal ion specificity was not observed with the 5'-thio substrate. However, our quantitative analyses based on the previously provided energy diagram indicate that this result is in accord with the double-metal-ion mechanism of catalysis.

9435228|a|Evidence for a two-metal ion mechanism for cleavage of the HH16 hammerhead ribozyme is provided by monitoring the rate of cleavage of the RNA substrate as a function of La3+ concentration in the presence of a constant concentration of Mg2+. We show that a bell-shaped curve of cleavage activation is obtained as La3+ is added in micromolar concentrations in the presence of 8 mM Mg2+, with a maximal rate of cleavage being attained in the presence of 3 microM La3+. These results show that two-metal ion binding sites on the ribozyme regulate the rate of the cleavage reaction and, on the basis of earlier estimates of the Kd values for Mg2+ of 3.5 mM and > 50 mM, that these sites bind La3+ with estimated Kd values of 0.9 and > 37.5 microM, respectively. Furthermore, given the very different effects of these metal ions at the two binding sites, with displacement of Mg2+ by La3+ at the stronger (relative to Mg2+) binding site activating catalysis and displacement of Mg2+ by La3+ at the weaker (relative to Mg2+) (relative to Mg2+) binding site inhibiting catalysis, we show that the metal ions at these two sites play very different roles. We argue that the metal ion at binding site 1 coordinates the attacking 2'-oxygen species in the reaction and lowers the pKa of the attached proton, thereby increasing the concentration of the attacking alkoxide nucleophile in an equilibrium process. In contrast, the role of the metal ion at binding site 2 is to catalyze the reaction by absorbing the negative charge that accumulates at the leaving 5'-oxygen in the transition state. We suggest structural reasons why the Mg(2+)-La3+ ion combination is particularly suited to demonstrating these different roles of the two-metal ions in the ribozyme cleavage reaction.

They catalyse a site-specific transesterification reaction in which their 2' hydroxyl attacks the 3' phosphate, with the exclusion of the 5' oxyanion. This requires an in-line geometry, which is not present in normal RNA structure. A significant part of the activation is probably provided by a distortion of the local conformation in order to facilitate the trajectory into the transition state and, thus, RNA folding and catalysis are intimately connected. A second element of the catalysis is provided by bound metal ions; however, a number of recent experiments cast doubt on the direct role of metal ions in the catalytic chemistry.

10572011|a|The hammerhead ribozyme crystal structure identified a specific metal ion binding site referred to as the P9/G10.1 site. Although this metal ion binding site is approximately 20 A away from the cleavage site, its disruption is highly deleterious for catalysis. Additional published results have suggested that the pro-R(P) oxygen at the cleavage site is coordinated by a metal ion in the reaction's transition state. Herein, we report a study on Cd(2+) rescue of the deleterious phosphorothioate substitution at the cleavage site. Under all conditions, the Cd(2+) concentration dependence can be accounted for by binding of a single rescuing metal ion. The affinity of the rescuing Cd(2+) is sensitive to perturbations at the P9/G10.1 site but not at the cleavage site or other sites in the conserved core. These observations led to a model in which a metal ion bound at the P9/G10.1 site in the ground state acquires an additional interaction with the cleavage site prior to and in the transition state. A titration experiment ruled out the possibility that a second tight-binding metal ion (< 10 microM) is involved in the rescue, further supporting the single metal ion model. Additionally, weakening Cd(2+) binding at the P9/G10.1 site did not result in the biphasic binding curve predicted from other models involving two metal ions. The large stereospecific thio-effects at the P9/G10.1 and the cleavage site suggest that there are interactions with these oxygen atoms in the normal reaction that are compromised by replacement of oxygen with sulfur. The simplest interpretation of the substantial rescue by Cd(2+) is that these atoms interact with a common metal ion in the normal reaction. Furthermore, base deletions and functional group modifications have similar energetic effects on the transition state in the Cd(2+)-rescued phosphorothioate reaction and the wild-type reaction, further supporting the model that a metal ion bridges the P9/G10.1 and the cleavage site in the normal reaction (i.e., with phosphate linkages rather than phosphorothioate linkages). These results suggest that the hammerhead undergoes a substantial conformational rearrangement to attain its catalytic conformation. Such rearrangements appear to be general features of small functional RNAs, presumably reflecting their structural limitations.

9818150|a|The catalytic activity of RNA enzymes is thought to require divalent metal ions, which are believed to facilitate RNA folding and to play a direct chemical role in the reaction.We have found that the hammerhead, hairpin and VS ribozymes do not require divalent metal ions, their mimics such as [Co(NH3)6]3+, or even monovalent metal ions for efficient self-cleavage. The HDV ribozyme, however, does appear to require divalent metal ions for self-cleavage. For the hammerhead, hairpin and VS ribozymes, very high concentrations of monovalent cations support RNA-cleavage rates similar to or exceeding those observed in standard concentrations of Mg2+. Analysis of all reaction components by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrophotometry (ICPOES) and the use of a variety of chelating agents effectively eliminate the possibility of contaminating divalent and trivalent metal ions in the reactions. For the hairpin ribozyme, fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments demonstrate that high concentrations of monovalent cations support folding into the catalytically proficient tertiary structure.These results directly demonstrate that metal ions are not obligatory chemical participants in the reactions catalysed by the hammerhead, hairpin, and VS ribozymes. They permit us to suggest that the folded structure of the RNA itself contributes more to the catalytic function than was previously recognised, and that the presence of a relatively dense positive charge, rather than divalent metal ions, is the general fundamental requirement. Whether this charge is required for catalysis per se or simply for RNA folding remains to be determined.

1716459|a|A hammerhead self-cleaving domain composed of two oligoribonucleotides was used to study the role of divalent metal ions in the cleavage reaction. Cleavage rates were measured as a function of MgCl2, MnCl2, and CaCl2 concentration in the absence or presence of spermine. In the presence of spermine, the rate vs metal ion concentration curves are broader, and lower concentrations of divalent ions are necessary for catalytic activity. This suggests that spermine can promote proper folding of the hammerhead and one or more divalent ions are required for the reaction. Six additional divalent ions were tested for their ability to support hammerhead cleavage. In the absence of spermine, rapid cleavage was observed with Co2+ while very slow cleavage occurred with Sr2+ and Ba2+. No detectable specific cleavage was observed with Cd2+, Zn2+, or Pb2+. However, in the presence of 0.5 mM spermine, rapid cleavage was observed with Zn2+ and Cd2+, and the rate with Sr2+ was increased, indicating that while these three ions could not promote proper folding of the hammerhead they were able to stimulate cleavage. These results suggest certain divalent ions either participate directly in the cleavage mechanism or are specifically involved in stabilizing the tertiary structure of the hammerhead. Additionally, an altered divalent metal ion specificity was observed when a unique phosphorothioate linkage was inserted at the cleavage site. The substitution of a sulfur for a nonbridging oxygen atom substantially reduced the affinity of an important Mg2+ ion necessary for efficient cleavage. In contrast, the reaction proceeds normally with Mn2+, presumably due to its ability to coordinate with both oxygen and sulfur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Nat. Acad. Sci. USA (1990) 87 (in press)]. These transesterification reactions generate a 2',3'-cyclophosphate and a 5'-hydroxyl as the two new end groups. Cleavage is at a CpA for the (+) polarity RNA and at an ApG for the (-) polarity RNA. We enzymically synthesized oligoribonucleotides with processing capability and with specific 35S-labeled phosphorothioate diesters in the Rp configuration. After processing had occurred, the terminal nucleoside-2',3'-cyclophosphorothioate diester residues were recovered from the appropriate product by digestion with nuclease and phosphatase. Comparisons with specially prepared endo- and exoisomer reference compounds by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography revealed that the [35S]cytidine- and [35S]adenosine-2',3'-cyclophosphorothioate both were endo-isomers.

This finding gives further evidence for the hypothesis that the magnesium ion is bound to the pro-R oxygen in the transition state of the hammerhead cleavage reaction.

2036380|a|Mg2+ is important for the RNase activity of the hammerhead ribozyme. To investigate the binding properties of Mg2+ to the hammerhead ribozyme, cleavage rates and CD spectra for substrates containing inosine or guanosine at the cleavage site were measured. The 2-amino group of this guanosine interfered with the rate of the cleavage reaction and did not affect the amount of Mg2+ bound to the hammerhead RNA. The kinetics and CD spectra for chemically synthesized oligoribonucleotides with a Sp or Rp phosphorothioate diester bond at the cleavage site indicated that 1 mol of Mg2+ binds to the pro-R oxygen of phosphate. The binding constant for Mg2+ was about 10(4) M-1, which represents outer-sphere complexation. The hammerhead ribozyme catalyzes the cleavage reaction via an in-line pathway. This mechanism has been proved for RNA cleavage by RNase A by using a modified oligonucleotide that has an Sp phosphorothionate bond at the cleavage site. From these results, we present the reaction pathway and a model for Mg2+ binding to the hammerhead ribozyme.

9862968|a|The effect of introducing a phosphorothioate at the hammerhead cleavage site was investigated using a kinetically well-characterized hammerhead. In buffers containing Mg ion, the RP-phosphorothioate isomer cleaved 2000- to 80 000-fold slower than the SPisomer or the unmodified RNA substrate. Addition of low concentrations of several thiophilic metal ions, especially Cd2+, to these reactions is sufficient to fully restore the cleavage rate of the RPsubstrate without affecting cleavage rate of the all-oxygen or SPsubstrate. Thus, a model proposing coordination of a divalent metal ion to the pro-R oxygen at the hammerhead cleavage site appears justified.

8421499|a|All catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) require or are stimulated by divalent metal ions, but it has been difficult to separate the contribution of these metal ions to formation of the RNA tertiary structure from a more direct role in catalysis. The Tetrahymena ribozyme catalyses cleavage of exogenous RNA or DNA substrates with an absolute requirement for Mg2+ or Mn2+ (ref. 6). A DNA substrate, in which the bridging 3' oxygen atom at the cleavage site is replaced by sulphur, is cleaved by the ribozyme about 1,000 times more slowly than the corresponding unmodified DNA substrate when Mg2+ is present as the only divalent metal ion. But addition of Mn2+ or Zn2+ to the reaction relieves this negative effect, with the 3' S-P bond being cleaved nearly as fast as the 3' O-P bond. Considering that Mn2+ and Zn2+ coordinate sulphur more strongly than Mg2+ does, these results indicate that the metal ion contributes directly to catalysis by coordination to the 3' oxygen atom in the transition state, presumably stabilizing the developing negative charge on the leaving group. We conclude that the Tetrahymena ribozyme is a metalloenzyme, with mechanistic similarities to several protein enzymes.

7542746|a|We have previously shown, using phosphorothioate substitutions at splice site, that both transesterification steps of group II intron self-splicing proceed, by stereochemical inversion, with an Sp but not an Rp phosphorothioate. Under alternative reaction conditions or with various intron fragments, group II introns can splice following hydrolysis at the 5' splice site and can also hydrolyze the bond between spliced exons (the spliced-exon reopening reaction). In this study, we have determined the stereochemical specificities of all of the major model hydrolytic reactions carried out by the aI5 gamma intron from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria. For all substrates containing exon 1 and most of the intron, the stereospecificity of hydrolysis is the same as for the step 1 transesterification reaction. In contrast, the spliced-exon reopening reaction proceeds with an Rp but not an Sp phosphorothioate at the scissile bond, as does true reverse splicing. Thus, by stereochemistry, this reaction appears to be related to the reverse of step 2 of self-splicing. Finally, a substrate RNA that contains the first exon and nine nucleotides of the intron, when reacted with the intron ribozyme, releases the first exon regardless of the configuration of the phosphorothioate at the 5' splice site, suggesting that this substrate can be cleaved by either the step 1 or the step 2 reaction site. Our findings clarify the relationships of these model reactions to the transesterification reactions of the intact self-splicing system and permit new studies to be interpreted more rigorously.

9285596|a|Although only a subset of protein enzymes depend on the presence of a metal ion for their catalytic function, all naturally occurring RNA enzymes require metal ions to stabilize their structure and for catalytic competence. In the self-splicing group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila, several divalent metals can serve structural roles, but only Mg2+ and Mn2+ promote splice-site cleavage and exon ligation. A study of a ribozyme reaction analogous to 5'-splice-site cleavage by guanosine uncovered the first metal ion with a definitive role in catalysis. Substitution of the 3'-oxygen of the leaving group with sulphur resulted in a metal-specificity switch, indicating an interaction between the leaving group and the metal ion. Here we use 3'-(thioinosylyl)-(3'-->5')-uridine, IspU, as a substrate in a reaction that emulates exon ligation. Activity requires the addition of a thiophilic metal ion (Cd2+ or Mn2+), providing evidence for stabilization of the leaving group by a metal ion in that step of splicing. Based on the principle of microscopic reversibility, this metal ion activates the nucleophilic 3'-hydroxyl of guanosine in the first step of splicing, supporting the model of a two-metal-ion active site.

9285595|a|The removal of intervening sequences from premessenger RNA is essential for the expression of most eukaryotic genes. The spliceosome ribonucleoprotein complex catalyses intron removal by two sequential phosphotransesterification reactions, but the catalytic mechanisms are unknown. It has been proposed that two divalent metal ions may mediate catalysis of both reaction steps, activating the 2'- or 3'-hydroxyl groups for nucleophilic attack and stabilizing the 3'-oxyanion leaving groups by direct coordination. Here we show that in splicing reactions with a precursor RNA containing a 3'-sulphur substitution at the 5' splice site, interaction between metal ion and leaving group is essential for catalysis of the first reaction step. This establishes that the spliceosome is a metalloenzyme and demonstrates a direct parallel with the catalytic strategy used by the self-splicing group I intron from Tetrahymena. In contrast, 3'-sulphur substitution at the 3' splice site provides no evidence for a metal ion-leaving group interaction in the second reaction step, suggesting that the two steps of splicing proceed by different catalytic mechanisms and therefore in distinct active sites.

10398685|a|The identical reaction pathway executed by the spliceosome and self-splicing group II intron ribozymes has prompted the idea that both may be derived from a common molecular ancestor. The minimal sequence and structural similarities between group II introns and the spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs, however, have left this proposal in question. Mechanistic comparisons between group II self-splicing introns and the spliceosome are therefore important in determining whether these two splicing machineries may be related. Here we show that 3'-sulfur substitution at the 5' splice site of a group II intron causes a metal specificity switch during the first step of splicing. In contrast, 3'-sulfur substitution has no significant effect on the metal specificity of the second step of cis-splicing. Isolation of the second step uncovers a metal specificity switch that is masked during the cis-splicing reaction. These results demonstrate that group II intron ribozymes are metalloenzymes that use a catalytic metal ion for leaving group stabilization during both steps of self-splicing. Furthermore, because 3'-sulfur substitution of a spliceosomal intron has precisely the same effects as were observed during cis-splicing of the group II intron, these results provide striking parallels between the catalytic mechanisms employed by these two systems.

10637323|a|Endonucleolytic processing of precursor tRNAs (ptRNAs) by RNase P yields 3'-OH and 5'-phosphate termini, and at least two metal ions are thought to be essential for catalysis. To determine if the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by bacterial RNase P (RNAs) involves stabilization of the 3'-oxyanion leaving group by direct coordination to one of the catalytic metal ions, ptRNA substrates with single 3'- S -phosphorothiolate linkages at the RNase P cleavage site were synthesized. With a 3'- S -phosphorothiolate-modified ptRNA carrying a 7 nt 5'-flank, a complete shift of the cleavage site to the next unmodified phosphodiester in the 5'-direction was observed. Cleavage at the modified linkage was not restored in the presence of thiophilic metal ions, such as Mn(2+)or Cd(2+). To suppress aberrant cleavage, we also constructed a 3'- S -phosphorothiolate-modified ptRNA with a 1 nt 5'-flank. No detectable cleavage of this substrate was seen in reactions catalyzed by RNase P RNAs from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, independent of the presence of thiophilic metal ions. Ground state binding of modified ptRNAs was not impaired, suggesting that the 3'- S -phosphorothiolate modification specifically prevents formation of the transition state, possibly by excluding catalytic metal ions from the active site.

9708893|a|Divalent metal ion-dependent hammerhead ribozymes can cleave any RNA with a NUX triplet, wherein the N can be any residue and X can be C, U or A. In recent literature on the mechanism of action of hammerhead ribozymes, one important role of divalent metal ions is generally suggested to be an electrophilic catalyst by directly coordinating with the pro-Rp oxygen of the scissile phosphate to stabilize the transition state. This proposal was made on the basis of thio effects and the proposed electrophilic catalyst is very attractive as an explanation for the catalytic activity of metalloenzymes. Reexamination of thio effects with substrates having a GUA triplet at the cleavage site shows that, in agreement with the previous finding, the cleavage rate, in the presence of Mg2+ ions, is significantly reduced in the case of the phosphorothioate substrate (RpS), wherein the pro-Rp oxygen at the scissile phosphate is replaced by sulfur, while the cleavage rate is reduced to a much lesser extent for the other isomer (SpS), wherein the pro-Sp oxygen at the scissile phosphate is replaced by sulfur. However, more careful examination of the rescue ability of Mn2+ ions with these isomers demonstrates that more thiophilic Mn2+ ions rescue the reaction not only with the RpS isomer but also with the SpS isomer and, importantly, to a greater extent for the SpS isomer. These results argue against the previous conclusion that a metal ion is directly coordinating with the pro-Rp oxygen of the scissile phosphate to stabilize the transition state. In this paper we try to elucidate the possible origin of the thio effects and propose a 'triester-like' mechanism in reactions catalyzed by hammerhead ribozymes.

6334536|a|Stability constants for the Mg2+ and Cd2+ complexes of ATP, ADP, ATP alpha S, ATP beta S, and ADP alpha S have been determined at 30 degrees C and mu = 0.1 M by 31P NMR. Besides being of the utmost importance for determining species distributions for enzymatic studies, these constants allow an estimation of the preference of Cd2+ for sulfur vs. oxygen coordination in phosphorothioate complexes. Stability constants for Mg2+ complexes decreases when sulfur replaces oxygen (log K: ADP, 4.11; ADP alpha S, 3.66; ATP, 4.70; ATP alpha S, 4.47; ATP beta S, 4.04) because of (a) a statistical factor resulting from the loss of one potential phosphate oxygen ligand and (b) either an alteration in the charge distribution between oxygen and sulfur or destabilization of the chelate ring structure by loss of an internal hydrogen bond between an oxygen of coordinated phosphate and metal-bound water. Cd2+ complexes with sulfur-substituted nucleotides are more stable than those without sulfur (log K: ADP, 3.58; ADP alpha S, 4.95; ATP, 4.36; ATP alpha S, 4.42; ATP beta S, 5.44) because of the preferential binding of Cd2+ to sulfur rather than oxygen, which we estimate to be approximately 60 in CdADP alpha S and CdATP beta S. The proportion of tridentate coordination is estimated to be 50-60% in MgATP and MgATP beta S, approximately 27% in MgATP alpha S, approximately 16% in CdATP or CdATP beta S, but approximately 75% in CdATP alpha S. By analysis of the data of Jaffe and Cohn [Jaffe, E. K., & Cohn, M. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10839], we conclude that the preference for oxygen over sulfur coordination to ATP beta S is 31 000 for Mg2+, 3100-3900 for Ca2+, and 158-193 for Mn2+. Proton NMR demonstrates that bidentate Cd2+ complexes form intramolecular chelates with the N-7 of adenine while Mg2+ nucleotides and the tridenate CdATP alpha S do not. An analysis of the 31P NMR line widths shows that the rate constants for dissociation of MgADP and MgATP are both 7000 s-1 while the association rate constants are 7 X 10(7) and 4 X 10(8) M-1 s-1, respectively. The observed dependence of the line width on nucleotide concentration is best explained by a base-stacking model at nucleotide concentrations above 5 mM.

9888810|a|The interaction of a divalent metal ion with a leaving 3' oxygen is a central component of several proposed mechanisms of phosphoryl transfer. In support of this are recent kinetic studies showing that thiophilic metal ions (e.g., Mn2+) stimulate the hydrolysis of compounds in which sulfur takes the place of the leaving oxygen. To examine the structural basis of this phenomenon, we have solved four crystal structures of single-stranded DNA's containing either oxygen or sulfur at a 3'-bridging position bound in conjunction with various metal ions at the 3'-5' exonucleolytic active site of the Klenow fragment (KF) of DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli. Two structures of normal ssDNA bound to KF in the presence of Zn2+ and Mn2+ or Zn2+ alone were refined at 2.6- and 2.25-A resolution, respectively. They serve as standards for comparison with other Mn2+- and Zn2+-containing structures. In these cases, Mn2+ and Zn2+ bind at metal ion site B in a nearly identical position to Mg2+ (Brautigam and Steitz (1998) J. Mol. Biol. 277, 363-377). Two structures of KF bound to a deoxyoligonucleotide that contained a 3'-bridging sulfur at the scissile phosphate were refined at 2.03-A resolution. Although the bridging sulfur compounds bind in a manner very similar to that of the normal oligonucleotides, the presence of the sulfur changes the metal ion binding properties of the active site such that Mn2+ and Zn2+ are observed at metal ion site B, but Mg2+ is not. It therefore appears that the ability of the bridging sulfur compounds to exclude nonthiophilic metal ions from metal ion site B explains the low activity of KF exonuclease on these substrates in the presence of Mg2+ (Curley et al. (1997) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119, 12691-12692) and that the 3'-bridging atom of the substrate is influencing the binding of metal ion B prior to catalysis.

7969422|a|The hammerhead ribozyme is a small catalytic RNA motif made up of three base-paired stems and a core of highly conserved, non-complementary nucleotides essential for catalysis. The X-ray crystallographic structure of a hammerhead RNA-DNA ribozyme-inhibitor complex at 2.6 A resolution reveals that the base-paired stems are A-form helices and that the core has two structural domains. The first domain is formed by the sequence 5'-CUGA following stem I and is a sharp turn identical to the uridine turn of transfer RNA, whereas the second is a non-Watson-Crick three-base-pair duplex with a divalent-ion binding site. The phosphodiester backbone of the DNA inhibitor strand is splayed out at the phosphate 5' to the cleavage site. The structure indicates that the ribozyme may destabilize a substrate strand in order to facilitate twisting of the substrate to allow cleavage of the scissile bond.

The conditions used differ from those in another recent solution in four significant ways: first, it is an all-RNA ribozyme rather than a DNA-RNA hybrid; second, the connectivity of the ribozyme backbone strands is different; third, the crystals were grown in the presence of a much lower concentration of salt; and fourth, the crystal packing scheme is very different. Nevertheless, the three-dimensional structure of the all-RNA hammerhead ribozyme is similar to the previous structure. Five potential Mg(II)-binding sites are identified, including one positioned near the ribozyme catalytic pocket. Upon this basis, as well as upon comparisons with the metal-binding sites in the structurally homologous uridine turn of tRNAPhe, we propose a mechanism for RNA catalytic cleavage.

This rearrangement brings the hammerhead ribozyme from the ground state into a conformation that is poised to form the transition state geometry required for hammerhead RNA self-cleavage. Use of a 5'-C-methylated ribose adjacent to the cleavage site permits this ordinarily transient conformational change to be kinetically trapped and observed crystallographically after initiating the hammerhead ribozyme reaction in the crystal. Cleavage of the corresponding unmodified hammerhead ribozyme in the crystal under otherwise identical conditions is faster than in solution, indicating that we have indeed trapped a catalytically relevant intermediate form of this RNA enzyme.

1703005|a|A previously well-characterized hammerhead catalytic RNA consisting of a 24-nucleotide substrate and a 19-nucleotide ribozyme was used to perform an extensive mutagenesis study. The cleavage rates of 21 different substrate mutations and 24 different ribozyme mutations were determined. Only one of the three phylogenetically conserved base pairs but all nine of the conserved single-stranded residues in the central core are needed for self cleavage. In most cases the mutations did not alter the ability of the hammerhead to assemble into a bimolecular complex. In the few cases where mutant hammerheads did not assemble, it appeared to be the result of the mutation stabilizing an alternate substrate or ribozyme secondary structure. All combinations of mutant substrate and mutant ribozyme were less active than the corresponding single mutations, suggesting that the hammerhead contains few, if any, replaceable tertiary interactions as are found in tRNA. The refined consensus hammerhead resulting from this work was used to identify potential hammerheads present in a variety of Escherichia coli gene sequences.

Stems with 2 bp rather than the conventional 4 bp show essentially unaltered catalytic activity, independent of the composition of the tetraloop. Further reduction in size to 1 bp or 0 bp decreases activity drastically. Inversion of the G10.1.C11.1 bp next to the invariant core leads to a loss in activity, even when the stem consists of 4 bp. Thus, the minimal structural requirement for stem-loop II is a 2-bp stem with a conserved G.C bp. The reduction in catalytic activity is predominantly a result of a decrease of catalytic constant kcat, whereas Km is only slightly affected. Thus, the structural requirement for optimal activity in these constructs where the chemical-cleavage step is rate limiting is determined by the stabilization of the transition state.

9341112|a|Previous crystallographic and biochemical studies of the hammerhead ribozyme suggest that a metal ion is ligated by the pro-Rp oxygen of phosphate 9 and by N7 of G10.1 and has a functional role in the cleavage reaction. We have tested this model by examining the cleavage properties of a hammerhead containing a unique phosphorothioate at position 9. The Rp-, but not Sp-, phosphorothioate reduces the cleavage rate by 10(3)-fold, and the rate can be fully restored by addition of low concentrations of Cd2+, a thiophilic metal ion. These results strongly suggest that this bound metal ion is critical for catalysis, despite its location approximately 20 A from the cleavage site in the crystal structure. Analysis of the concentration dependence suggests that Cd2+ binds with a Kd of 25 microM in the ground state and a Kd of 2.5 nM in the transition state. The much stronger transition state binding suggests that the P9 metal ion adopts at least one additional ligand in the transition state and that this metal ion may participate in a large scale conformational change that precedes hammerhead cleavage.

7698337|a|To characterize the reaction catalyzed by a hammerhead ribozyme, the dependence on temperature of the reaction was examined. An Arrhenius plot revealed a transition that indicated a temperature-dependent change in the activation energy at around 25 degrees C. Thermodynamic parameters of the reaction were estimated at 10 and 35 degrees C. The analyses led to the following conclusions. At 25-50 degrees C, the chemical cleavage step (kcleav) was the rate-determining step, and the cleaved fragments dissociated from the ribozyme at a higher rate than the rate of the chemical reaction. When the temperature was below 25 degrees C, the cleaved fragments adhered to the ribozyme more tightly and the product dissociation step became the rate-determining step. Above 50 degrees C, the rate of the reaction decreased because, at such high temperatures, the formation of the Michaelis-Menten complex (duplex formation) was hampered by thermal melting. A conformational change in the ribozyme-substrate complex was not the rate-determining step at any of the temperatures examined.

In solution, R32 (without its substrate) consisted of a GAAA loop, stem II, a non-Watson-Crick 3-base pair duplex and a 4-base pair duplex that included a wobble G:U base pair. When an uncleavable substrate RNA (RdC11) was added to R32 without Mg2+ ions, a complex did not form between R32 and RdC11 because the substrate recognition regions of R32 formed intramolecular base pairs (the recognition arms were closed). By contrast, in the presence of Mg2+ ions, the R32-RdC11 complex was formed. Moreover, titration of mixtures of R32 and RdC11 with Mg2+ ions also induced the ribozyme-substrate interaction. Elevated concentrations (1.0 M) of monovalent Na+ ions could not induce the formation of the R32-RdC11 complex. These data suggest that Mg2+ ions are not only important as the true catalysts in the function of ribozyme-type metalloenzymes, but they also induce the structural change in the R32 hammerhead ribozyme that is necessary for establishment of the active form of the ribozyme-substrate complex.

11671711|a|The hydrolytic reactions of the monothioate analogs of 5'-O-methyluridine 2'- and 3'-dimethylphosphates have been followed over a wide acidity range, H(0) = -1.7 ([HCl] = 5 mol L(-)(1)) to pH 9. Two reactions were found to compete: mutual interconversion of the 2'- and 3'-isomers and phosphoester hydrolysis to a mixture of phosphorothioate diesters, viz., the R(P) and S(P) diastereomers of 2',3'-cyclic thiophosphate and 2'/3'-monomethylthiophosphates (i.e., three pairs of diastereomers). No marked desulfurization could be observed. The interconversion and hydrolysis both show first-order dependence of rate on acidity at pH < 0, the isomerization being 3-4 times as fast as the phosphoester hydrolysis. Under less acidic conditions, the hydrolysis remains pH-independent up to pH 7, while the isomerization becomes hydroxide-ion-catalyzed (first-order in [OH(-)]) already at pH 2. The hydrolysis is susceptible to general base catalysis in carboxylic acid buffers, the Brönsted beta value being 0.8. In contrast, no conclusive evidence for buffer-catalyzed isomerization could be obtained. All these reactions are suggested to proceed via a pentacoordinated thiophosphorane intermediate, obtained at pH < 1 by an attack of the neighboring hydroxy function on a protonated (monocationic) thiophosphate group and at pH > 2 by an attack of a deprotonated hydroxy function (oxyanion) on a neutral thiophosphate. The monocationic intermediate (pH < 1) may collapse to hydrolysis and isomerization products without further catalysis (departure of alcohol). The monoanionic thiophosphorane (pH > 2) also gives isomerization products without catalysis (departure of 2'/3'-oxyanion), whereas breakdown to the hydrolysis products needs either a specific or a general acid catalysis process (departure of methanol). Accordingly, the observed general-base-catalyzed hydrolysis most likely consists of consecutive specific base/general acid catalysis. The phosphorothioate triesters studied are, under very acidic conditions, more than 2 orders of magnitude more stable than their oxyphosphate counterparts, whereas the rate-retarding "thio effect" (k(P)(=)(O)/k(P)(=)(S)) is much smaller with the hydroxide ion-catalyzed reactions (ca. 4) and almost negligible with the pH-independent hydrolysis.

8341661|a|A mechanism is proposed for the RNA-catalyzed reactions involved in RNA splicing and RNase P hydrolysis of precursor tRNA. The mechanism postulates that chemical catalysis is facilitated by two divalent metal ions 3.9 A apart, as in phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed by protein enzymes, such as the 3',5'-exonuclease of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. One metal ion activates the attacking water or sugar hydroxyl, while the other coordinates and stabilizes the oxyanion leaving group. Both ions act as Lewis acids and stabilize the expected pentacovalent transition state. The symmetry of a two-metal-ion catalytic site fits well with the known reaction pathway of group I self-splicing introns and can also be reconciled with emerging data on group II self-splicing introns, the spliceosome, and RNase P. The role of the RNA is to position the two catalytic metal ions and properly orient the substrates via three specific binding sites.

9254698|a|In the presence of magnesium ions, cleavage by the hammerhead ribozyme RNA at a specific residue leads to 2'3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH extremities. In the cleavage reaction an activated ribose 2'-hydroxyl group attacks its attached 3'-phosphate. Molecular dynamics simulations of the crystal structure of the hammerhead ribozyme, obtained after flash-freezing of crystals under conditions where the ribozyme is active, provide evidence that a mu-bridging OH-ion is located between two Mg2+ions close to the cleavable phosphate. Constrained simulations show further that a flip from the C3'- endo to the C2'- endo conformation of the ribose at the cleavable phosphate brings the 2'-hydroxyl in proximity to both the attacked phosphorous atom and the mu-bridging OH-ion. Thus, the simulations lead to a detailed new insight into the mechanism of hammerhead ribozyme cleavage where a mu-hydroxo bridged magnesium cluster, located on the deep groove side, provides an OH-ion that is able to activate the 2'-hydroxyl nucleophile after a minor and localized conformational change in the RNA.

8799129|a|To study the cleavage mechanism of bacterial Nase P RNA, we have synthesized precursor tRNA substrates carrying a single Rp- or Sp-phosphorothioate modification at the RNase P cleavage site. Both the Sp- and the Rp-diastereomer reduced the rate of processing by Escherichia coli RNase P RNA at least 1000-fold under conditions where the chemical step is rate-limiting. The Rp-modification had no effect and the Sp-modification had a moderate effect on precursor tRNA ground state binding to RNase P RNA. Processing of the Rp-diastereomeric substrate was largely restored in the presence of the "thiophilic" Cd2+ as the only divalent metal ion, demonstrating direct metal ion coordination to the (pro)-Rp substituent at the cleavage site and arguing against a specific role for Mg(2+)-ions at the pro-Sp oxygen. For the Rp-diastereomeric substrate, Hill plot analysis revealed a cooperative dependence upon [Cd2+] of nH = 1.8, consistent with a two-metal ion mechanism. In the presence of the Sp-modification, neither Mn2+ nor Cd2+ was able to restore detectable cleavage at the canonical site. Instead, the ribozyme promotes cleavage at the neighboring unmodified phosphodiester with low efficiency. Dramatic inhibition of the chemical step by both the Rp- and Sp-phosphorothioate modification is unprecedented among known ribozymes and points to unique features of transition state geometry in the RNase P RNA-catalyzed reaction.

10390342|a|Precursor tRNA (ptRNA) substrates carrying a single Rp or Sp-phosphorothioate modification at the RNase P cleavage site were used as tools to study the cleavage mechanism of RNase P RNA from Bacillus subtilis. Both the Sp and the Rp-diastereomer reduced the rate of processing at least 10(4)-fold under conditions where the chemical step is essentially rate-limiting. Neither the Rp nor the Sp-phosphorothioate modification affected ptRNA ground state binding to B. subtilis RNase P RNA. Processing of the Rp-diastereomeric ptRNA could be restored in the presence of Mn2+or Cd2+, demonstrating direct metal ion coordination to the pro -Rp oxygen during catalysis. With Cd2+, processing required the presence of another metal ion, such as Ca2+or Mg2+, to mediate substrate binding. This is in contrast to Escherichia coli RNase P RNA, which promotes cleavage of Rp-diastereomeric ptRNA in the presence of Cd2+as the sole divalent metal ion. Analysis of [Cd2+]-dependent processing of the Rp-diastereomeric substrate by B. subtilis RNase P RNA was consistent with the involvement of at least two metal ions in catalysis. The presence of two catalytic metal ion binding sites is also supported by the inhibition mode of Ca2+on cleavage of unmodified ptRNA. In the presence of an Sp-phosphorothioate modification at the scissile bond, neither Mn2+nor Cd2+were able to restore significant cleavage at this location. Instead, the ribozyme promotes cleavage at the neighboring unmodified phosphodiester with low efficiency. Unaffected ground state binding of the Sp-diastereomeric ptRNA but a >/=10(4)-fold reduced hydrolysis rate may indicate a crucial role of the pro -Sp oxygen in transition state stabilization or may be attributed to steric exclusion of catalytic metal ions. Based on our comparative analyses of B. subtilis and E. coli RNase P RNA, each representing the main structural subtypes of bacterial RNase P RNA, common features in terms of active site constraints and role of catalytic metal ions can now be formulated for bacterial RNase P RNAs. On the other hand, substantial and unexpected differences with respect to the overall metal ion requirements and tRNA binding modes have been observed for the two catalytic RNAs.

9514742|a|A two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism has previously been proposed for several phosphoryl-transfer enzymes. In order to extend the structural basis of this mechanism, crystal structures of three single-stranded DNA substrates bound to the 3'-5' exonucleolytic active site of the large fragment of DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli have been elucidated. The first is a 2.1 A resolution structure of a Michaelis complex between the large fragment (or Klenow fragment, KF) and a single-stranded DNA substrate, stabilized by low pH and flash-freezing. The positions and identities of the catalytic metal ions, a Zn2+ at site A and a Mg2+ at site B, have been clearly established. The structural and kinetic consequences of sulfur substitutions in the scissile phosphate have been explored. A complex with the Rp isomer of phosphorothioate DNA, refined at 2.2 A resolution, shows Zn2+ bound to both metal sites and a mispositioning of the substrate and attacking nucleophile. The complex with the Sp phosphorothioate at 2. 3 A resolution reveals that metal ions do not bind in the active site, having been displaced by a bulky sulfur atom. Steady-state kinetic experiments show that catalyzed hydrolysis of the Rp isomer was reduced only about 15-fold, while no enzyme activity could be detected with the Sp phosphorothioate, consistent with the structural observations. Furthermore, Mn2+ could not rescue the activity of the exonuclease on the Sp phosphorothioate. Taken together, these studies confirm and extend the proposed two-metal-ion exonuclease mechanism and provide a structural context to explain the effects of sulfur substitutions on this and other phosphoryl-transfer enzymes. These experiments also suggest that the possibility of metal-ion exclusion be taken into account when interpreting the results of Mn2+ rescue experiments.

9042941|a|Phosphorothioate interference analysis is suited for the rapid identification of structurally and functionally important phosphate groups. Previous interference studies, however, have been limited to the analysis of pro-Rp phosphate oxygens. We employed solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and modification interference analysis to investigate either of the nonbridging phosphate oxygens within the hammerhead ribozyme. Two novel sites of Sp phosphorothioate interference were identified at positions A6 and U16.1. The results from interference experiments were confirmed by single phosphorothioate substitutions at sites of interest. Metal rescue experiments revealed that direct metal ion coordination occurs in the functional ribozyme only at the site of cleavage and at the pro-Rp oxygen of position Ag. The new approach may be generally useful in rapidly evaluating the functional importance of phosphate groups in nucleic acids.

8611518|a|An oligonucleotide substrate containing a 5'-bridging phosphorothioate linkage adjacent to a ribonucleotide has been used to investigate the cleavage mechanisms of the hammerhead ribozyme and to probe the catalytic role of the metal cofactor(s). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that a second metal interacts with the 5'-leaving group to facilitate the cleavage event. To this end, we have examined the ribozyme-mediated cleavage activity of the phosphorothioate substrate at pH 7.5 with a series of divalent metal in both the presence and absence of the polycation spermine. The cleavage products are found to be the same as for the native sequence under a variety of reaction conditions. The influence of divalent metal ion concentration, temperature, and pH on the cleavage rate also has been examined for both the oxo linkage and the thio analogue. Spermine (but not spermidine or NaCl) is shown to support efficient cleavage of the thio analogue in the absence [5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)] of a divalent metal cofactor. The cleavage of the oxo linkage exhibits a solvent deuterium isotope effect of 3.6, but a similar effect is not observed with the thio analogue. The pseudo-first-order rate constants for cleavage of the thio analogue in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ or Mn2+ at pH 7.5 are 65 and 82 x 10(-3) min-1, respectively. The native oxo linkage is cleaved at essentially the same rate as the thio analogue (35 and 97 x 10(-3) min-1 for Mg2+ and Mn2+, respectively). The absence of an appreciable thio effect and the lack of a preference for either Mg2+ or Mn2+ provides compelling evidence that the metal cofactor does not interact with the 5'-thioanion (or oxyanion) leaving group in the transition state. These rate comparisons additionally reveal the the departure of the 5'-leaving group is not the rate-limiting step of the cleavage reaction catalyzed by the hammerhead ribozyme.

In addition to the chemical cleavage, we have examined the hammerhead ribozyme mediated cleavage of the 5'-bridging phosphorothioate linkage specifically to test the hypothesis that the ribozyme employs a second metal cofactor, which functions as a Lewis acid, to catalyze transesterification. The results of our kinetics experiments do not support this double-metal model.

1400497|a|We report here the cDNA cloning and characterization of a rat basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) factor, designated HES-5. This factor has a distant sequence homology to Drosophila hairy and Enhancer-of-split proteins, both of which are required for normal neurogenesis. DNase I footprinting analyses show that HES-5 binds to the sequence CACNAG (called N box), a recognition sequence of Enhancer-of-split proteins. Although HES-5 does not bind to the sequence CANNTG (called E box) recognized by other HLH factors, it attenuates the binding of E47, an HLH activator, to E box by forming a hetero-oligomer. In cotransfection analyses using NIH 3T3 cells, HES-5 significantly represses transcription originating from the promoter containing the N box sequences. Furthermore, HES-5 also partially inhibits the E47-induced expression from the promoter containing E boxes. Northern blot, RNase protection, and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrate that the HES-5 mRNA is specifically expressed in the nervous system. Prominent expression is observed in the ventricular zones of the embryonal brain vesicles and the outer nuclear layer of the neural retina. These results suggest that the negative regulator HES-5 may play an important role in neural development.

9271433|a|Runt domain proteins are transcriptional regulators that specify cell fates for processes extending from pattern formation in insects to leukemogenesis in humans. Runt domain family members are defined based on the presence of the 128-amino-acid Runt domain, which is necessary and sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding. We demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interaction between Runt domain proteins and the corepressor Groucho. The interaction, however, is independent of the Runt domain and can be mapped to a 5-amino-acid sequence, VWRPY, present at the C terminus of all Runt domain proteins. Drosophila melanogaster Runt and Groucho interact genetically; the in vivo repression of a subset of Runt-regulated genes is dependent on the interaction with Groucho and is sensitive to Groucho dosage. Runt's repression of one gene, engrailed, is independent of VWRPY and Groucho, thus demonstrating alternative mechanisms for repression by Runt domain proteins. Unlike other transcriptional regulatory proteins that interact with Groucho, Runt domain proteins are known to activate transcription. This suggests that the Runt domain protein-Groucho interaction may be regulated.

10851137|a|We have isolated the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene Hes6, a novel member of the family of mammalian homologues of Drosophila hairy and Enhancer of split. Hes6 is expressed by both undifferentiated and differentiated cells, unlike Hes1, which is expressed only by the former cells. Hes6 alone does not bind to the DNA but suppresses Hes1 from repressing transcription. In addition, Hes6 suppresses Hes1 from inhibiting Mash1-E47 heterodimer and thereby enables Mash1 and E47 to upregulate transcription in the presence of Hes1. Furthermore, misexpression of Hes6 with retrovirus in the developing retina promotes rod photoreceptor differentiation, like Mash1, in sharp contrast to Hes1, which inhibits cell differentiation. These results suggest that Hes6 is an inhibitor of Hes1, supports Mash1 activity and promotes cell differentiation. Mutation analysis revealed that Hes1- and Hes6-specific functions are, at least in part, interchangeable by alteration of the loop region, suggesting that the loop is not simply a nonfunctional spacer but plays an important role in the specific functions.

9811573|a|Neuronal differentiation in the vertebrate nervous system is temporally and spatially controlled by mechanisms which are largely unknown. Here we investigate the role of XBF-1, an anterior neural plate-specific winged helix transcription factor, in controlling the pattern of neurogenesis in Xenopus ectoderm. We show that, in the anterior neural plate of normal embryos, prospective neurogenesis is positioned at the anterior boundary of the XBF-1 expression domain. By misexpressing XBF-1 in the posterior neural plate we show that a high dose of XBF-1 has a dual effect; it suppresses endogenous neuronal differentiation in high expressing cells and induces ectopic neuronal differentiation in adjacent cells. In contrast, a low dose of XBF-1 does not suppress but instead, expands the domain of neuronal differentiation in the lateral and ventral sides of the embryo. XBF-1 regulates the expression of XSox3, X-ngnr-1, X-Myt-1 and X-&Dgr;-1 suggesting that it acts early in the cascade leading to neuronal differentiation. A fusion of XBF-1 to a strong repressor domain (EnR) mimics most of the XBF-1 effects suggesting that the wild type XBF-1 is a transcriptional repressor. However, fusion of XBF-1 to a strong activation domain (E1A) specifically suppresses neuronal differentiation suggesting that XBF-1 may also work as a transcriptional activator. Based on these findings, we propose that XBF-1 is involved in positioning neuronal differentiation by virtue of its concentration dependent, dual activity, as a suppressor and an activator of neurogenesis.

10913198|a|HES-1 is a Hairy-related basic helix-loop-helix protein with three evolutionarily conserved regions known to define its function as a transcription repressor. The basic region, helix-loop-helix domain, and WRPW motif have been characterized for their molecular function in DNA binding, dimer formation, and corepressor recruitment, respectively. In contrast, the function conferred by a fourth conserved region, the helix 3-helix 4 (H-3/4) domain, is not known. To better understand H-3/4 domain function, we expressed HES-1 variants under tetracycline-inducible control in PC12 cells. As expected, the induced expression of moderate levels of wild-type HES-1 in PC12 cells strongly inhibited nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. This repression was dependent on the H-3/4 domain. Unexpectedly, expression of HES-1 also arrested cell growth, an effect that could be reversed upon down regulation of HES-1. Concomitant with growth arrest, there was a strong reduction in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and PCNA protein levels, although not in cyclin D1 expression. Expression of a HES-1 protein carrying the H-3/4 domain, but not the WRPW domain, still partially inhibited both proliferation and differentiation. Transcription assays in PC12 cells directly demonstrated that the H-3/4 domain can mediate DNA-binding-dependent transcription repression, even in the absence of corepressor recruitment by the WRPW motif. HES-1 expression strongly repressed transcription of the p21(cip1) promoter, a cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor up regulated during NGF-induced differentiation, and the H-3/4 domain is necessary for this repression. Thus, the H-3/4 domain of HES-1 contributes to transcription repression independently of WRPW function, inhibits neurite formation, and facilitates two distinct and previously uncharacterized roles for HES-1: the inhibition of cell proliferation and the direct transcriptional repression of the NGF-induced gene, p21.

9144241|a|The achaete-scute genes encode essential transcription factors in normal Drosophila and vertebrate nervous system development. Human achaete-scute homolog-1 (hASH1) is constitutively expressed in a human lung cancer with neuroendocrine (NE) features, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and is essential for development of the normal pulmonary NE cells that most resemble this neoplasm. Mechanisms regulating achaete-scute homolog expression outside of Drosophila are presently unclear, either in the context of the developing nervous system or in normal or neoplastic cells with NE features. We now provide evidence that the protein hairy-enhancer-of-split-1 (HES-1) acts in a similar manner as its Drosophila homolog, hairy, to transcriptionally repress achaete-scute expression. HES-1 protein is detected at abundant levels in most non-NE human lung cancer cell lines which lack hASH1 but is virtually absent in hASH1-expressing lung cancer cells. Moreover, induction of HES-1 in a SCLC cell line down-regulates endogenous hASH1 gene expression. The repressive effect of HES-1 is directly mediated by binding of the protein to a class C site in the hASH1 promoter. Thus, a key part of the process that determines neural fate in Drosophila is conserved in human lung cancer cells. Furthermore, modulation of this pathway may underlie the constitutive hASH1 expression seen in NE tumors such as SCLC, the most virulent human lung cancer.

10485845|a|The Drosophila gene groucho (gro) encodes a transcriptional corepressor that has critical roles in many development processes. In an effort to illuminate the mechanism of Gro-mediated repression, we have employed Gro as an affinity reagent to purify Gro-binding proteins from embryonic nuclear extracts. One of these proteins was found to be the histone deacetylase Rpd3. Protein-protein interaction assays suggest that Gro and Rpd3 form a complex in vivo and that they interact directly via the glycine/proline rich (GP) domain in Gro. Cell culture assays demonstrate that Rpd3 potentiates repression by the GP domain. Furthermore, experiments employing a histone deacetylase inhibitor, as well as a catalytically inactive form of Rpd3, imply that histone deacetylase activity is required for efficient Gro-mediated repression. Finally, mutations in gro and rpd3 have synergistic effects on embryonic lethality and pattern formation. These findings support the view that Gro mediates repression, at least in part, by the direct recruitment of the histone deacetylase Rpd3 to the template, where it can modulate local chromatin structure.

10559189|a|Transcriptional repression by sequence-specific DNA binding factors is mediated by the recruitment of a corepressor complex to the promoter region. The NK-3 homeodomain protein is a transcriptional repressor that recruits the nuclear protein kinase, homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2). Here we show that HIPK2 is a component of a corepressor complex containing Groucho and a histone deacetylase complex. Groucho, like HIPK2, acts as a corepressor for NK-3 and binds to NK-3 and HIPK2. Moreover, HIPK2 appears to regulate the corepressor activity of Groucho. Transcriptional repression by NK-3 and Groucho is relieved by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, and both NK-3 and Groucho directly interact with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 that is associated with mSin3A in vivo. Recruitment of the histone deacetylase complex by NK-3 decreases the acetylated histones that are associated with the target gene promoter. These results indicate that NK-3 represses transcription by recruiting a complex containing Groucho and a histone deacetylase complex that leads to histone modification on chromatin and suggest that HIPK2 may play a regulatory role in the corepressor complex formation.

Notch signaling controls the differentiation of a variety of tissues in invertebrates and vertebrates. We are investigating the role of the TLE genes during mammalian development. We show that TLE 1 and TLE 3 are expressed during a number of cell-determination events, including embryonic segmentation, central and peripheral neurogenesis, and epithelial differentiation. This expression pattern is in agreement with the involvement of Groucho in similar fate choices in Drosophila and suggests that Groucho and TLE proteins perform similar developmental roles. Our results also show that TLE genes are co-expressed during a variety of cell-fate choices with several vertebrate homologues of genes implicated in the Drosophila Notch cascade, suggesting a role for the TLE proteins in mammalian Notch signaling.

1752423|a|Molecular correlation of the genetic aspects of the function of the neurogenic gene Enhancer of split [E(spl)] has previously been hampered by the densely transcribed nature of the chromosomal region within which it resides. We present data indicating that two distinct molecular species contribute to E(spl) function. Analysis of new E(spl) alleles has allowed us to define two complementing functions within the locus. Subsequent phenotypic analysis of different E(spl) deficiencies combined with P element-transformed constructs has demonstrated that these two functions correspond to: (1) a family of helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein-encoding genes and (2) the single copy gene E(spl) m9/10, whose product shares homology with G-protein beta subunits. The zygotically active E(spl) HLH genes can, at least partially, substitute for one another's functions and their total copy number determines the activity of the locus. E(spl) m9/10 acts synergistically with the E(spl) HLH genes and other neurogenic genes in the process of neurogenesis. The maternal component of E(spl) m9/10 has the most pronounced effect in neurogenesis, while its zygotic component is predominantly required during postembryonic development. The lethality of trans-heterozygotes of null E(spl) deficiency alleles with a strong Delta point mutation is a result of the concomitant reduction in activity of both E(spl) HLH and m9/10 functions. Immunocytochemical localization of the E(spl) m9/10 protein has revealed that it is a ubiquitously distributed nuclear component in embryonic, larval and imaginal tissues.

10498272|a|Brain factor-1 (BF-1) is a winged-helix (WH) transcription factor with a restricted pattern of expression in the neural tube. In the embryo, BF-1 is localized to the progenitor cells of the most rostral neural tube, the telencephalic neuroepithelium. Expression of BF-1 persists in the adult brain in the structures derived from the telencephalon, including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the olfactory bulbs and the basal ganglia. Targeted disruption of the BF-1 gene in mice results in hypoplasia of the cerebral hemispheres. Proliferation of the telencephalic neuroepithelium is decreased and neuronal differentiation occurs prematurely. The forebrain of the BF-1 (-/-) mutant also displays dorsal-ventral patterning defects. Development of the ventral (basal) region of the telencephalon is more severely affected than the dorsal region. These anomalies are associated with the ectopic expression of BMP4 in the dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium and the loss of shh in the ventral telencephalon. These results raise the possibility that BF-1 may modulate both progenitor cell proliferation and regional patterning by regulating the expression or activity of inductive signals which act on the telencephalic neuroepithelium.

8649374|a|Hairy-related proteins include the Drosophila Hairy and Enhancer of Split proteins and mammalian Hes proteins. These proteins are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional repressors that control cell fate decisions such as neurogenesis or myogenesis in both Drosophila melanogaster and mammals. Hairy-related proteins are site-specific DNA-binding proteins defined by the presence of both a repressor-specific bHLH DNA binding domain and a carboxyl-terminal WRPW (Trp-Arg-Pro-Trp) motif. These proteins act as repressors by binding to DNA sites in target gene promoters and not by interfering with activator proteins, indicating that these proteins are active repressors which should therefore have specific repression domains. Here we show the WRPW motif to be a functional transcriptional repression domain sufficient to confer active repression to Hairy-related proteins or a heterologous DNA-binding protein, Ga14. This motif was previously shown to be necessary for interactions with Groucho, a genetically defined corepressor for Drosophila Hairy-related proteins. Here we show that the WRPW motif is sufficient to recruit Groucho or the TLE mammalian homologs to target gene promoters. We also show that Groucho and TLE proteins actively repress transcription when directly bound to a target gene promoter and identify a novel, highly conserved transcriptional repression domain in these proteins. These results directly demonstrate that Groucho family proteins are active transcriptional corepressors for Hairy-related proteins and are recruited by the 4-amino acid protein-protein interaction domain, WRPW.

9539123|a|neurogenin2 encodes a neural-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor related to the Drosophila proneural factor atonal. We show here that the murine ngn2 gene is essential for development of the epibranchial placode-derived cranial sensory ganglia. An ngn2 null mutation blocks the delamination of neuronal precursors from the placodes, the first morphological sign of differentiation in these lineages. Mutant placodal cells fail to express downstream bHLH differentiation factors and the Notch ligand Delta-like 1. These data suggest that ngn2 functions like the Drosophila proneural genes in the determination of neuronal fate in distal cranial ganglia. Interestingly, the homeobox gene Phox2a is activated independently of ngn2 in epibranchial placodes, suggesting that neuronal fate and neuronal subtype identity may be specified independently in cranial sensory ganglia.

9187146|a|Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) play crucial roles in a variety of developmental processes, but their functions during early vertebrate brain development are largely unknown. To investigate this problem, we have compared by in situ hybridization the expression of five Bmp genes belonging to the Drosophila Decapentaplegic (Bmp2 and Bmp4) and 60A subgroups (Bmp5, Bmp6 and Bmp7). Striking co-expression of these Bmps is observed within the dorsomedial telencephalon, coincident with a future site of choroid plexus development. Bmp co-expression overlaps that of Msx1 and Hfh4, and is complementary to that of Bf1. The domain of Bmp co-expression is also associated with limited growth of the neuroectoderm, as revealed by morphological observation, reduced cell proliferation, and increased local programmed cell death. In vitro experiments using explants from the embryonic lateral telencephalic neuroectoderm reveal that exogenous BMP proteins (BMP4 and BMP2) induce expression of Msx1 and inhibit Bf1 expression, a finding consistent with their specific expression patterns in vivo. Moreover, BMP proteins locally inhibit cell proliferation and increase apoptosis in the explants. These results provide evidence that BMPs function during regional morphogenesis of the dorsal telencephalon by regulating specific gene expression, cell proliferation and local cell death.

7619533|a|To identify molecules that regulate the transition of dividing neuroblasts to terminally differentiated neurons in the CNS, conditions have been developed that allow the neuronal differentiation of cortical precursor cells to be examined in vitro. In these cultures, the proliferation of undifferentiated precursor cells is controlled by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The proliferative effects of bFGF do not preclude the action of signals that promote differentiation, since addition of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) antagonizes the proliferative effects of bFGF and enhances neuronal differentiation. In addition, blocking NT-3 function with neutralizing antibodies leads to a marked decrease in the number of differentiated neurons, without affecting the proliferation of cortical precursors or the survival of postmitotic cortical neurons. These observations suggest that bFGF and NT-3, by their distinct effects on cell proliferation and differentiation, are key regulators of neurogenesis in the CNS.

9874198|a|Groucho is a Drosophila transcriptional repressor involved in neurogenesis, segmentation, and sex determination together with basic helix-loop-helix proteins of the Hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) family. Several mammalian Groucho homologues, the Transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) 1 through 4 proteins, share similar properties with their Drosophila counterpart, suggesting that TLE proteins perform functions analogous to the roles of Groucho in Drosophila. The aim of this study was to examine this possibility by characterizing the properties of TLE2 and extending the analysis of TLE1. It is shown here that TLE2 and TLE1 are transcriptional repressors that contain two separate repression domains, located either within a Gln-rich amino terminal region or within an internal domain characterized by an abundance of Ser, Thr, and Pro residues. In addition, both TLE2 and TLE1 can homo- and heterodimerize through a short region that is part of their amino-terminal transcription repression domains. Finally, TLE2 interacts and is co-expressed with mammalian HES proteins in both neural and non-neural tissues. Taken together, these findings implicate TLE2 in transcriptional repression and define the structural elements that mediate transcriptional and protein-protein interaction functions of Groucho/TLE proteins.

TUP1 is functionally related to invertebrate and vertebrate transcriptional repressors of the Groucho/transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) family. The aim was to examine whether similar mechanisms underlie the transcription repression functions of TUP1 and Groucho/TLEs by determining whether TLE family members can interact with yeast SSN6 and mammalian SSN6-like proteins. It is shown in the present work that SSN6 binds to TLE1 and mediates transcriptional repression when expressed in mammalian cells. Moreover, TLE1 and TLE2 interact with two mammalian proteins related to SSN6, designated as the products of the ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide-repeat genes on the Y (or X) chromosomes (UTY/X). These findings suggest that mammalian TLE and UTY/X proteins may mediate repression mechanisms similar to those performed by TUP1-SSN6 in yeast.

We created a null allele of this gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for the mutation die at birth with apparent breathing and feeding defects. The brain and spinal cord of the mutants appear normal, but their olfactory epithelium and sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric ganglia are severely affected. In the olfactory epithelium, neuronal progenitors die at an early stage, whereas the nonneuronal supporting cells are present. In sympathetic ganglia, the mutation arrests the development of neuronal precursors, preventing the generation of sympathetic neurons, but does not affect glial precursor cells. These observations suggest that Mash-1, like its Drosophila homologs of the AS-C, controls a basic operation in development of neuronal progenitors in distinct neural lineages.

10683182|a|XBF-1 is an anterior neural plate-specific, winged helix transcription factor that affects neural development in a concentration-dependent manner. A high concentration of XBF-1 results in suppression of endogenous neuronal differentiation and an expansion of undifferentiated neuroectoderm. Here we investigate the mechanism by which this expansion is achieved. Our findings suggest that XBF-1 converts ectoderm to a neural fate and it does so independently of any effects on the mesoderm. In addition, we show that a high dose of XBF-1 promotes the proliferation of neuroectodermal cells while a low dose inhibits ectodermal proliferation. Thus, the neural expansion observed after high dose XBF-1 misexpression is due both to an increase in the number of ectodermal cells devoted to a neural fate and an increase in their proliferation. We show that the effect on cell proliferation is likely to be mediated by p27(XIC1), a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor. We show that p27(XIC1) is expressed in a spatially restricted pattern in the embryo, including the anterior neural plate, and when misexpressed it is sufficient to block the cell cycle in vivo. We find that p27(XIC1 )is transcriptionally regulated by XBF-1 in a dose-dependent manner such that it is suppressed or ectopically induced by a high or low dose of XBF-1, respectively. However, while a low dose of XBF-1 induces ectopic p27(XIC1 )and ectopic neurons, misexpression of p27(XIC1 )does not induce ectopic neurons, suggesting that the effects of XBF-1 on cell fate and cell proliferation are distinct. Finally, we show that p27(XIC1 )is suppressed by XBF-1 in the absence of protein synthesis, suggesting that at least one component of p27(XIC1 )regulation by XBF-1 may be direct. Thus, XBF-1 is a neural-specific transcription factor that can independently affect both the cell fate choice and the proliferative status of the cells in which it is expressed.

7815060|a|One of the earliest events in the development of the central nervous system is the establishment of positional identity along the anteroposterior (A-P) axis of the neuroepithelium. In recent years, regulatory genes with regionally restricted expression in the neuroepithelium have been identified which are believed to specify its developmental fate. We have previously described Brain Factor-1 (BF-1), a winged helix (WH) transcription factor expressed in the telencephalic neuroepithelium (Tao and Lai, 1992) Neuron 8:957-966. Here we report the cloning of the mouse cDNA for a novel WH protein, BF-2. We show that BF-2 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein with a binding specificity distinct from BF-1. Its expression in the CNS during embryogenesis is restricted to the rostral diencephalic neuroepithelium. The caudal boundary of BF-2 expression is at the zona limitans intrathalamica. Rostrally, the BF-2 expression domain is adjacent to that of BF-1. The expression domains of these two factors define a boundary within the developing forebrain neuroepithelium. The BF-1/BF-2 boundary also extends laterally to divide the optic stalk and the retina into nasal (anterior) and temporal (posterior) domains. These observations suggest that in addition to playing a role in the subdivision of the forebrain, these two WH factors may also function to establish positional information in the retinal neuroepithelium.

8565827|a|Like the neuroblasts of the central nervous system, sensory organ precursors of the peripheral nervous system of the Drosophila thorax arise as single spaced cells. However, groups of cells initially have neural potential as visualized by the expression of the proneural genes achaete and scute. A class of genes, known as the 'neurogenic genes', function to restrict the proportion of cells that differentiate as sensory organ precursors. They mediate cell communication between the competent cells by means of an inhibitory signal, Delta, that is transduced through the Notch receptor and results in a cessation of achaete-scute activity. Here we show that mutation of either the bHLH-encoding genes of the Enhancer of split complex (E(spl)-C) or groucho, like Notch or Delta mutants, cause an overproduction of sensory organ precursors at the expense of epidermis. The mutant cells behave antonomously suggesting that the corresponding gene products are required for reception of the inhibitory signal. Epistasis experiments place both E(spl)-C bHLH-encoding genes and groucho downstream of Notch and upstream of achaete and scute, consistent with the idea that they are part of the Notch signalling cascade. Since all competent cells produce both the receptor and its ligand, it was postulated that Notch and Delta are linked within each cell by a feedback loop. We show, that, like mutant Notch cells, cells mutant for E(spl)-C bHLH-encoding genes or groucho inhibit neighbouring wild-type cells causing them to adopt the epidermal fate. This inhibition requires the genes of the achaete-scute complex (AS-C) which must therefore regulate the signal Delta. Thus there is a regulatory loop between Notch and Delta that is under the transcriptional control of the E(spl)-C and AS-C genes.

10373304|a|Brain factor 1 (BF-1) is a winged-helix transcription factor with restricted expression in the anterior optic vesicle and in the telencephalic neuroepithelium of the neural tube. We have previously found that targeted disruption of the BF-1 gene results in hypoplasia of the cerebral hemispheres, which is more severe in structures derived from the ventral telencephalon. Here we show that the loss of BF-1 leads to multiple developmental anomalies of the eyes. The most ventral structure arising from the optic vesicle, the optic stalk, is missing and is replaced by an expanded retina. Ventral closure of the optic cup and choroid fissure does not occur. These dorsal-ventral patterning defects are not limited to the BF-1-expressing (anterior) cells, but also involve the cells of the posterior optic vesicle. Sonic hedgehog (shh) expression within the ventral telencephalic neuroepithelium is specifically lost in the BF-1(-/-) mutant. Taken together, these findings suggest that shh produced at this site plays a role in patterning the developing eye. This localized deficit in shh expression may also contribute to the prominence of the ventral defects in the telencephalon of the BF-1(-/-) mutant.

We are investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of Groucho and of its mammalian homologues, the TLE ('transducin-like Enhancer of split') proteins. We show that Groucho/TLE1 proteins are phosphorylated. We also show that two populations of phosphorylated Groucho proteins can be identified based on their interaction with the nuclear compartment. More slowly migrating proteins with an apparent molecular mass of roughly 110 kDa interact strongly with the nuclei, while faster migrating proteins displaying molecular masses roughly 84-85 kDa show lower affinity for the nuclear compartment. Similarly, TLE1 proteins with an apparent molecular mass of roughly 118 kDa exhibit higher affinity for the nuclear compartment than do faster migrating forms with apparent molecular masses of 90-93 kDa. Moreover, we show that the nuclear, more slowly migrating, TLE1 proteins are induced during neural determination of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. These results implicate phosphorylation in the activity of Groucho/TLE1 proteins and suggest that phosphorylated forms of higher molecular mass are involved in nuclear functions. Finally, we show that different TLE proteins respond in different ways to the neural commitment of P19 cells, suggesting that individual members of this protein family may have non-redundant functions.

7909512|a|In the developing mammalian central nervous system, neural precursor cells present in the ventricular zone determine their fate to become neurons or glial cells, migrate towards the outer layers and undergo terminal differentiation. The transcriptional repressor HES-1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor structurally related to the Drosophila hairy gene, is expressed at high levels throughout the ventricular zone, but the level decreases as neural differentiation proceeds. Because of this negative correlation, we tested whether continuous expression of HES-1 inhibits neural differentiation. A HES-1 and lacZ-transducing retrovirus (SG-HES1) and a control lacZ-transducing retrovirus (SG) were injected into the lateral ventricles of mouse embryos, and the fate of the infected neural precursor cells was examined by X-gal staining. The SG virus-infected cells migrated and differentiated into neurons and glial cells. In contrast, the cells infected with SG-HES1 virus remained in the ventricular/subventricular zone, decreased to approximately 10% in number as compared with that of the newborn during the postnatal 4-5 weeks and, when they survived, were present exclusively in the ependymal layer. Furthermore, whereas cultured neural precursor cells infected with SG virus became immunoreactive for neuronal and glial markers, the cells infected with SG-HES1 virus did not. These results show that persistent expression of HES-1 severely perturbs neuronal and glial differentiation.

We have generated monoclonal antibodies that recognise some of the basic helix-loop-helix proteins encoded by the Enhancer of split locus and have used them to examine expression of Enhancer of split proteins during neurogenesis. The proteins are expressed in a dynamic pattern in the ventral neurogenic region and are confined to those ectodermal cells that surround a neuroblast in the process of delaminating. There is no staining in the neuroblasts themselves. We have also examined the relationship between Enhancer of split protein accumulation and the Notch signalling pathway. Protein expression is abolished in a number of neurogenic mutant backgrounds, including Notch, but is increased as a result of expressing a constitutively active Notch product. We conclude that Notch signalling activity is directly responsible for the accumulation of basic helix-loop-helix proteins encoded by the Enhancer of split locus.

9367988|a|Relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in transcriptional repression, despite its importance in development and differentiation. Recent evidence suggests that some transcriptional repressors act by way of adaptor molecules known as corepressors. Here, we use in vivo functional assays to test whether different repressor activities are mediated by the Groucho (Gro) corepressor in the Drosophila embryo. Previously, Gro was proposed to mediate repression by the Hairy-related family of basic helix-loop-helix proteins. Our results indicate not only that repression by Hairy requires Gro, but that a repressor domain from the Engrailed (En) homeodomain protein is also Gro dependent. The latter result correlates with an ability of this En domain to bind to Gro in vitro. In contrast, repressor regions from the Even-skipped, Snail, Krüppel, and Knirps transcription factors are effective in the absence of Gro. These results show that Gro is not generally required for repression, but acts as a specific corepressor for a fraction of negative regulators, including Hairy and En.

9570134|a|The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor Mash1 is expressed in the developing nervous system. Null mutation of Mash1 results in loss of olfactory and autonomic neurons and delays differentiation of retinal neurons, indicating that Mash1 promotes neuronal differentiation. Other bHLH genes, Math/NeuroD/Neurogenin, all expressed in the developing nervous system, have also been suggested to promote neuronal differentiation. In contrast, another bHLH factor, HES1, which is expressed by neural precursor cells but not by neurons, represses Mash1 expression and antagonizes Mash1 activity in a dominant negative manner. Forced expression of HES1 in precursor cells blocks neuronal differentiation in the brain and retina, indicating that HES1 is a negative regulator of neuronal differentiation. Conversely, null mutation of HES1 up-regulates Mash1 expression, accelerates neuronal differentiation, and causes severe defects of the brain and eyes. Thus, HES1 regulates brain and eye morphogenesis by inhibiting premature neuronal differentiation, and the down-regulation of HES1 expression at the right time is required for normal development of the nervous system. Interestingly, HES1 can repress its own expression by binding to its promoter, suggesting that negative autoregulation may contribute to down-regulation of HES1 expression during neural development. Recent studies indicate that HES1 expression is also controlled by RBP-J, a mammalian homologue of Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)], and Notch, a key membrane protein that may regulate lateral specification through RBP-J during neural development. Thus, the Notch-->RBP-J-->HES1-Mash1 pathway may play a critical role in neuronal differentiation.

8892234|a|The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis. Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4 was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells. This distinct pattern of expression suggests a role for Grg4 in later stages of cell differentiation than for the other mouse neurogenic gene homologues.

7754368|a|Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are instrumental in determining cell type during development. A bHLH protein, termed NeuroD, for neurogenic differentiation, has now been identified as a differentiation factor for neurogenesis because (i) it is expressed transiently in a subset of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems at the time of their terminal differentiation into mature neurons and (ii) ectopic expression of neuroD in Xenopus embryos causes premature differentiation of neuronal precursors. Furthermore, neuroD can convert presumptive epidermal cells into neurons and also act as a neuronal determination gene. However, unlike another previously identified proneural gene (XASH-3), neuroD seems competent to bypass the normal inhibitory influences that usually prevent neurogenesis in ventral and lateral ectoderm and is capable of converting most of the embryonic ectoderm into neurons. The data suggest that neuroD may participate in the terminal differentiation step during vertebrate neuronal development.

9751710|a|The mammalian AML/CBFalpha runt domain (RD) transcription factors regulate hematopoiesis and osteoblast differentiation. Like their Drosophila counterparts, most mammalian RD proteins terminate in a common pentapeptide, VWRPY, which serves to recruit the corepressor Groucho (Gro). Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, in vitro association and pull-down experiments, we demonstrate that Gro and its mammalian homolog TLE1 specifically interact with AML1 and AML2. In addition to the VWRPY motif, other C-terminal sequences are required for these interactions with Gro/TLE1. TLE1 inhibits AML1-dependent transactivation of the T cell receptor (TCR) enhancers alpha and beta, which contain functional AML binding sites, in transfected Jurkat T cells. LEF-1 is an additional transcription factor that mediates transactivation of TCR enhancers. LEF-1 and its Drosophila homolog Pangolin (Pan) are involved in the Wnt/Wg signaling pathway through interactions with the coactivator beta-catenin and its highly conserved fly homolog Armadillo (Arm). We show that TLE/Gro interacts with LEF-1 and Pan, and inhibits LEF-1:beta-catenin-dependent transcription. These data indicate that, in addition to their activity as transcriptional activators, AML1 and LEF-1 can act, through recruitment of the corepressor TLE1, as transcriptional repressors in TCR regulation and Wnt/Wg signaling.

8858147|a|Several bHLH proteins are involved in vertebrate neurogenesis, but those controlling early stages of neuronal determination have not yet been identified. Here we describe a novel, NeuroD-related bHLH protein, NEUROGENIN, whose expression precedes that of NeuroD in both mouse and Xenopus. Expression of Xenopus NEUROGENIN-related-1 (X-NGNR-1) defines the three prospective territories of primary neurogenesis. Overexpression of X-NGNR-1 (or NEUROGENIN) induces ectopic neurogenesis and ectopic expression of XNeuroD mRNA. Endogenous X-ngnr-1 expression becomes restricted to subsets of cells by lateral inhibition, mediated by X-Delta-1 and X-Notch. The properties of X-NGNR-1 are thus analogous to those of the Drosophila proneural genes, suggesting that it functions as a vertebrate neuronal determination factor.

9539122|a|The NEUROGENINS (NGNs) are neural-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. Mouse embryos lacking ngn1 fail to generate the proximal subset of cranial sensory neurons. ngn1 is required for the activation of a cascade of downstream bHLH factors, including NeuroD, MATH3, and NSCL1. ngn1 is expressed by placodal ectodermal cells and acts prior to neuroblast delamination. Moreover, NGN1 positively regulates the Delta homolog DLL1 and can be negatively regulated by Notch signaling. Thus, ngn1 functions similarly to the proneural genes in Drosophila. However, the initial pattern of ngn1 expression appears to be Notch independent. Taken together with the fact that ectopic ngn1 expression can convert ectodermal cells to neurons in Xenopus (Ma et al., 1996), these data and those of Fode et al. (1998 [this issue of Neuron]) identify ngns as vertebrate neuronal determination genes, analogous to myoD and myf5 in myogenesis.

9811586|a|We have identified Xenopus Brain Factor 2 (XBF-2) as a potent neuralizing activity in an expression cloning screen. In ectodermal explants, XBF-2 converts cells from an epidermal to a neural fate. Such explants contain neurons with distinct axonal profiles and express both anterior and posterior central nervous system (CNS) markers. In striking contrast to X-ngnR-1a or X-NeuroD, ectopic expression of XBF-2 in Xenopus embryos results in an expansion of the neural plate to the ventral midline. The enlarged neural plate consists predominantly of undifferentiated neurons. XBF-2 lies downstream of the BMP antagonists noggin, cerberus, and gremlin since ectodermal explants expressing these molecules exhibit strong expression of XBF-2. While XBF-2 does not upregulate the expression of secreted neural inducers, it downregulates the transcription of BMP-4, an epidermal inducer. We show that XBF-2 acts as a transcriptional repressor and that its effects can be phenocopied with either the engrailed or hairy repressor domain fused to the XBF-2 DNA-binding domain. A fusion of the DNA-binding domain to the activator domain of VP16 blocks the effects of XBF-2 and prevents neural plate development in the embryo. This provides evidence that a transcriptional repressor can affect both regional neural development and neurogenesis in vertebrates.

10617648|a|Drosophila Runt is the founding member of a family of related transcription factors involved in the regulation of a variety of cell-differentiation events in invertebrates and vertebrates. Runt-related proteins act as both transactivators and transcriptional repressors, suggesting that context-dependent mechanisms modulate their transcriptional properties. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of the functions of the mammalian Runt-related protein, Cbfa1. Here we provide the first demonstration that Cbfa1 (as well as the related protein, Cbfa2/AML1) physically interacts with the basic helix loop helix transcription factor, HES-1, a mammalian counterpart of the Drosophila Hairy and Enhancer of split proteins. This interaction is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal domains of Cbfa1 and HES-1, but does not require their respective tetrapeptide motifs, WRPY and WRPW. Our studies also show that HES-1 can antagonize the binding of Cbfa1 to mammalian transcriptional corepressors of the Groucho family. Moreover, HES-1 can potentiate Cbfa1-mediated transactivation in transfected cells. Taken together, these findings implicate HES-1 in the transcriptional functions of Cbfa1 and suggest that the concerted activities of Groucho and HES proteins modulate the functions of mammalian Runt-related proteins.

11035023|a|Hairy/Enhancer of split 1 (Hes1) is a mammalian transcriptional repressor that plays crucial roles in the regulation of several developmental processes, including neuronal differentiation. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the transcription repression activity of Hes1. It is shown here that Hes1 associates with the nuclear matrix, the ribonucleoprotein network of the nucleus that plays important roles in transcriptional regulation. Nuclear matrix binding is mediated by the same Hes1 C-terminal domain that is also required for transcriptional repression. This domain contains the WRPW motif that acts as a binding site for the transcriptional corepressor Groucho, which also localizes to the nuclear matrix. Both the nuclear matrix association and transcription repression activity of Hes1 are inhibited by deletion of the WRPW motif, indicating that Groucho acts as a transcriptional corepressor for Hes1. This corepressor role is not modulated by the Groucho-related gene product Grg5. In contrast, the Runt-related protein RUNX2, which localizes to the nuclear matrix and interacts with Groucho and Hes1, can inhibit both the Groucho.Hes1 interaction and the transcription repression ability of Hes1. Together, these observations suggest that transcriptional repression by Hes1 requires interactions with Groucho at the nuclear matrix and that RUNX proteins act as negative regulators of the repressive activity of Groucho.Hes1 complexes.

To understand the intracellular pathway of mammalian Notch, the role of the bHLH genes Hes1 and Hes5 (mammalian hairy and Enhancer-of-split homologues) was examined by retrovirally misexpressing the constitutively active form of Notch (caNotch) in neural precursor cells prepared from wild-type, Hes1-null, Hes5-null and Hes1-Hes5 double-null mouse embryos. We found that caNotch, which induced the endogenous Hes1 and Hes5 expression, inhibited neuronal differentiation in the wild-type, Hes1-null and Hes5-null background, but not in the Hes1-Hes5 double-null background. These results demonstrate that Hes1 and Hes5 are essential Notch effectors in regulation of mammalian neuronal differentiation.

We are investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of Groucho and its mammalian homologs, the transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) proteins. We report that Groucho/TLEs are associated with chromatin in live cells and that they co-purify with isolated histones. Affinity chromatography and far Western blotting studies show further that native Groucho/TLE proteins interact specifically with histone H3 and not with other core histones. This interaction is mediated by the H3 amino-terminal domain previously shown by genetic analysis in yeast to be essential for the role of H3 in transcriptional silencing. We also demonstrate that Groucho/TLEs form oligomeric structures in vivo. These combined findings suggest that transcription complexes containing Groucho/TLEs may associate with chromatin through interactions with the amino terminus of histone H3 and that these interactions may be propagated along the chromosome due to the ability of Groucho/TLEs to participate in higher order structures.

The C-terminal WRPW motif present in all these bHLH proteins is essential for this interaction.

1340473|a|We report the molecular characterization of two novel rat helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins, designated HES-1 and HES-3, that show structural homology to the Drosophila hairy and Enhancer of split [E(spl)] proteins, both of which are required for normal neurogenesis. HES-1 mRNA, expressed in various tissues of both embryos and adults, is present at a high level in the epithelial cells, including the embryonal neuroepithelial cells, as well as in the mesoderm-derived tissues such as the embryonal muscle. In contrast, HES-3 mRNA is produced exclusively in cerebellar Purkinje cells. HES-1 represses transcription by binding to the N box, which is a recognition sequence of E(spl) proteins. Interestingly, neither HES-1 nor HES-3 alone interacts efficiently with the E box, but each protein decreases the transcription induced by E-box-binding HLH activators such as E47. Furthermore, HES-1 also inhibits the functions of MyoD and MASH1 and effectively diminishes the myogenic conversion of C3H10T1/2 cells induced by MyoD. These results suggest that HES-1 may play an important role in mammalian development by negatively acting on the two different sequences while HES-3 acts as a repressor in a specific type of neurons.

9228093|a|Hox genes encode transcription factors that are major determinants of embryonic patterning. Recently, we and others have shown that specific recognition of target sites in DNA is partly achieved through cooperative interaction with the extradenticle/pre-B-cell transformation-related gene (EXD/PBX) family of homeodomain-containing proteins. This interaction is mediated by the YPWM motif present N-terminal to the homeodomain in HOX proteins. In the present study, we use YPWM peptides to confirm the importance of this motif for mediating HOX/PBX interactions. We also used a novel monoclonal antibody directed against the YPWM to show that occlusion of this motif abrogates cooperativity with PBX. In addition, we present evidence that residues flanking the YPWM, both N-terminally and C-terminally, stabilize the HOX.PBX cooperative complex. Because these flanking residues are also conserved among paralogs, they are likely to help distinguish the specificity of HOX/PBX interactions. Our data further show that the relative importance of individual residues within and flanking the YPWM is dependent on the identity of position 6 of the cooperative binding site (TGATTNATGG). These results suggest that interactions between PBX and the YPWM motif are modified by a base pair predicted to contact the N-terminal arm of the HOX homeodomain.

9508781|a|In this report, we have examined the requirement for the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene family in neuronal determination with a focus on the developing neocortex. To determine whether pRb is required for neuronal determination in vivo, we crossed the Rb-/- mice with transgenic mice expressing beta-galactosidase from the early, panneuronal Talpha1 alpha-tubulin promoter (Talpha1:nlacZ). In E12.5 Rb-/- embryos, the Talpha1:nlacZ transgene was robustly expressed throughout the developing nervous system. However, by E14. 5, there were perturbations in Talpha1:nlacZ expression throughout the nervous system, including deficits in the forebrain and retina. To more precisely define the temporal requirement for pRb in neuronal determination, we functionally ablated the pRb family in wild-type cortical progenitor cells that undergo the transition to postmitotic neurons in vitro by expression of a mutant adenovirus E1A protein. These studies revealed that induction of Talpha1:nlacZ did not require proteins of the pRb family. However, in their absence, determined, Talpha1:nlacZ-positive cortical neurons underwent apoptosis, presumably as a consequence of "mixed signals" deriving from their inability to undergo terminal mitosis. In contrast, when the pRb family was ablated in postmitotic cortical neurons, there was no effect on neuronal survival, nor did it cause the postmitotic neurons to reenter the cell cycle. Together, these studies define a critical temporal window of requirement for the pRb family; these proteins are not required for induction of neuronal gene expression or for the maintenance of postmitotic neurons, but are essential for determined neurons to exit the cell cycle and survive.

A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two nuclear proteins that copurified with histone deacetylase activity. Both proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing, and a complementary DNA encoding the histone deacetylase catalytic subunit (HD1) was cloned from a human Jurkat T cell library. As the predicted protein is very similar to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p, these results support a role for histone deacetylase as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription.

9566899|a|Active transcriptional repression has been characterized as a function of many regulatory factors. It facilitates combinatorial regulation of gene expression by allowing repressors to be dominant over activators under certain conditions. Here, we show that the Engrailed protein uses two distinct mechanisms to repress transcription. One activity is predominant under normal transient transfection assay conditions in cultured cells. A second activity is predominant in an in vivo active repression assay. The domain mediating the in vivo activity (eh1) is highly conserved throughout several classes of homeoproteins and interacts specifically with the Groucho corepressor. While eh1 shows only weak activity in transient transfections, much stronger activity is seen in culture when an integrated target gene is used. In this assay, the relative activities of different repression domains closely parallel those seen in vivo, with eh1 showing the predominant activity. Reducing the amounts of repressor and target gene in a transient transfection assay also increases the sensitivity of the assay to the Groucho interaction domain, albeit to a lesser extent. This suggests that it utilizes rate-limiting components that are relatively low in abundance. Since Groucho itself is abundant in these cells, the results suggest that a limiting component is recruited effectively by the repressor-corepressor complex only on integrated target genes.

10748198|a|Members of the hepatic nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) family, including HNF3alpha, HNF3beta, and HNF3gamma, play important roles in embryonic development, the establishment of tissue-specific gene expression, and the regulation of gene expression in differentiated tissues. We found, using the glutathione S-transferase pull-down method, that the transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) proteins, which are the human homologs of Drosophila Groucho, directly associate with HNF3beta. Conserved region II of HNF3beta (amino acids 361-388) is responsible for the interaction with TLE1. A mammalian two-hybrid assay was used to confirm that this interaction occurs in vivo. Overexpression of TLE1 in HepG2 and HeLa cells decreases transactivation mediated through the C-terminal domain of HNF3beta, and Grg5, a naturally occurring dominant negative form of Groucho/TLE, also increases the transcriptional activity of this region of HNF3. These results lead us to suggest that TLE proteins could influence the expression of mammalian genes regulated by HNF3.

9245493|a|The Notch gene encodes a cell surface protein that regulates cell fate choices in vertebrates and invertebrates. Given the wide variety of cell types influenced by Notch, it would seem that the signal relayed through Notch activation is not an instructive one per se. Rather, Notch signaling is thought to influence the cell's ability to respond to instructive signals responsible for specific cell fates. Expression and functional studies of Notch support this idea; however, the possibility of additional functions for Notch cannot be excluded. Much of what we know about the Notch signaling pathway comes from studies with Drosophila Notch and the Caenorhabditis elegans Notch-related genes lin-12 and glp-1. With the isolation of multiple vertebrate Notch genes we are beginning to understand and define Notch signaling in vertebrates as well. A number of excellent reviews have been published summarizing the current status of Notch/LIN-12/GLP-1 signaling in Drosophila and C. elegans, as well as recent findings with the vertebrate counterparts. Here I review the structure of the various Notch proteins and their putative ligands, and discuss possible interactions between Notch, its ligands, and other cellular components that affect Notch signal transduction. A role for Notch signaling during normal development and in disease processes is discussed in an accompanying review by T. Gridley (1997, Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 9: 103-108).

7605629|a|We generated mice with a null mutation of the forebrain-restricted transcription factor BF-1 to examine its function in brain development. Heterozygous animals have an apparently normal phenotype. Homozygous null BF-1 mutants die at birth and have a dramatic reduction in the size of the cerebral hemispheres. The development of the ventral telencephalon is more severely affected than that of the dorsal telencephalon. Telencephalic neuroepithelial cells are specified in the BF-1 mutant, but their proliferation is reduced. Dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelial cells also differentiate prematurely, leading to early depletion of the progenitor population. These results suggest that BF-1 controls the morphogenesis of the telencephalon by regulating the rate of neuroepithelial cell proliferation and the timing of neuronal differentiation.

9572356|a|The Drosophila protein Groucho is involved in the regulation of cell-determination events during insect neurogenesis and segmentation. A group of mammalian proteins, referred to as transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) 1 through 4, share with Groucho identical structures and molecular properties. The aim was to determine whether individual TLE proteins participate in the regulation of cell determination in mammals like their Drosophila counterpart. It is here reported that TLE family members are expressed in combinatorial ways during the in vitro differentiation of mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells (a model for neural determination) and rat CFK2 cells (a model for chondrocytic determination). TLE1 is up-regulated and TLE2 and TLE4 are down-regulated to different extents during early stages of differentiation. In contrast, later stages correlate with up-regulation of TLE2 and TLE4, and decreased expression of TLE1. Individual TLE proteins are also expressed in combinatorial as well as complementary patterns during the development of the cerebral cortex and spinal cord of mouse embryos. In particular, TLE1 is robustly expressed in both neural progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons of the outer layers of the cortical plate, whereas TLE4 expression marks preferentially postmitotic neurons of the inner layers. Taken together, these results strongly suggest non-redundant roles for individual TLE proteins during both cell-determination and cell-differentiation events.

10781944|a|Transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) 1 is a mammalian transcriptional corepressor homologous to Drosophila Groucho. In Drosophila, Groucho acts together with bHLH proteins of the Hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) family to negatively regulate neuronal differentiation. Loss of the functions of Groucho or HES proteins results in supernumerary central and peripheral neurons. This suggests that mammalian TLE/Groucho family members may also be involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation. Consistent with this possibility, TLE1 is expressed in proliferating neural progenitor cells of the central nervous system, but its expression is transiently down-regulated in newly generated postmitotic neurons. Based on these observations, we investigated whether persistent TLE1 expression in postmitotic neurons would perturb the normal course of neuronal development. Transgenic mice were derived in which the human TLE1 gene is regulated by the promoter of the Talpha1 alpha-tubulin gene, which is exclusively expressed in postmitotic neurons. In these mice, constitutive expression of TLE1 inhibits neuronal development in the embryonic forebrain leading to increased apoptosis and neuronal loss in the ventral and dorsal telencephalon. These results provide the first direct evidence that TLE1 is an important negative regulator of postmitotic neuronal differentiation in the mammalian central nervous system.

The results suggest: (1) There exists in the motion system mechanisms selective for spatial frequency. The preferred spatial frequency varies considerably and extends down to at least 0.06 c/deg. (2) At all spatial frequencies (from 0.1 to 10 c/deg) there exist detectors selective for orientation which vary in (directed) orientation tuning to encompass 360 degrees. (3) The bandwidth of both spatial frequency and orientation selectivity vary inversely with spatial frequency: the lower the spatial frequency, the broader the bandwidth. (4) There exist two classes of temporally tuned detectors, one lowpass (sustained) and one bandpass (transient), of preferred temporal frequency of 7-13 Hz (depending on spatial frequency).

If the static grating is presented to the other eye instead sensitivity is, at best, halved. This demonstration implies that monocular and binocular visual pathways differ in their sensitivity to spatial variations of contrast. In addition it provides another example in which the monocular visual pathways are more sensitive to spatial displacements than the binocular pathways.

2017885|a|The eyes are in continuous motion. A robust system required to make spatial separation judgments should be resistant to the positional noise produced by such movements. Two parallel lines have been jittered horizontally in order to assess the impact of stimulus movement on the retina. Jitter that maintains the separation between the two lines has minimal effect on separation discrimination thresholds, regardless of whether the targets in the two eyes jitter in a positively correlated, negatively correlated or uncorrelated manner. Presenting both eyes with line pairs but only altering the separation in one eye in the second interval yields poorer performance. However, if one eye receives a change in separation while the other views a dark screen then that monocular threshold is very similar to the binocular threshold. These results are most simply explained by procedures which average the monocular separation estimates.

2773334|a|We describe a psychophysical method for assessing binocular integration using dichoptically-presented uniform fields. By temporally modulating uniform field luminances at different frequencies between the eyes, a rhythmic beat is produced--a visual percept characterized by undulations in luminance at a frequency equal to the arithmetic difference between the two monocular stimulus frequencies. Using a signal detection paradigm, we studied the beat as a function of modulation depth in normal and binocularly deficient subjects. Normal subjects easily detected the beat, even at low modulation depths, while stereoblind subjects (with stereoacuity worse than 2000 sec arc) failed to detect beats at any modulation depth or with any combination of stimulus frequencies tested. The beat provides evidence for the confluence of monocular signals into binocular integrating mechanisms. Our results therefore suggest that the status of functioning binocular mechanisms is related to the detectability of the beat. This uniform-field stimulus does not require accurate accommodation, fixation, vergence or high spatial resolution, thus making this technique particularly attractive for the study of binocular interaction in developing infants and in binocularly deficient adults.

4052502|a|Human observers dichoptically viewed displays consisting of isotropic random dots, with the dots in each eye's view all moving in a given direction or appearing stationary. When the interocular difference in direction of motion was less than 30 deg, a stable, fused percept resulted. Once this interocular difference was exceeded, binocular rivalry ensued. Rivalry was also obtained when dots seen by the two eyes moved in identical directions but at different velocities. Under this condition, the proportion of time that rivalry was experienced increased with the interocular difference in velocity. Moving dots predominated over stationary ones, and when both sets of dots moved there was no clear advantage of one speed of motion over the other. Contrary to some earlier reports, these results show that motion is not immune to binocular rivalry. Evidently the process responsible for establishing binocular correspondence between images received by the two eyes is sensitive to disparities in direction and velocity of motion.

7334429|a|Previous measurements of pattern and flicker thresholds in man have used the psychophysical method of adjustment and have required that the subject change criteria. Our new approach measures pattern and flicker thresholds by a criterion-free procedure that requires that the subject distinguish a test stimulus from control stimuli that differ from the test in only one dimension, the spatial dimension in the pattern experiments and the temporal dimension in the flicker experiments. By using this technique, we find that the subject's pattern sensitivity is equal to or greater than his flicker sensitivity for all flickering gratings except those that have extremely low spatial and moderate or high temporal frequencies (depending on the subjects). Furthermore, spatiotemporal interaction is evident in both the pattern and the flicker data. These results differ substantially from those obtained by the method of adjustment.

9747494|a|Several experiments were conducted to investigate the role of speed in global-motion processing; the extraction of the direction of motion of a small subset of coherently-moving (signal) dots in a stimulus in which the other (noise) dots move in random directions. The specific aim of the experiments was to determine whether multiple speed-tuned global-motion systems exist. The results of these experiments are: (1) when the signal dots were chosen from a group of dots moving at 1.2 degrees s-1, the speed of additional-noise dots had to be below 4.8 degrees s-1 for them to affect global-motion extraction; (2) the addition of static dots did not impair the extraction of a global-motion signal carried by dots moving at 1.2 degrees s-1; (3) noise dots moving at 1.2 degrees s-1 impaired the extraction of a global-motion signal from dots moving at 10.8 degrees s-1, though not to the same extent as dots moving at a higher speed; and (4) these results were dependent upon speed, not spatial-step size or luminance contrast. These results are interpreted as indicating that global-motion extraction occurs within at least two independent speed tuned systems. One of these systems is sensitive to high speeds and the other to low speeds.

8873357|a|In recent years the idea of parallel and independent processing streams for different visual attributes has become a guiding principle for linking the organization, architecture and function of the visual system. Findings concerning the segregation of motion and color information have been at the forefront of the evidence in favor of the parallel processing scheme. A number of studies have shown that motion perception is impaired for isoluminant stimuli, which are thought to isolate the color system. However, there are now many studies, the results of which are incompatible with the simple idea of segregated pathways. We propose two processing streams for motion that differ mostly in their temporal characteristics. Although neither of the two motion streams is color-blind, as was originally suggested, they differ radically in the way they process color information. The view that we propose provides a framework that reconciles a number of seemingly contradictory results. Evidence to support the new framework comes from psychophysical, physiological and lesion studies.

8934521|a|The motion after-effect occurs after prolonged viewing of motion; a subsequent stationary scene is perceived as moving in the opposite direction. This illusion is thought to arise because motion is represented by the differential activities of populations of cortical neurons tuned to opposite directions; fatigue in one population leads to an imbalance that favours the opposite direction once the stimulus ceases. Following adaptation to multiple directions of motion, the after-effect is unidirectional, indicating that motion signals are integrated across all directions. Yet humans can perceive several directions of motion simultaneously. The question therefore arises as to how the visual system can perform both sharp segregation and global integration of motion signals. Here we show in computer simulations that this can occur if excitatory interactions between different directions are sharply tuned while inhibitory interactions are broadly tuned. Our model predicts that adaptation to simultaneous motion in opposite directions will lead to an orthogonal motion after-effect. This prediction was confirmed in psychophysical experiments. Thus, broadly tuned inhibitory interactions are likely to be important in the integration and segregation of motion signals. These interactions may occur in the cortical area MT, which contains motion-sensitive neurons with properties similar to those required by our model.

1409598|a|Prolonged adaptation to motion in a given direction produces distinctly different visual motion aftereffects (MAEs) when viewing static vs. dynamic test displays. The dynamic MAE can be exactly simulated by real motion, whereas the static MAE cannot. In addition, the magnitude of the dynamic MAE depends on the bandwidth of motion directions experienced during adaptation, whereas the static MAE does not. Evidently a stationary pattern does not directly activate the neural mechanisms affected during motion adaptation, whereas a dynamic visual display does. These results imply that the traditional explanation of the MAE needs modification.

4733479|a|1. The sensitivity to temporally modulated sinusoidal gratings was determined. Two thresholds could be distinguished for the modulated gratings: the contrast at which flicker could be perceived and the contrast at which the spatial structure became distinct.2. The flicker detection thresholds and pattern recognition threshold varied independently as functions of the spatial and temporal frequencies, suggesting that the two thresholds represent the activity of two independent systems of channels.3. The channels detecting flicker prefer low and medium spatial frequencies. They have a pronounced decline in sensitivity at low temporal frequencies of sinusoidal modulation. They respond twice as well to gratings whose phase is alternated repetitively as to gratings turned on and off at the same rate.4. The channels responsible for the discrimination of spatial structure are most responsive at high and medium spatial frequencies. There is no decline in sensitivity at low temporal frequencies. These channels respond equally well to alternating and on/off gratings up to about 8 Hz.5. The temporal properties as revealed with sinusoidal modulation, suggest that the flicker-detecting channels would give transient responses to prolonged presentation of stimuli: the channels responsible for analysing the spatial structure would give sustained responses. The responses of the two types of channel to alternating and on/off gratings confirm this suggestion.

9854253|a|Figures that can be seen in more than one way are invaluable tools for the study of the neural basis of visual awareness, because such stimuli permit the dissociation of the neural responses that underlie what we perceive at any given time from those forming the sensory representation of a visual pattern. To study the former type of responses, monkeys were subjected to binocular rivalry, and the response of neurons in a number of different visual areas was studied while the animals reported their alternating percepts by pulling levers. Perception-related modulations of neural activity were found to occur to different extents in different cortical visual areas. The cells that were affected by suppression were almost exclusively binocular, and their proportion was found to increase in the higher processing stages of the visual system. The strongest correlations between neural activity and perception were observed in the visual areas of the temporal lobe. A strikingly large number of neurons in the early visual areas remained active during the perceptual suppression of the stimulus, a finding suggesting that conscious visual perception might be mediated by only a subset of the cells exhibiting stimulus selective responses. These physiological findings, together with a number of recent psychophysical studies, offer a new explanation of the phenomenon of binocular rivalry. Indeed, rivalry has long been considered to be closely linked with binocular fusion and stereopsis, and the sequences of dominance and suppression have been viewed as the result of competition between the two monocular channels. The physiological data presented here are incompatible with this interpretation. Rather than reflecting interocular competition, the rivalry is most probably between the two different central neural representations generated by the dichoptically presented stimuli. The mechanisms of rivalry are probably the same as, or very similar to, those underlying multistable perception in general, and further physiological studies might reveal much about the neural mechanisms of our perceptual organization.

10498927|a|In daily life our visual system is bombarded with motion information. We see cars driving by, flocks of birds flying in the sky, clouds passing behind trees that are dancing in the wind. Vision science has a good understanding of the first stage of visual motion processing, that is, the mechanism underlying the detection of local motions. Currently, research is focused on the processes that occur beyond the first stage. At this level, local motions have to be integrated to form objects, define the boundaries between them, construct surfaces and so on. An interesting, if complicated case is known as motion transparency: the situation in which two overlapping surfaces move transparently over each other. In that case two motions have to be assigned to the same retinal location. Several researchers have tried to solve this problem from a computational point of view, using physiological and psychophysical results as a guideline. We will discuss two models: one uses the traditional idea known as 'filter selection' and the other a relatively new approach based on Bayesian inference. Predictions from these models are compared with our own visual behaviour and that of the neural substrates that are presumed to underlie these perceptions.

The present article provides further support for a transient-sustained dichotomy of visual information processing by examining the effects of abrupt changes in visual stimulation in a variety of situations. Several experiments are reported in which stimuli are presented both with and without abrupt onsets. The results of these experiments, together with other evidence, suggest that the overall effects of abrupt changes in visual stimulation may be more extensive than has previously been suspected.

10700260|a|Dot patterns sliding transparently across one another are normally perceived as independently moving surfaces. Recordings from direction-selective neurons in area MT of the macaque suggested that this perceptual segregation did not depend on the presence of two peaks in the population activity. Rather, the visual system seemed to use overall shape of the population response to determine the number and directions of motion components. This approach explained a number of perceptual phenomena, including susceptibility of the motion system to direction metamers, motion patterns combining three or five directions incorrectly perceived by subjects as comprising only two directions. Our findings offer insights into the coding of multi-valued sensory signals and provide constraints for biologically based computational models.

8160370|a|Two moving random-pixel arrays (RPAs) were presented simultaneously in the same target field. These RPAs are perceived as two superimposed transparent moving sheets. Although two directions are perceived simultaneously during stimulus presentation, the movement aftereffect (MAE) is unidirectional. The visual system averages both motion signals in the MAE. For motion vectors of equal magnitude and perpendicular direction the MAE direction is the inverse of the sum of both vectors. In the first experiment we measured perceived direction of the MAE of transparent motion for a range of speed combinations. Results indicate that vector summation only predicts the correct MAE direction for combinations of equal speeds. It is suggested that the direction of the MAE of transparent motion is a resultant of the weighted summation of the component inducing vectors. The question then arises what determines the weighting factors. Directional sensitivity and MAE duration of the individual vectors under transparent conditions were measured and used to weigh the vectors and predict the MAE direction of transparent motion. Statistical analyses showed that MAE duration is a better basis to determine the weighting factors predicting the direction of the MAE of transparent motion than component sensitivity. The direction of the MAE of transparent motion thus seems to be determined by the amount of adaptation to the component vectors as reflected by MAE duration. The results suggest that this gain control cannot be located in the individual motion detectors and must be situated at or after some subsequent cooperation stage of the human motion analysis system.

10341935|a|A visual illusion known as the motion aftereffect is considered to be the perceptual manifestation of motion sensors that are recovering from adaptation. This aftereffect can be obtained for a specific range of adaptation speeds with its magnitude generally peaking for speeds around 3 deg s-1. The classic motion aftereffect is usually measured with a static test pattern. Here, we measured the magnitude of the motion aftereffect for a large range of velocities covering also higher speeds, using both static and dynamic test patterns. The results suggest that at least two (sub)populations of motion-sensitive neurons underlie these motion aftereffects. One population shows itself under static test conditions and is dominant for low adaptation speeds, and the other is prevalent under dynamic test conditions after adaptation to high speeds. The dynamic motion aftereffect can be perceived for adaptation speeds up to three times as fast as the static motion aftereffect. We tested predictions that follow from the hypothesised division in neuronal substrates. We found that for exactly the same adaptation conditions (oppositely directed transparent motion with different speeds), the aftereffect direction differs by 180 degrees depending on the test pattern. The motion aftereffect is opposite to the pattern moving at low speed when the test pattern is static, and opposite to the high-speed pattern for a dynamic test pattern. The determining factor is the combination of adaptation speed and type of test pattern.

7899027|a|The visual motion aftereffect (MAE) was initially described after observation of movements in the natural environment, like those seen in rivers and waterfalls: stationary objects appeared to move briefly in the opposite direction. In the second half of the nineteenth century the MAE was displaced into the laboratory for experimental enquiry with the aid of Plateau's spiral. Such was the interest in the phenomenon that a major review of empirical and theoretical research was written in 1911. In the latter half of the present century novel stimuli (like drifting gratings, isoluminance patterns, spatial and luminance ramps, random-dot kinematograms, and first-order and second-order motions), introduced to study space and motion perception generally, have been applied to examine MAEs. Developing theories of cortical visual processing have drawn upon MAEs to provide a link between psychophysics and physiology; this has been most pronounced in the context of monocular and binocular channels in the visual system, the combination of colour and contour information, and in the cortical sites most associated with motion processing. The relatively unchanging characteristic of the study of MAEs has been the mode of measurement: duration continues to be used as an index of its strength, although measures of threshold elevation and nulling with computer-generated motions are becoming more prevalent. The MAE is a part of the armoury of motion phenomena employed to uncover the mysteries of vision. Over the last 150 years it has proved itself immensely adaptable to the shifts of fashion in visual science, and it is likely to continue in this vein.

7833302|a|A slowly rotating striped pattern provides an instantaneous display of the temporal response characteristics of the visual system. The effect seen is that of a central column of clearly resolved stripes. The distribution of contrast across the width of the band displays the temporal frequency response; the spatial phase of the resolved stripes shows the temporal phase response of the mechanisms involved; and the orientation of the band indicates the transport delay. This band consists of two distinct regions, which suggests that there are at least two independent channels involved. At low temporal frequencies, a linear channel capable of carrying colour information mediates the appearance; at higher temporal frequencies, a nonlinear, achromatic channel predominates. The chromatic response to the pattern suggests that there is some interaction between channels. Computer simulation of a sustained and a transient channel produces an output similar to that perceived, thereby reinforcing the notion that this simple device enables one to display simultaneously the properties of the sustained and transient channels.

6672740|a|Orthogonal gratings, presented dichoptically, do not fuse into a single percept. Parts of each are seen while other parts are suppressed in an unstable perception (binocular rivalry). However, it has been previously noted that, if the gratings are briefly flashed, they will appear to fuse into a plaid or checkerboard pattern. Three experiments are reported which have been designed to define more clearly the spatial and temporal parameters of this effect in the hope that this would lead to better understanding of the normal mechanisms of dominance and suppression. Stimuli appear fused if flashed for less than 150 ms. The effect is independent of substantial changes in spatial frequency and luminance. Single flashes that appear fused when presented in isolation produce rivalry if separated by intervals less than about 150 ms. Intervals greater than 150 ms produce continued abnormal fusion. Possible mechanisms are discussed.

1528703|a|Upon dichoptic viewing of dissimilar patterns, several distinct perceptual states may be experienced over time. One state is exclusive monocular dominance, wherein the view of only one eye is seen in its entirety for some period of time. Another state is characterized by a mosaic-like college consisting of portions of the view of each eye. Two other states involve simultaneous perception of both monocular images in their entirety. In one of these states, the two monocular stimuli appear to be superimposed without depth (a phenomenon we shall term 'superimposition'). In the other state, the two monocular stimuli appear to be located at different depth planes (which we shall term 'transparency'). This paper documents the stimulus conditions favoring these various perceptual states. Exclusive monocular dominance occurs most often when the two eyes view dissimilar patterns with the same spatial-frequency content, particularly when both patterns consist of low spatial frequencies. Superimposition also occurs most often when the two eyes view the same spatial frequencies, but predominantly when those spatial frequencies are high. Transparency is favored when the spatial-frequency difference between the eyes is great, particularly when the view of one eye consists of high spatial-frequency information.

9854263|a|Anatomical and physiological evidence shows that the primate visual brain consists of many distributed processing systems, acting in parallel. Psychophysical studies show that the activity in each of the parallel systems reaches its perceptual end-point at a different time, thus leading to a perceptual asynchrony in vision. This, together with clinical and human imaging evidence, suggests strongly that the processing systems are also perceptual systems and that the different processing-perceptual systems can act more or less autonomously. Moreover, activity in each can have a conscious correlate without necessarily involving activity in other visual systems. This leads us to conclude not only that visual consciousness is itself modular, reflecting the basic modular organization of the visual brain, but that the binding of cellular activity in the processing-perceptual systems is more properly thought of as a binding of the consciousnesses generated by each of them. It is this binding that gives us our integrated image of the visual world.

9254694|a|The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.

8220450|a|An alpha-fucosidase that releases fucosyl residues from oligosaccharide fragments of xyloglucan, a plant cell wall hemicellulosic polysaccharide, was purified to homogeneity from pea (Pisum sativum) epicotyls using a combination of cation exchange chromatography and isoelectric focusing. The alpha-fucosidase has a molecular mass of 20 kDa according to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The alpha-fucosidase has an isoelectric point of 5.5. The substrate specificity of the alpha-fucosidase was determined by high performance anion exchange chromatographic analysis of oligosaccharide substrates and products. The enzyme hydrolyzes the terminal alpha-1,2-fucosidic linkage of oligosaccharides and does not cleave p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-fucoside. The enzyme does not release measurable amounts of fucosyl residues from large polysaccharides. The subcellular localization of alpha-fucosidase in pea stems and leaves has been studied by immunogold cytochemistry. The alpha-fucosidase accumulates in primary cell walls and is not detectable in the middle lamella or in the cytoplasm of 8-day-old stem tissue and 14-day-old leaf tissue. alpha-Fucosidase activity was readily detected in extracts of 8-day-old stem tissue. No significant alpha-fucosidase activity or immunogold labeling of the alpha-fucosidase was detected in 2- and 4-day-old stem tissue indicating that production of alpha-fucosidase is developmentally regulated.

7559605|a|alpha-L-Fucosidase is a cell wall protein purified from pea (Pisum sativum) epicotyls. The alpha-L-fucosidase hydrolyzes terminal fucosyl residues from oligosaccharides of plant cell wall xyloglucan. alpha-L-Fucosidase may be an important factor in plant growth regulation, as it inactivates fucose-containing xyloglucan oligosaccharides that inhibit growth of pea stem segments. The amino acid sequences of the NH2-terminal region and one internal peptide were used to design redundant oligonucleotides that were utilized as primers in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with cDNA, generated from pea mRNA, as the template. A specific PCR amplification product containing 357 base pairs was isolated, cloned, and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence included the two peptides used to design the primers for PCR plus two other peptides obtained by proteinase digestion of alpha-L-fucosidase. No sequence homology to other alpha-L-fucosidases was apparent, although the NH2-terminal region is strongly homologous to Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors. cDNA and genomic copies were isolated and sequenced. In pea, the gene is present in two or three copies. Its mRNA is present in roots, leaves, and elongating shoots. The spatial pattern of expression of the alpha-L-fucosidase was determined by in situ hybridization.

8401598|a|Advances in determination of polymer structure and in preservation of structure for electron microscopy provide the best view to date of how polysaccharides and structural proteins are organized into plant cell walls. The walls that form and partition dividing cells are modified chemically and structurally from the walls expanding to provide a cell with its functional form. In grasses, the chemical structure of the wall differs from that of all other flowering plant species that have been examined. Nevertheless, both types of wall must conform to the same physical laws. Cell expansion occurs via strictly regulated reorientation of each of the wall's components that first permits the wall to stretch in specific directions and then lock into final shape. This review integrates information on the chemical structure of individual polymers with data obtained from new techniques used to probe the arrangement of the polymers within the walls of individual cells. We provide structural models of two distinct types of walls in flowering plants consistent with the physical properties of the wall and its components.

9573180|a|Two genes, xylP and xylQ, from the xylose regulon of Lactobacillus pentosus were cloned and sequenced. Together with the repressor gene of the regulon, xylR, the xylPQ genes form an operon which is inducible by xylose and which is transcribed from a promoter located 145 bp upstream of xylP. A putative xylR binding site (xylO) and a cre-like element, mediating CcpA-dependent catabolite repression, were found in the promoter region. L. pentosus mutants in which both xylP and xylQ (LPE1) or only xylQ (LPE2) was inactivated retained the ability to ferment xylose but were impaired in their ability to ferment isoprimeverose (alpha-D-xylopyranosyl-(1,6)-D-glucopyranose). Disruption of xylQ resulted specifically in the loss of a membrane-associated alpha-xylosidase activity when LPE1 or LPE2 cells were grown on xylose. In the membrane fraction of wild-type bacteria, alpha-xylosidase could catalyze the hydrolysis of isoprimeverose and p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-xylopyranoside with apparent Km and Vmax values of 0.2 mM and 446 nmol/min/mg of protein, and 1.3 mM and 54 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. The enzyme could also hydrolyze the alpha-xylosidic linkage in xyloglucan oligosaccharides, but neither methyl-alpha-D-xylopyranoside nor alpha-glucosides were substrates. Glucose repressed the synthesis of alpha-xylosidase fivefold, and 80% of this repression was released in an L. pentosus delta ccpA mutant. The alpha-xylosidase gene was also expressed in the absence of xylose when xylR was disrupted.

3126187|a|beta-D-Galactosidase activity has been detected previously in the cotyledons of germinated nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) seeds and has been linked to the hydrolysis in vivo of storage xyloglucan (amyloid) (Edwards, M., Dea, I. C. M., Bulpin, P. V., and Reid, J. S. G. (1985) Planta (Berl.) 163, 133-140). The major beta-D-galactosidase present in extracts from the cotyledons of 9-day seedlings has now been purified to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme (Mr 97,000, no subunits) comprised a range of closely related molecular species ranging in isoelectric point from pH 6.6 to 7.1. Further purification to give a single protein band on isoelectric focusing (pI = 7.1) was achieved by chromatofocusing. The pH optimum of the enzyme (mixed molecular species) was 4.0-5.0 (stable from pH 3-10), and the temperature optimum was 50 degrees C (stable to 50 degrees C). It hydrolyzed lactose and beta-D-galactopyranosides but not melibiose and alpha-D-galactopyranosides. It did not release the terminal nonreducing alpha-D-galactopyranosyl residues from seed galactomannans, but catalyzed the rapid removal of terminal nonreducing beta-D-galactopyranosyl residues from xyloglucans. On the basis of the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze xyloglucans, the kinetics of xyloglucan hydrolysis, and an experimental demonstration of a clear correlation between xyloglucan depletion and the activity in vitro of this enzyme, it is argued that the cell-wall storage xyloglucan of the nasturtium seed is its natural substrate.

24249278|a|The levels of cell-wall xyloglucan (amyloid) in nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) cotyledons were monitored during a 28-d period covering seed imbibition, germination and early seedling development. The activities of the following enzymes capable of hydrolysing the glycosidic linkages in the xyloglucan were assayed in cotyledon extracts over the same period: endo-(1→4)-β-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4), β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), α-xylosidase and β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23). The endo-β-glucanase was assayed viscometrically using xyloglucan as substrate, and the three glycosidases using appropriate p-nitrophenylglycosides. Alpha xylosidase and β-galactosidase, the enzymes which would be expected to hydrolyse the side-chains from the xyloglucan molecule, were also assyed using xyloglucan as substrate. Under our culture conditions, xyloglucan levels remained constant at 30 mg per cotyledon pair for 7 d, that is until 3 d after germination: thereafter, the amount of xyloglucan diminished to zero in a 12-d period. The most rapid period of depletion was between days 9 and 13. The mobilisation of all reserve substances from the cotyledons resulted in a weight-loss of 92 mg: xyloglucan, therefore, is an important storage substance, representing 33% by weight of the seed's substrate reserves. It is a cell-wall storage polysaccharide. Xyloglucan mobilisation was accompanied by a 17-fold increase in endo-β-glucanase activity, a 7-fold increase in β-galactosidase and an 8-fold increase in α-xylosidase activities, all determined using xyloglucan as substrate. All three activities began to increase at day 5, peaked at days 12-14 when the most rapid phase of xyloglucan breakdown was over, and had declined to zero by days 22-25. The levels of theses enzymes have been shown to be consistent with their being responsible for xyloglucan hydrolysis in vivo. Nitrophenyl-β-galactosidase activity increased up to day 3, remained constant and then increased again 2.5-fold from day 5, peaking at day 11. Nitrophenyl-β-glucosidase remained relatively constant up to day 16 and then decreased to zero by day 25. Nitrophenyl-α-xylosidase activity was not detected.

Both enzymes showed little activity against intact fucosylated XG and they were totally inactive against p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-fucoside. Auxin treatment of pea stems, which greatly increased the activity of endo-1,4-beta-glucanases that hydrolyse XG in apical growing regions, failed to result in a similar increase in XG-nonasaccharide alpha-fucosidase activity. However, germination of nasturtium seed, which resulted in a large increase in endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (XG-ase) activity in the cotyledons, was accompanied by comparable increases in XG-alpha-fucosidase activity.

The enzyme had high activity toward maltose (k(cat) = 25 s(-1)), with an optimum at pH 4.5, and catalyzed the hydrolysis by a retaining mechanism, as shown by nuclear magnetic resonance. Acarbose was a strong inhibitor (K(i) = 1.5 microM). Molecular recognition revealed that all OH-groups in the non-reducing ring and OH-3 in the reducing ring of maltose formed important hydrogen bonds to the enzyme in the transition state complex. Mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments assigned the 92-kD protein to a barley cDNA (GenBank accession no. U22450) that appears to encode an alpha-glucosidase. A corresponding sequence (HvAgl97; GenBank accession no. AF118226) was isolated from a genomic phage library using a cDNA fragment from a barley cDNA library. HvAgl97 encodes a putative 96.6-kD protein of 879 amino acids with 93.8% identity to the protein deduced from U22450. The sequence contains two active site motifs of glycoside hydrolase family 31.

Cell-suspension cultures of spinach were grown in the presence of [(3)H]arabinose and [(3)H]fucose, and the culture-filtrates were examined for oligosaccharides by gelpermeation chromatography and by paper chromatography. Sixteen [(3)H]pentose-containing oligosaccharides were found, including twelve that contained the sequence [(3)H]xylosyl-α(1→6)-glucose, which is diagnostic of xyloglucan.

Radiochemical evidence is presented that one of these oligosaccharides was labelled with both [(3)H]fucose and with [(3)H]pentose, and was identical with the major xyloglucan-derived nonasaccharide associated with anti-auxin activity. It was largely present in the form of acylated (possibly acetylated) derivatives. It accumulated extracellularly to a steady-state concentration of about 4.3·10(-7)M.

2152170|a|Dissection of the light-responsive element (LRE) located between -166 and -50 of rbcS-3A from pea has revealed critical spacing requirements between the two GT-1 binding sites for light-responsive transcription. An increase in spacing between the two sites by as little as 2 bp reduces dramatically the rbcS-3A transcript levels in vivo. Mutation of the 10 bp between the binding sites leads to slightly lower transcript levels, as do deletions of either 3 bp or 8 bp. Deletions of 5 bp or 7 bp from between the GT-1 binding sites do not affect rbcS-3A transcript levels; however, a deletion of 10 bp virtually abolishes the activity of this element. These spacing changes within the light-responsive element similarly affect transcription of a divergently oriented and truncated nopaline synthase promoter. Most spacing changes between the two GT-1 binding sites, however, do not impair the binding of GT-1 to this element in vitro. Together with previous observations, these results suggest that the nuclear factor GT-1 may interact with the binding sites in either a productive or nonproductive manner and that GT-1 binding is necessary but not sufficient for light-responsive transcription. We also discuss our results in relation to the observed spacing of similar sequence elements present within other light-responsive promoters.

8556737|a|Oligosaccharide subunits of xyloglucan were isolated from the stems and roots of etiolated pea plants and structurally characterized. The two most abundant subunits of pea xyloglucan are the well-known nonasaccharide, XXFG, and heptasaccharide, XXXG. In addition, significant amounts of oligosaccharides that have not previously been reported to be subunits of pea xyloglucan were detected, including a decasaccharide, XLFG, two octasaccharides, XLXG and XXLG, a pentasaccharide, XXG, and a trisaccharide, XG. Several novel oligosaccharide subunits, including the octasaccharide, GXFG, and the hexasaccharide, GXXG, were also found. Xyloglucan oligosaccharides generated by treatment of intact pea stem cell walls were compared to oligosaccharides generated by endoglucanase treatment of xyloglucan polysaccharides obtained by subsequent alkali extraction of the same cell walls. The results suggest that the xyloglucan in etiolated pea stems is distributed between at least two domains, one of which is distinguished by its enzyme accessibility. We further hypothesize that the chemical modification of a xyloglucan during cell-wall maturation depends on its physical environment (i.e., the domain in which it resides). For example, only the endoglucanase-released material, representing the enzyme-accessible xyloglucan domain, contains significant amounts of the two unusual oligosaccharide subunits, GXXG and GXFG, both of which have a nonreducing terminal glucosyl residue. This structure may be generated during cell-wall maturation by the sequential action of an endolytic enzyme (such as xyloglucan endotransglycosylase or endoglucanase) and an alpha-xylosidase.

1747104|a|The amino acid sequences of 301 glycosyl hydrolases and related enzymes have been compared. A total of 291 sequences corresponding to 39 EC entries could be classified into 35 families. Only ten sequences (less than 5% of the sample) could not be assigned to any family. With the sequences available for this analysis, 18 families were found to be monospecific (containing only one EC number) and 17 were found to be polyspecific (containing at least two EC numbers). Implications on the folding characteristics and mechanism of action of these enzymes and on the evolution of carbohydrate metabolism are discussed. With the steady increase in sequence and structural data, it is suggested that the enzyme classification system should perhaps be revised.

8431946|a|We isolated a recessive Arabidopsis mutant, ctr1, that constitutively exhibits seedling and adult phenotypes observed in plants treated with the plant hormone ethylene. The ctr1 adult morphology can be phenocopied by treatment of wild-type plants with exogenous ethylene and is due, at least in part, to inhibition of cell elongation. Seedlings and adult ctr1 plants show constitutive expression of ethylene-regulated genes. The epistasis of ctr1 and other ethylene response mutants has defined the position of CTR1 in the ethylene signal transduction pathway. The CTR1 gene has been cloned, and the DNA sequences of four mutant alleles were determined. The gene encodes a putative serine/threonine protein kinase that is most closely related to the Raf protein kinase family.

9371743|a|As part of the Human Genome Project, the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center has commenced systematic sequencing of human chromsome 7. To organize and supply the effort, we have undertaken the construction of sequence-ready physical maps for defined chromosomal intervals. Map construction is a serial process composed of three main activities. First, candidate STS-positive large-insert PAC and BAC clones are identified. Next, these candidate clones are subjected to fingerprint analysis. Finally, the fingerprint data are used to assemble sequence-ready maps. The fingerprinting method we have devised is key to the success of the overall approach. We present here the details of the method and show that the fingerprints are of sufficient quality to permit the construction of megabase-size contigs in defined regions of the human genome. We anticipate that the high throughput and precision characteristic of our fingerprinting method will make it of general utility.

3936844|a|Two components of alpha-D-xylosidase (alpha-D-xylosidase I and II) were detected in the culture filtrate of Aspergillus nigher grown in a medium containing Sanzyme 1000-treated Glyloid 2A. The major component (alpha-D-xylosidase I) was purified to an electrophoretically pure state. The purified enzyme showed approximately 540-fold increase in specific activity over the original culture filtrate. The purified enzyme was shown to be an oligomeric protein consisting of four subunits, each of which had a molecular weight of 123,000. The enzyme showed the highest activity at pH 2.5-3.0 and 45 degrees C, and was stable in the pH range from 3.0 to 7.0 and at the temperatures up to 60 degrees C. The isoelectric point of this enzyme was pH 5.6. The purified enzyme was highly specific for p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-xylopyranoside and isoprimeverose (6-O-alpha-D-xylopyranosyl-D-glucopyranose). The apparent Km and Vmax values of the enzyme for p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-xylopyranoside and isoprimeverose were 10.5 mM and 40.8 mumol/min/mg protein, and 2.2 mM and 30 mumol/min/mg protein, respectively. The purified enzyme could also split off the alpha-D-xylopyranosyl residue on the non-reducing terminal of the backbone of oligoxyloglucans such as alpha-D-xylopyranosyl-(1----6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl- (1----4)-[(alpha-D-xylopyranosyl-(1----6)-]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl- (1----4)-] 2-D-glucopyranose.

The quantitatively major oligosaccharide products, a nonasaccharide and a heptasaccharide derived from xyloglucan, were purified by gel permeation chromatography. The nonasaccharide was found to inhibit the 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic-acid-induced elongation of etiolated pea (Pisum sativum) stem segments. This confirms an earlier report (York et al., 1984, Plant Physiol. 75, 295-297). The inhibition of elongation by the nonasaccharide showed a maximum at around 10(-9)M with higher and lower concentrations being less effective. The heptasaccharide did not significantly inhibit elongation at 10(-7)-10(-10)M and also did not affect the inhibition caused by the nonasaccharide when co-incubated with the latter.

16667555|a|Oligosaccharides produced by the action of fungal cellulase on xyloglucans promoted the elongation of etiolated pea (Pisum sativum L.) stem segments in a straight-growth bioassay designed for the determination of auxins. The oligosaccharides were most active at about 1 micromolar. We tested the relative growth-promoting activities of four HPLC-purified oligosaccharides which shared a common glucose(4). xylose(3) (XG7) core. The substituted oligosaccharides XG8 (glucose(4). xylose(3). galactose) and XG9n (glucose(4). xylose(3). galactose(2)) were more effective than XG7 itself and XG9 (glucose(4). xylose(3). galactose. fucose). The same oligosaccharides also promoted the degradation, assayed viscometrically, of xyloglucan by an acidic cellulase from bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) leaves. The oligosaccharides were highly active at 10(-4) molar, causing up to a fourfold increase in activity, but the effect was still detectable at 1 micromolar. Those oligosaccharides (XG8 and XG9n) which best promoted growth, stimulated cellulase activity to the greatest extent. The oligosaccharides did not stimulate the action of the cellulase in an assay based on the conversion of [(3)H]xyloglucan to ethanol-soluble fragments. This suggest that the oligosaccharides enhanced the midchain hydrolysis of xyloglucan molecules (which would rapidly reduce the viscosity of the solution), at the expense of cleavage near the termini (which would yield ethanol-soluble products). We suggest that the promotion of midchain xyloglucan cleavage, by loosening the primary cell wall matrix, explains the promotion of growth by the oligosaccharides.

9952433|a|Apoplastic alpha-glucosidases occur widely in plants but their function is unknown because appropriate substrates in the apoplast have not been identified. Arabidopsis contains at least three alpha-glucosidase genes; Aglu-1 and Aglu-3 are sequenced and Aglu-2 is known from six expressed sequence tags. Antibodies raised to a portion of Aglu-1 expressed in Escherichia coli recognize two proteins of 96 and 81 kD, respectively, in vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis, broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.), and mustard (Brassica napus L.). The acidic alpha-glucosidase activity from broccoli flower buds was purified using concanavalin A and ion-exchange chromatography. Two active fractions were resolved and both contained a 96-kD immunoreactive polypeptide. The N-terminal sequence from the 96-kD broccoli alpha-glucosidase indicated that it corresponds to the Arabidopsis Aglu-2 gene and that approximately 15 kD of the predicted N terminus was cleaved. The 81-kD protein was more abundant than the 96-kD protein, but it was not active with 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside as the substrate and it did not bind to concanavalin A. In situ activity staining using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside revealed that the acidic alpha-glucosidase activity is predominantly located in the outer cortex of broccoli stems and in vascular tissue, especially in leaf traces.

10801892|a|We here report the first molecular characterization of an alpha-xylosidase (XylS) from an Archaeon. Sulfolobus solfataricus is able to grow at temperatures higher than 80 degrees C on several carbohydrates at acidic pH. The isolated xylS gene encodes a monomeric enzyme homologous to alpha-glucosidases, alpha-xylosidases, glucoamylases and sucrase-isomaltases of the glycosyl hydrolase family 31. xylS belongs to a cluster of four genes in the S. solfataricus genome, including a beta-glycosidase, an hypothetical membrane protein homologous to the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, and an open reading frame of unknown function. The alpha-xylosidase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli showing optimal activity at 90 degrees C and a half-life at this temperature of 38 h. The purified enzyme follows a retaining mechanism of substrate hydrolysis, showing high hydrolytic activity on the disaccharide isoprimeverose and catalyzing the release of xylose from xyloglucan oligosaccharides. Synergy is observed in the concerted in vitro hydrolysis of xyloglucan oligosaccharides by the alpha-xylosidase and the beta-glycosidase from S. solfataricus. The analysis of the total S. solfataricus RNA revealed that all the genes of the cluster are actively transcribed and that xylS and orf3 genes are cotranscribed.

Thus, probes generated from both ends of 500 BAC clones selected from the Arabidopsis-IGF-BAC library were hybridised to the entire library gridded on high density filters. The 1000 hybridisation reactions identified 4496 clones (41.8% of the complete library, or 50.3% if organellar, centromeric, and ribosomal DNA carrying clones are excluded) which were assembled into a minimum of 220 contigs. These results demonstrate the viability of the applied 'double-end clone-limited/sampling without replacement' hybridisation strategy for the generation of a high resolution physical map, and provide a highly useful resource for map-based gene cloning approaches and further genome analysis.

7846151|a|High-throughput automated partial sequencing of anonymous cDNA clones provides a method to survey the repertoire of expressed genes from an organism. Comparison of the coding capacity of these expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with the sequences in the public data bases results in assignment of putative function to a significant proportion of the ESTs. Thus, the more than 13,400 plant ESTs that are currently available provide a new resource that will facilitate progress in many areas of plant biology. These opportunities are illustrated by a description of the results obtained from analysis of 1500 Arabidopsis ESTs from a cDNA library prepared from equal portions of poly(A+) mRNA from etiolated seedlings, roots, leaves, and flowering inflorescences. More than 900 different sequences were represented, 32% of which showed significant nucleotide or deduced amino acid sequences similarity to previously characterized genes or proteins from a wide range of organisms.

2511203|a|An alpha-xylosidase that acts on oligosaccharide fragments of xyloglucan, a plant cell wall polysaccharide, was purified from pea (Pisum sativum) epicotyls that had been treated with an auxin analog. The enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 85,000 Da according to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 79,000 Da according to gel-permeation chromatography under nondenaturing conditions. The purified xylosidase consisted of a series of closely related, enzymatically active proteins with isoelectric points ranging from about pH 7.35 to 7.7; the xylosidases were separated by chromatofocusing. The pH optimum of the mixed xylosidase was 4.9-5.1. The substrate specificity of the xylosidase mixture was determined by purification and structural characterization of the products of treating xyloglucan-oligosaccharide substrates with the enzyme. Characterization of the substrates and products included elution volume from a gel-permeation column, glycosyl residue and glycosyl linkage composition analyses, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The enzyme specifically cleaved only one of the alpha-xylosidic linkages of xyloglucan-oligosaccharide substrates, the one attached to a 6-linked glucosyl residue, not those attached to the 4,6-linked glucosyl residues. The enzyme was unable to cleave the xylosidic linkage of p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-xylopyranoside or the alpha-xylosidic linkage to C-6 of glucose in the disaccharide isoprimeverose. The enzyme was also unable to release measurable amounts of xylose from large xyloglucan polymers.

We have previously characterized a spinach nuclear factor S1F binding to a cis-element within the rps1 promoter, which negatively regulates both the rps1 and the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoters in transient expression assays. Here, we show that the S1F binding site is related to but different from the light-responsive Box II of the pea rbcS-3A promoter, which is recognized by the nuclear factor GT-1. Transgenic plant analyses showed that the S1F site tissue-specifically represses the rps1 promoter in roots as well as in etiolated seedlings. We suggest that the GT-1-related S1F binding site is responsible, at least in part, for the transcriptional repression of rps1 in nonphotosynthetic tissues such as roots.

8420990|a|The synthesis and posttranslational modification of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase were studied in a cell-free translation system and in mammalian cells transfected with acid alpha-glucosidase cDNA constructs. The newly synthesized precursor, sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum, was demonstrated to be membrane-bound by lack of signal peptide cleavage, and to be catalytically inactive. Sugar chain modification was shown to occur in the Golgi complex and to be dependent on the rate of transport. From the trans-Golgi network different routes were found to be followed by acid alpha-glucosidase. A fraction of precursor molecules, proteolytically released from the membrane anchor, appeared to enter the secretory pathway and was recovered from the cell culture medium in a catalytically active form. A second fraction was transported to the lysosomes and was trimmed in a stepwise process at both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends. The intramolecular cleavage sites were determined. Involvement of thiol proteinases was demonstrated. Specificity for the natural substrate glycogen was gained during the maturation process. The phosphomannosyl receptor is assumed to be instrumental in the lysosomal targeting of acid alpha-glucosidase, but a phosphomannosyl receptor-independent transport of membrane-bound precursor molecules to the lysosomes, either directly or via the plasma membrane, cannot be excluded.

The subsets of HSC that give rise to short-term vs long-term multilineage reconstitution can be separated by phenotype, demonstrating that the fates of HSC are intrinsically determined.

8643473|a|Hematopoiesis gives rise to blood cells of different lineages throughout normal life. Abnormalities in this developmental program lead to blood cell diseases including leukemia. The establishment of a cell culture system for the clonal development of hematopoietic cells made it possible to discover proteins that regulate cell viability, multiplication and differentiation of different hematopoietic cell lineages, and the molecular basis of normal and abnormal blood cell development. These regulators include cytokines now called colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and interleukins (ILs). There is a network of cytokine interactions, which has positive regulators such as CSFs and ILs and negative regulators such as transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This multigene cytokine network provides flexibility depending on which part of the network is activated and allows amplification of response to a particular stimulus. Malignancy can be suppressed in certain types of leukemic cells by inducing differentiation with cytokines that regulate normal hematopoiesis or with other compounds that use alternative differentiation pathways. This created the basis for the clinical use of differentiation therapy. The suppression of malignancy by inducing differentiation can bypass genetic abnormalities that give rise to malignancy. Different CSFs and ILs suppress programmed cell death (apoptosis) and induce cell multiplication and differentiation, and these processes of development are separately regulated. The same cytokines suppress apoptosis in normal and leukemic cells, including apoptosis induced by irradiation and cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic compounds. An excess of cytokines can increase leukemic cell resistance to cytotoxic therapy. The tumor suppressor gene wild-type p53 induces apoptosis that can also be suppressed by cytokines. The oncogene mutant p53 suppresses apoptosis. Hematopoietic cytokines such as granulocyte CSF are now used clinically to correct defects in hematopoiesis, including repair of chemotherapy-associated suppression of normal hematopoiesis in cancer patients, stimulation of normal granulocyte development in patients with infantile congenital agranulocytosis, and increase of hematopoietic precursors for blood cell transplantation. Treatments that decrease the level of apoptosis-suppressing cytokines and downregulate expression of mutant p53 and other apoptosis suppressing genes in cancer cells could improve cytotoxic cancer therapy. The basic studies on hematopoiesis and leukemia have thus provided new approaches to therapy.

7612228|a|Hematopoiesis is regulated through the interaction of a variety of growth factors with specific receptors of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Although lacking catalytic domains, all the receptors couple ligand binding to the rapid induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. This is mediated through a novel family of protein tyrosine kinases termed the Janus kinases (Jaks) which associate with the receptors and are activated following ligand binding. Depending upon the cytokine/receptor system, one or more of the four known Jaks (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, Tyk2) is/are involved. The activated Jaks phosphorylate both themselves and the receptor subunits, creating docking sites for SH2-containing proteins including SHC, which couples receptor engagement to activation of the ras pathway, and HCP, a protein tyrosine phosphatase which negatively affects the response. In addition, the Jaks phosphorylate one or more of a family of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats). Phosphorylation of Stats induces their nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity. Activation of Stats is independent of activation of the ras pathway and represents a novel signaling pathway correlated with mitogenesis.

10807766|a|Chemokines are small peptides that are potent activators and chemoattractants for leukocyte subpopulations and some nonhemopoietic cells. Their actions are mediated by a family of 7-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors, the size of which has grown considerably in recent years and now includes 18 members. Chemokine receptor expression on different cell types and their binding and response to specific chemokines are highly variable. Significant advances have been made in understanding the regulation of chemokine receptor expression and the intracellular signaling mechanisms used in bringing about cell activation. Chemokine receptors have also recently been implicated in several disease states including allergy, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, and malaria. However, most fascinating has been the observation that some of these receptors are used by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in gaining entry into permissive cells. This review will discuss structural and functional aspects of chemokine receptor biology and will consider the roles these receptors play in inflammation and in infectious diseases.

7781920|a|G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that specifically recognize agonist-occupied, activated G protein-coupled receptor proteins as substrates. Phosphorylation of an activated receptor by a GRK terminates signaling by that receptor, by initiating the uncoupling of the receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins. Six distinct mammalian GRKs are known, which differ in tissue distribution and in regulatory properties. The intracellular localization of GRKs to membrane-bound receptor substrates is the most important known regulatory feature of these enzymes. Rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) requires a post-translationally added farnesyl isoprenoid to bind to light-activated rhodopsin. The beta-adrenergic receptor kinases (GRK2 and GRK3) associate with heterotrimeric G protein beta gamma-subunits, released upon receptor activation of G proteins, for membrane anchorage. The recently-described GRKs 4, 5, and 6 comprise a distinct subgroup of GRKs. These kinases utilize distinct mechanisms for membrane localization, which are just beginning to be defined. All GRKs appear to play the same general cellular role of desensitizing activated G protein-coupled receptors, but utilize distinctly individual means to the same end.

9078236|a|The large and functionally diverse group of G-protein-coupled receptors includes receptors for many different signalling molecules, including peptide and non-peptide hormones and neuro-transmitters, chemokines, prostanoids and proteinases. Their principal function is to transmit information about the extracellular environment to the interior of the cell by interacting with the heterotrimeric G-proteins, and they thereby participate in many aspects of regulation. Cellular responses to agonists of these receptors are usually rapidly attenuated. Mechanisms of signal attenuation include removal of agonists from the extracellular fluid, receptor desensitization, endocytosis and down-regulation. Agonists are removed by dilution, uptake by transporters and enzymic degradation. Receptor desensitization is mediated by receptor phosphorylation by G-protein receptor kinases and second-messenger kinases, interaction of phosphorylated receptors with arrestins and receptor uncoupling from G-proteins. Agonist-induced receptor endocytosis also contributes to desensitization by depleting the cell surface of high-affinity receptors, and recycling of internalized receptors contributes to resensitization of cellular responses. Receptor down-regulation is a form of desensitization that occurs during continuous, long-term exposure of cells to receptor agonists. Down-regulation, which may occur during the development of drug tolerance, is characterized by depletion of the cellular receptor content, and is probably mediated by alterations in the rates of receptor degradation and synthesis. These regulatory mechanisms are important, as they govern the ability of cells to respond to agonists. A greater understanding of the mechanisms that modulate signalling may lead to the development of new therapies and may help to explain the mechanism of drug tolerance.

10966476|a|GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) regulate heterotrimeric G proteins by increasing the rates at which their subunits hydrolyze bound GTP and thus return to the inactive state. G protein GAPs act allosterically on G subunits, in contrast to GAPs for the Ras-like monomeric GTP-binding proteins. Although they do not contribute directly to the chemistry of GTP hydrolysis, G protein GAPs can accelerate hydrolysis >2000-fold. G protein GAPs include both effector proteins (phospholipase C-¿, p115RhoGEF) and a growing family of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) that are found throughout the animal and fungal kingdoms. GAP activity can sharpen the termination of a signal upon removal of stimulus, attenuate a signal either as a feedback inhibitor or in response to a second input, promote regulatory association of other proteins, or redirect signaling within a G protein signaling network. GAPs are regulated by various controls of their cellular concentrations, by complex interactions with G¿ or with G¿5 through an endogenous G-like domain, and by interaction with multiple other proteins.

We have demonstrated that the RGS domains of RGS4, RGS10, and GAIP retain GTPase accelerating activity with the Gi class substrates Gialpha1, Goalpha, and Gzalpha in vitro. No regulatory activity of the RGS domains was detected for Gsalpha. Short deletions within the RGS domain of RGS4 destroyed GTPase activating protein activity and Gialpha1 substrate binding.

9108480|a|RGS proteins are GTPase activators for heterotrimeric G proteins. We report here the 2.8 A resolution crystal structure of the RGS protein RGS4 complexed with G(i alpha1)-Mg2+-GDP-AlF4 . Only the core domain of RGS4 is visible in the crystal. The core domain binds to the three switch regions of G(i alpha1), but does not contribute catalytic residues that directly interact with either GDP or AlF4-. Therefore, RGS4 appears to catalyze rapid hydrolysis of GTP primarily by stabilizing the switch regions of G(i alpha1), although the conserved Asn-128 from RGS4 could also play a catalytic role by interacting with the hydrolytic water molecule or the side chain of Gln-204. The binding site for RGS4 on G(i alpha1) is also consistent with the activity of RGS proteins as antagonists of G(alpha) effectors.

8473738|a|Using subtractive cDNA cloning, we have isolated a series of cDNA clones that are differentially expressed between B and T lymphocytes. Whereas some of the isolated cDNA are from known B cell-specific genes, many of them represent previously uncharacterized genes. One of these unknown genes was denoted as BL34. Northern blot analysis performed with the BL34 cDNA revealed a 1.6-kb mRNA transcript that was present at low levels in RNA extracted from resting B lymphocytes, but whose expression was markedly increased in RNA prepared from mitogen-activated B cells. Similarly, RNA prepared from several B cell lines treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) contained high levels of BL34 mRNA. In contrast, RNA from purified T cells treated with phytohemagglutinin and PMA had undetectable amounts of BL34 mRNA. In addition, high levels of BL34 mRNA were detected in RNA purified from PBMC of a patient with B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. Southern blot analysis of human DNA from various tissues and cells lines demonstrated that BL34 is a single-copy gene without evidence of rearrangement. Two full length BL34 cDNA were sequenced, and an open reading frame of 588 bp was identified that was predicted to encode for a 196 amino acid protein. Searches of several protein data bases failed to find any homologous proteins. To directly analyze the expression of BL34 mRNA in lymphoid tissues in situ, hybridization studies with human tonsil tissue sections were performed. BL34 mRNA was detected in a portion of the cells in the germinal center region and adjacent to the mantle region. Further characterization of the BL34 gene and its protein should lead to insights to its role in B cell function and the consequences of its over-expression in acute lymphocytic leukemia.

9174164|a|RGS1 and RGS2 are members of a new class of regulators of G-protein signaling identified by their selective mRNA expression either in phorbol ester (TPA)-stimulated human B lymphocytes (RGS1/1R20/BL34) or in blood mononuclear cells treated with the T-cell lectin concanavalin A (ConA) and cycloheximide (RGS2/G0S8). The RGS1 gene shows low basal mRNA expression in freshly purified blood mononuclear cells, which increases upon incubation for a day. In contrast, RGS2 initially shows high basal levels of mRNA expression, which subsequently decrease. Expression of both genes increases in response to ConA, with RGS2 mRNA levels increasing briskly to a maximum between 0.5 and 1 hr and decreasing to baseline by 6 hr, whereas the RGS1 mRNA increase is delayed reaching a maximum between 1 and 2 hr. RGS1 mRNA levels increase much more in response to a protein kinase C activator (TPA), than to a calcium ionophore (ionomycin), whereas the opposite is true for RGS2. We suggest that ConA elevates RGS2 on the basis of its ability to increase intracellular calcium, and that RGS2 may be involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium. The distinction between RGS1 and RGS2 is further emphasized by studies indicating that recombinant RGS2 does not bind in vitro to two members of the G(i) subfamily of G-protein alpha-subunits for which recombinant RGS1 has high affinity.

10072511|a|The newly recognized regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) attenuate heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathways. We have cloned an IL-2-induced gene from human T cells, cytokine-responsive gene 1, which encodes a member of the RGS family, RGS16. The RGS16 protein binds Gialpha and Gqalpha proteins present in T cells, and inhibits Gi- and Gq-mediated signaling pathways. By comparison, the mitogen-induced RGS2 inhibits Gq but not Gi signaling. Moreover, the two RGS genes exhibit marked differences in expression patterns. The IL-2-induced expression of the RGS16 gene in T cells is suppressed by elevated cAMP, whereas the RGS2 gene shows a reciprocal pattern of regulation by these stimuli. Because the mitogen and cytokine receptors that trigger expression of RGS2 and RGS16 in T cells do not activate heterotrimeric G proteins, these RGS proteins and the G proteins that they regulate may play a heretofore unrecognized role in T cell functional responses to Ag and cytokine activation.

9774420|a|Serpentine Galphai-linked receptors support rapid adhesion and directed migration of leukocytes and other cell types. The intracellular mechanisms mediating and regulating chemoattractant-directed adhesion and locomotion are only now beginning to be explored. RGS (for regulator of G-protein signaling) proteins are a recently described family that regulate Galphai-stimulated pathways by acting as GTPase-activating proteins. Little is known about the GTPase activity of the Galphai proteins involved in adhesion and chemotaxis, or the significance of their regulation to these responses. Using transiently transfected lymphoid cells as a model system, we show that expression of RGS1, RGS3, and RGS4 inhibits chemoattractant-induced migration. In contrast, RGS2, a regulator of Galphaq activity, had no effect on cell migration to any chemoattractant. RGS1, RGS3, and RGS4 also reduced rapid chemoattractant-triggered adhesion, although the proadhesive response appears quantitatively less sensitive to RGS action than chemotaxis. The results suggest that the duration of the Galphai signal may be a particularly important parameter in the chemotactic responses of leukocytes, and demonstrate the potential for RGS family members to regulate cellular adhesive and migratory behaviors.

10480894|a|The leukocyte response to chemoattractants is transduced by the interaction of transmembrane receptors with GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins). RGS1 is a member of a protein family constituting a newly appreciated and large group of proteins that act as deactivators of G-protein signaling pathways by accelerating the GTPase activity of G-protein alpha subunits. We demonstrate here that RGS1 is expressed in human monocytes; by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation RGS1 was localized to the plasma membrane. By using a mixture of RGS1 and plasma membranes, we were able to demonstrate GAP activity of RGS1 on receptor-activated G-proteins; RGS1 did not affect ligand-stimulated GDP-GTP exchange. We found that RGS1 desensitizes a variety of chemotactic receptors including receptors for N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, leukotriene B4, and C5a. Interaction of RGS proteins and ligand-induced G-protein signaling can be demonstrated by determining GTPase activity using purified RGS proteins and plasma membranes.

10657631|a|Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins modulate signaling through pathways that use heterotrimeric G proteins as transducing elements. RGS1 is expressed at high levels in certain B cell lines and can be induced in normal B cells by treatment with TNF-alpha. To determine the signaling pathways that RGS1 may regulate, we examined the specificity of RGS1 for various G alpha subunits and assessed its effect on chemokine signaling. G protein binding and GTPase assays revealed that RGS1 is a Gi alpha and Gq alpha GTPase-activating protein and a potential G12 alpha effector antagonist. Functional studies demonstrated that RGS1 impairs platelet activating factor-mediated increases in intracellular Ca+2, stromal-derived factor-1-induced cell migration, and the induction of downstream signaling by a constitutively active form of G12 alpha. Furthermore, germinal center B lymphocytes, which are refractory to stromal-derived factor-1-triggered migration, express high levels of RGS1. These results indicate that RGS proteins can profoundly effect the directed migration of lymphoid cells.

10779778|a|Ag-mediated changes in B lymphocyte migration are important for normal immune function, yet the mechanisms by which these changes occur are poorly defined. Because chemokines direct many lymphocyte movements, molecules that regulate signaling by G protein-coupled chemokine receptors are likely to participate in Ag receptor-induced changes in cell migration. In this study, we have investigated the expression pattern and activity in murine B cells of members of the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) family of molecules. We present the sequence of mouse RGS1 and describe a novel short isoform of RGS3 that we term RGS3s. Following in vivo activation by Ag, B cells rapidly up-regulate expression of RGS1 and RGS2 while simultaneously decreasing expression of RGS3 and RGS14. Anergic hen egg lysozyme autoantigen-binding B cells are also shown to have slightly elevated RGS1 and RGS2 expression. CD40 signaling, by contrast, fails to cause rapid up-regulation of RGS1 or RGS2. Using a transient transfection approach in a mature B cell line, 2PK3, we demonstrate that RGS1 and RGS3s are effective inhibitors of chemotaxis toward the lymphoid tissue chemokines stromal cell-derived factor-1, B lymphocyte chemoattractant, and EBV-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine, whereas RGS2 has a minimal effect on migration to these chemokines. Together these findings support the conclusion that Ag-mediated changes in RGS molecule expression are part of the mechanism by which Ag receptor signaling regulates B cell migration within lymphoid tissues. The findings also suggest important roles for additional G protein-mediated events in B cell activation and tolerance.

To investigate the role of RGS2 in vivo, we generated rgs2-deficient mice. We show that targeted mutation of rgs2 in mice leads to reduced T cell proliferation and IL-2 production, which translates in an impaired antiviral immunity in vivo. Interestingly, rgs2(-/-) mice also display increased anxiety responses and decreased male aggression in the absence of cognitive or motor deficits. RGS2 also controls synaptic development and basal electrical activity in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Thus, RGS2 plays an important role in T cell activation, synapse development in the hippocampus, and emotive behaviors.

Peripheral blood-derived CD4+ "naive" (CD45RA+ RO-) T cells were stimulated in weekly intervals with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb, accessory cells, and exogenous cytokines, and were analyzed for cytokine secretion pattern. With the B cell line JY (B7-1+ B7-2+), as source of accessory cells, we could generate distinct Th subsets. Coculture with the combination of recombinant human (rh) IL-1beta and rhIL-6 gave rise to Th0-like cells, which secreted low levels of IFN-gamma and IL-5. The addition of rhIL-12 led to the generation of Th1-like cells, which secreted high levels of IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and upon multiple stimulations, significant levels of IL-10. The presence of rhIL-4 induced Th2-like cells that secreted high levels of IL-5 and IL-13, but undetectable levels of IL-4. Only after stimulation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore could these Th2-like cells be induced to secrete significant levels of IL-4, indicating distinct stimulatory requirements for the induction of IL-5 and IL-13 compared with IL-4. The B7-1-negative monocytic cell line U937 could only provide accessory cell-dependent costimulatory signals for the generation of Th1-like cells, while B7-1-transfected U937 cells acquired the capacity to provide costimulation for the generation of Th2-like cells. These results indicate a differential dependence on CD28-mediated costimulation for the generation of human Th1-like and Th2-like cells.

Six of the plasmids are designed for the construction and selection and high copy number replication in yeast. Six of the plasmids are designed for the construction and selection of cDNA libraries from various eukaryotic organisms, allowing directional cloning and expression of cDNAs.

11042171|a|A novel regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) has been isolated from a highly purified population of mouse long-term hematopoietic stem cells, and designated RGS18. It has 234 amino acids consisting of a central RGS box and short divergent NH(2) and COOH termini. The calculated molecular weight of RGS18 is 27,610 and the isoelectric point is 8.63. Mouse RGS18 is expressed from a single gene and shows tissue specific distribution. It is most highly expressed in bone marrow followed by fetal liver, spleen, and then lung. In bone marrow, RGS18 level is highest in long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cells, and is decreased as they differentiate into more committed multiple progenitors. The human RGS18 ortholog has a tissue-specific expression pattern similar to that of mouse RGS18. Purified RGS18 interacts with the alpha subunit of both G(i) and G(q) subfamilies. The results of in vitro GTPase single-turnover assays using Galpha(i) indicated that RGS18 accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha(i). Transient overexpression of RGS18 attenuated inositol phosphates production via angiotensin receptor and transcriptional activation through cAMP-responsive element via M1 muscarinic receptor.

9576926|a|RGS4, a mammalian GTPase activating protein for G protein alpha subunits, was identified by its ability to inhibit the pheromone response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To define regions of RGS4 necessary for its function in vivo, we assayed mutants for activity in this system. Deletion of the N-terminal 33 aa of RGS4 (Delta1-33) yielded a nonfunctional protein and loss of plasma membrane localization. These functions were restored by addition of a C-terminal membrane-targeting sequence to RGS4 (Delta1-33). Thus, plasma membrane localization is tightly coupled with the ability of RGS4 to inhibit signaling. Fusion of the N-terminal 33 aa of RGS4 to green fluorescent protein was sufficient to localize an otherwise soluble protein to the plasma membrane, defining this N-terminal region as a plasma membrane anchorage domain. RGS4 is palmitoylated, with Cys-2 and Cys-12 the likely sites of palmitoylation. Surprisingly, mutation of the cysteine residues within the N-terminal domain of RGS4 did not affect plasma membrane localization in yeast or the ability to inhibit signaling. Features of the N-terminal domain other than palmitoylation are responsible for the plasma membrane association of RGS4 and its ability to inhibit pheromone response in yeast.

10657631|a|Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins modulate signaling through pathways that use heterotrimeric G proteins as transducing elements. RGS1 is expressed at high levels in certain B cell lines and can be induced in normal B cells by treatment with TNF-alpha. To determine the signaling pathways that RGS1 may regulate, we examined the specificity of RGS1 for various G alpha subunits and assessed its effect on chemokine signaling. G protein binding and GTPase assays revealed that RGS1 is a Gi alpha and Gq alpha GTPase-activating protein and a potential G12 alpha effector antagonist. Functional studies demonstrated that RGS1 impairs platelet activating factor-mediated increases in intracellular Ca+2, stromal-derived factor-1-induced cell migration, and the induction of downstream signaling by a constitutively active form of G12 alpha. Furthermore, germinal center B lymphocytes, which are refractory to stromal-derived factor-1-triggered migration, express high levels of RGS1. These results indicate that RGS proteins can profoundly effect the directed migration of lymphoid cells.

8602223|a|A general property of signal transduction pathways is that prolonged stimulation decreases responsiveness, a phenomenon termed desensitization. Yeast cells stimulated with mating pheromone activate a heterotrimeric G-protein-linked, MAP-kinase-dependent signalling pathway that induces G1-phase cell-cycle arrest and morphological differentiation (reviewed in refs 1, 2). Eventually the cells desensitize to pheromone and resume growth. Genetic studies have demonstrated the relative importance of a desensitization mechanism that uses the SST2 gene product, Sst2p. Here we identify a mammalian gene family termed RGS (for regulator of G-protein signalling) that encodes structural and functional homologues of Sst2p. Introduction of RGS family members into yeast blunts signal transduction through the pheromone-response pathway. Like SST2 (refs 8-10), they negatively regulate this pathway at a point upstream or at the level of the G protein. The RGS family members also markedly impair MAP kinase activation by mammalian G-protein-linked receptors, indicating the existence and importance of an SST2-like desensitization mechanism in mammalian cells.

9079700|a|Genetic studies of molecules that negatively regulate G-coupled receptor functions have led to the identification of a large gene family with an evolutionarily conserved domain, termed the RGS domain. It is now understood that RGS proteins serve as GTPase-activating proteins for subfamilies of the heterotrimeric G-proteins. We have isolated from mouse pituitary a full-length cDNA clone encoding a novel member of the RGS protein family, termed RGS16, as well as the full-length cDNA of mRGS5 and mRGS2. Tissue distribution analysis shows that the novel RGS16 is predominantly expressed in liver and pituitary, and that RGS5 is preferentially expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. In contrast, RGS2 is widely expressed. Genetic analysis using the pheromone response halo assay and FUS1 gene induction assay show that overexpression of the RGS16 gene dramatically inhibits yeast response to alpha-factor, whereas neither RGS2 nor RGS5 has any discernible effect on pheromone sensitivity, pointing to a possible functional diversity among RGS proteins. In vitro binding assays reveal that RGS5 and RGS16 bind to Galphai and Galphao subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins, but not to Galphas. Based on mutational analysis of the conserved residues in the RGS domain, we suggest that the G-protein binding and GTPase-activating protein activity may involve distinct functional structures of the RGS proteins, indicating that RGS proteins may exert a dual function in the attenuation of signaling via G-coupled receptors.

7889942|a|Induction of the human c-fos proto-oncogene by mitogens depends on the formation of a ternary complex by p62TCF with the serum response factor (SRF) and the serum response element (SRE). We demonstrate that Elk-1, a protein closely related to p62TCF in function, is a nuclear target of two members of the MAP kinase family, ERK1 and ERK2. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 increases the yield of ternary complex in vitro. At least five residues in the C-terminal domain of Elk-1 are phosphorylated upon growth factor stimulation of NIH3T3 cells. These residues are also phosphorylated by purified ERK1 in vitro, as determined by a combination of phosphopeptide sequencing and 2-D peptide mapping. Conversion of two of these phospho-acceptor sites to alanine impairs the formation of ternary complexes by the resulting Elk-1 proteins. Removal of these serine residues also drastically diminishes activation of the c-fos promoter in epidermal growth factor-treated cells. Analogous mutations at other sites impair activation to a lesser extent without affecting ternary complex formation in vitro. Our results indicate that phosphorylation regulates ternary complex formation by Elk-1, which is a prerequisite for the manifestation of its transactivation potential at the c-fos SRE.

8774882|a|Signaling pathways using heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide-binding-proteins (G proteins) trigger physiological responses elicited by hormones, neurotransmitters and sensory stimuli. GTP binding activates G proteins by dissociating G alpha from G beta gamma subunits, and GTP hydrolysis by G alpha subunits deactivates G proteins by allowing heterotrimers to reform. However, deactivation of G-protein signalling pathways in vivo can occur 10- to 100-fold faster than the rate of GTP hydrolysis of G alpha subunits in vitro, suggesting that GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) deactivate G alpha subunits. Here we report that RGS (for regulator of G-protein signalling) proteins are GAPs for G alpha subunits. RGS1, RGS4 and GAIP (for G alpha-interacting protein) bind specifically and tightly to G alphai and G alpha0 in cell membranes treated with GDP and AlF4(-), and are GAPs for G alphai, G alpha0 and transducin alpha-subunits, but not for G alphas. Thus, these RGS proteins are likely to regulate a subset of the G-protein signalling pathways in mammalian cells. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms that govern the duration and specificity of physiological responses elicited by G-protein-mediated signalling pathways.

9856989|a|Regulators of heterotrimeric G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that accelerate GTP hydrolysis by Gq and Gi alpha subunits, thus attenuating signaling. Mechanisms that provide more precise regulatory specificity have been elusive. We report here that an N-terminal domain of RGS4 discriminated among receptor signaling complexes coupled via Gq. Accordingly, deletion of the N-terminal domain of RGS4 eliminated receptor selectivity and reduced potency by 10(4)-fold. Receptor selectivity and potency of inhibition were partially restored when the RGS4 box was added together with an N-terminal peptide. In vitro reconstitution experiments also indicated that sequences flanking the RGS4 box were essential for high potency GAP activity. Thus, RGS4 regulates Gq class signaling by the combined action of two domains: 1) the RGS box accelerates GTP hydrolysis by Galphaq and 2) the N terminus conveys high affinity and receptor-selective inhibition. These activities are each required for receptor selectivity and high potency inhibition of receptor-coupled Gq signaling.

10391923|a|Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) modulate G protein-mediated signaling pathways by acting as GTPase-activating proteins for Gi, Gq, and G12 alpha-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Although it is known that membrane association is critical for the biological activities of many RGS proteins, the mechanism underlying this requirement remains unclear. We reported recently that the NH2 terminus of RGS16 is required for its function in vivo. In this study, we show that RGS16 lacking the NH2 terminus is no longer localized to the plasma membrane as is the wild type protein, suggesting that membrane association is important for biological function. The region of amino acids 7-32 is sufficient to confer the membrane-targeting activity, of which amino acids 12-30 are predicted to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helix. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that the hydrophobic residues of the nonpolar face of the helix and the strips of positively charged side chains positioned along the polar/nonpolar interface of the helix are crucial for membrane association. Subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation followed by conditions that distinguish peripheral membrane proteins from integral ones indicate that RGS16 is a peripheral membrane protein. We show further that RGS16 membrane association does not require palmitoylation. Our results, together with other recent findings, have defined a unique membrane association domain with amphipathic features. We believe that these structural features and the mechanism of membrane association of RGS16 are likely to apply to the homologous domains in RGS4 and RGS5.

7536928|a|The development of megakaryocytes (MKs) from their marrow precursors is one of the least understood aspects of hematopoiesis. Current models suggest that early-acting MK colony-stimulating factors, such as interleukin (IL) 3 or c-kit ligand, are required for expansion of hematopoietic progenitors into cells capable of responding to late-acting MK potentiators, including IL-6 and IL-11. Recently, the Mp1 ligand, or thrombopoietin (Tpo), has been shown to display both MK colony-stimulating factor and potentiator activities, at potencies far greater than that of other cytokines. In light of these findings, we tested the hypothesis that Tpo is absolutely necessary for MK development. In this report we demonstrate that neutralizing the biological activity of Tpo eliminates MK formation in response to c-kit ligand, IL-6, and IL-11, alone and in combination, but that these reagents only partially reduce MK formation in the presence of combinations of cytokines including IL-3. However, despite the capacity of IL-3 to support the proliferation and initial stages of MK differentiation, elimination of Tpo prevents the full maturation of IL-3-induced MK. These data indicate that two populations of MK progenitors can be identified: one that is responsive to IL-3 but can fully develop only in the presence of Tpo and a second that is dependent on Tpo for both proliferation and differentiation. Thus, our results strongly suggest that Tpo is the primary regulator of MK development and platelet production.

9687531|a|Although thrombopoietin has been shown to promote megakaryocyte (MK) proliferation and maturation, the exact mechanism and site of platelet formation are not well defined. Studies have shown that MKs may transmigrate through bone marrow endothelial cells (BMEC), and release platelets within the sinusoidal space or lung capillaries. In search for chemotactic factor(s) that may mediate transmigration of MKs, we have discovered that mature polyploid MKs express the G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4 (Fusin, LESTR). Therefore, we explored the possibility that stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), the ligand for CXCR4, may also induce transendothelial migration of mature MKs. SDF-1, but not other CXC or CC chemokines, was able to mediate MK migration (ED50 = 125 pmol/liter). The MK chemotaxis induced by SDF-1 was inhibited by the CXCR4-specific mAb (12G5) and by pertussis toxin, demonstrating that signaling via the G protein-coupled receptor CXCR4 was necessary for migration. SDF-1 also induced MKs to migrate through confluent monolayers of BMEC by increasing the affinity of MKs for BMEC. Activation of BMEC with interleukin 1beta resulted in a threefold increase in the migration of MKs in response to SDF-1. Neutralizing mAb to the endothelial-specific adhesion molecule E-selectin blocked the migration of MKs by 50%, suggesting that cellular interaction of MKs with BMEC is critical for the migration of MKs. Light microscopy and ploidy determination of transmigrated MKs demonstrated predominance of polyploid MKs. Virtually all platelets generated in the lower chamber also expressed CXCR4. Platelets formed in the lower chamber were functional and expressed P-selectin (CD62P) in response to thrombin stimulation. Electron microscopy of the cells that transmigrated through the BMEC monolayers in response to SDF-1 demonstrated the presence of intact polyploid MKs as well as MKs in the process of platelet formation. These results suggest that SDF-1 is a potent chemotactic factor for mature MKs. Expression of CXCR4 may be the critical cellular signal for transmigration of MKs and platelet formation.

To further investigate the role and specificity of this receptor in regulating megakaryocytopoiesis, c-mpl-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting. The c-mpl-/- mice had an 85 percent decrease in their number of platelets and megakaryocytes but had normal amounts of other hematopoietic cell types. These mice also had increased concentrations of circulating TPO. These results show that c-mpl specifically regulates megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis through activation by its ligand TPO.

8630375|a|Mice with a null mutation in the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor c-Mpl were generated by gene targeting. c-mpl-deficient mice developed normally but were deficient in megakaryocytes and severely thrombocytopenic. The hematocrit and numbers of mature circulating leukocytes were normal in mpl-/- mice, as was the distribution of morphologically identifiable precursors in hematopoietic tissues. Bone marrow and spleen cells of adult mpl-/- mice lacked specific binding sites for TPO, were unresponsive to TPO in culture, and displayed a marked deficiency in progenitor cells with megakaryocytic potential. Significantly, total hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers were also reduced in mpl-/- mice including multipotential, blast cell, and committed progenitors of multiple lineages. The megakaryocyte deficiency was evident as early as 14 days of gestation in mpl-deficient mice, although reductions in progenitor cell numbers arose only later in development. The data suggest that the critical function of c-Mpl signalling in megakaryocytopoiesis is in maintenance of mature megakaryocyte numbers through control of progenitor cell proliferation and maturation. Moreover, our results also imply an important role for TPO and c-Mpl in the production of primitive pluripotent progenitor cells as well as progenitor cells committed to nonmegakaryocytic lineages.

8627177|a|Thrombopoietin (TPO) has recently been cloned and shown to regulate megakaryocyte and platelet production by activating the cytokine receptor c-mpl. To determine whether TPO is the only ligand for c-mpl and the major regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis, TPO deficient mice were generated by gene targeting. TPO-/- mice have a >80% decrease in their platelets and megakaryocytes but have normal levels of all the other hematopoietic cell types. A gene dosage effect observed in heterozygous mice suggests that the TPO gene is constitutively expressed and that the circulating TPO level is directly regulated by the platelet mass. Bone marrow from TPO-/- mice have decreased numbers of megakaryocyte-committed progenitors as well as lower ploidy in the megakaryocytes that are present. These results demonstrate that TPO alone is the major physiological regulator of both proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into mature megakaryocytes but that TPO is not critical to the final step of platelet production.

8111309|a|Megakaryocytopoiesis is the cellular developmental process prior to the release of platelets into the circulation. Regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis is a complex phenomenon that begins with commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to the replication and maturation of progenitor cells through endomitosis and megakaryocyte differentiation [1-4]. Platelet production is determined by the number and size of megakaryocytes in the marrow and may be regulated at two levels: at early stages of cell proliferation resulting in increased megakaryocyte numbers, and at later stages by endoreplication which increases DNA content and the size of megakaryocytes [5]. The mature megakaryocyte is a large polyploid cell with a highly defined invaginated membrane (demarcation membrane) and contains the membrane molecules necessary for platelet function [6-9]. Platelet shedding appears to occur by fragmentation of the cytoplasm of the megakaryocyte. Platelet release is thought to occur via transendothelial processes projecting into the vascular compartment [10, 11], although several studies indicate that megakaryocytes lodged in the lungs are capable of platelet formation [12-17]. The factors stimulating megakaryocytopoiesis in the lung have not been well characterized. In the past, the study of megakaryocyte development in vivo and in vitro was hampered by the rarity of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, the poorly defined cell populations, and inadequate assays. These prior studies of megakaryocyte development have been discussed in the recent past by R. Hoffman [1], N. Williams [3], and M. W. Long [2]. An attempt will be made in this review to highlight and synthesize various new concepts of regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis.

10648384|a|Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a CXC chemokine that acts as a stimulator of pre-B lymphocyte cell growth and as a chemoattractant for T cells, monocytes, and hematopoietic stem cells. More recent studies also suggest that megakaryocytes migrate in response to SDF-1. Because genetic elimination of SDF-1 or its receptor lead to marrow aplasia, we investigated the effect of SDF-1 on megakaryocyte progenitors (colony-forming units-megakaryocyte [CFU-MK]). We report that SDF-1 augments the growth of CFU-MK from whole murine bone marrow cells when combined with thrombopoietin (TPO). The addition of SDF-1 to interleukin-3 (IL-3) or stem cell factor (SCF) had no effect. Specific antagonists for CXCR4 (the sole receptor for SDF-1), T22, and 1-9 (P2G) SDF-1 reduced megakaryocyte colony growth induced by TPO alone, suggesting that many culture systems contain endogenous levels of the chemokine that contributes to the TPO effect. To examine whether SDF-1 has direct effects on CFU-MK, we developed a new protocol to purify megakaryocyte progenitors. CFU-MK were highly enriched in CD41(high) c-kit(high) cells generated from lineage-depleted TPO-primed marrow cells. Because the growth-promoting effects of SDF-1 were also observed when highly purified populations of CFU-MK were tested in serum-free cultures, these results suggest that SDF-1 directly promotes the proliferation of megakaryocytic progenitors in the presence of TPO, and in this way contributes to the favorable effects of the bone marrow microenvironment on megakaryocyte development.

2310823|a|Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a multifunctional protein specific to platelets, synthesized in megakaryocytes and stored in alpha granules. This report of our work shows that PF4 potently inhibits human megakaryocyte colony formation in vitro. Colony formation by megakaryocyte progenitor cells from normal bone marrows was studied using the plasma clot culture system and indirect immunoperoxidase staining. Nonadherent mononuclear cells were co-cultured with various concentrations (0 to 20 micrograms/mL) of highly purified human PF4. Statistically significant inhibition of three classes of megakaryocyte progenitor cells, the mixed colony forming unit-megakaryocytes (mCFU-MK), the burst forming unit-megakaryocytes (BFU-MK), and the colony forming unit-megakaryocytes (CFU-MK), was seen at a PF4 concentration of 2.5 micrograms/mL or greater. PF4 had no effect on erythroid (BFU-E) and granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) colony formation except at high concentration (5 micrograms/mL for BFU-E and 10 micrograms/mL for CFU-GM). When a concentration of 5 micrograms/mL PF4 was added at various time points during marrow culture, a reduction of megakaryocyte colony formation also occurred. In the presence of PF4 2.5 micrograms or 5 micrograms/mL, the percentage of mature type of colonies was found to be decreased compared with cultures with no added PF4. These data demonstrate that PF4 inhibits both proliferation and maturation of megakaryocyte progenitor cells in vitro and suggest that PF4 may play a role in autoregulating human megakaryocytopoiesis.

9246619|a|Over the last few years we have developed mass spectrometry-based approaches for selective identification of a variety of posttranslational modifications, and for sequencing the modified peptides. These methods do not involve radiolabeling or derivatization. Instead, modification-specific fragment ions are produced by collision-induced dissociation (CID) during analysis of peptides by ESMS. The formation and detection of these marker ions on-the-fly during the LC-ESMS analysis of a protein digest is a powerful technique for identifying posttranslationally modified peptides. Using the marker ion strategy in an orthogonal fashion, a precursor ion scan can detect peptides which give rise to a diagnostic fragment ion, even in an unfractionated protein digest. Once the modified peptide has been located, the appropriate precursor ion can be sequenced by tandem MS. The utility and interplay of this approach to mapping PTM is illustrated with examples that involve protein glycosylation and phosphorylation.

361735|a|Bacteriophage T4 carrying an amber mutation in gene 22 plus an amber mutation in gene 21 form aberrant, tubular structures termed rough polyheads, instead of complete phage when they infect Escherichia coli B. These rough polyheads consist almost entirely of the major capsid protein in its uncleaved form (gp23). When rough polyheads are treated under mild conditions with any of the five proteases, trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, pronase, or the protease from Staphylococcus aureus V8, the gp23 is rapidly hydrolyzed at a limited number of peptide bonds. In contrast, cleaved capsid protein (gp23) in mature phage capsids is completely resistant to proteolysis under the same conditions. A major project in this laboratory requires determining the primary structure of gp23, a large protein (Mr = 58,000) quite rich in those amino acids at which cleavages are achieved by conventional means. Recovery of peptides from the complex mixtures resulting from such cleavages proved to be extremely difficult. The limited proteolysis of gp23 in rough polyheads had yielded a set of large, easily purified fragments which are greatly simplifying the task of determining the primary structure of this protein.

5971783|a|1. A new method is described for ;fingerprinting' cysteic acid peptides derived from the disulphide bridges of proteins. Cystine peptides are separated by paper electrophoresis and oxidized on paper by performic acid vapour. Electrophoresis at right angles to the first direction produces parallel groups of cysteic acid peptides lying off a diagonal. This ;fingerprint' reveals the way in which the cysteic acid peptides were originally joined in the protein. 2. The method allows a very easy selective purification of cysteic acid peptides. 3. By applying this method to bovine chymotrypsinogen A, we found that the half-cystine residues were linked 1-122, 42-58, 136-201, 168-182 and 191-220.

3578767|a|A protein labeling procedure which enables detection of subpicomole quantities of proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels is described. Proteins are rendered fluorescent by reduction of disulfide bonds with dithiothreitol followed by alkylation with 5-N-[(iodoacetamidoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (5-I-AEDANS) or 5-iodoacetamido-fluorescein. Labeling is performed prior to electrophoresis, thus eliminating the need for staining with dyes and destaining after electrophoresis. As little as 375 fmol (25 ng) of prelabeled bovine serum albumin can be readily visualized after electrophoresis. Bands are still visible after electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose. Simultaneous labeling of proteins in complex mixtures is possible using this technique. This includes cysteine containing proteins of disrupted Newcastle disease virus. The magnitudes of the molecular weight increases which occur upon labeling reflect the cysteine contents of proteins. The mode of chemical modification for the prelabeling procedure was chosen because of its compatibility with analytical techniques, such as amino acid analysis, peptide mapping, or sequence analysis, which may be applied to the protein after electroelution from SDS-acrylamide gels. It replaces the need for reduction and carboxymethylation prior to these analytical procedures. Protein-sequence analysis of prelabeled bovine serum albumin, including samples electroeluted from SDS-acrylamide gels, has justified the choice of this method to facilitate isolation of proteins for sequence analysis. Equivalent sequence data were obtained with reduced bovine serum albumin S-alkylated with iodoacetic acid or 5-I-AEDANS.

Gorman, (1987) Anal. Biochem. 160, 376-387] has been investigated. Proteins studied include porcine insulin, chicken ovalbumin and bovine serum albumin. Amino acid analysis of the B-chain derivative of insulin revealed quantitative recovery of cysteine in its S-carboxymethyl form and no other carboxymethylated amino acid derivatives. Fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometric (FAB-MS) analysis of this derivative also indicated specific labeling of cysteine residues and automated stepwise protein sequence analysis of the derivative was performed to completion with initial and average repetitive yields of 73% and 96%, respectively. Tryptic peptides produced from the ovalbumin and serum albumin derivatives were fractionated by HPLC and subsequently analysed by amino acid analysis, FAB-MS and automated stepwise protein sequence analysis. These analyses have revealed that the labeling procedure exhibits a high degree of efficiency and is specifically directed towards S-alkylation of cysteine residues. The high level of fluorescence intensity of the label enabled specific detection of trace quantities of cysteine-containing peptides derived from contaminating protein(s). It is apparent that in addition to facilitating isolation of small quantities of proteins the labeling procedure is compatible with standard protein chemistry techniques involved in obtaining extensive structural data on isolated proteins.

9053038|a|Several peptides were shown to undergo fragmentation during matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to a degree which complicated their analysis using alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as a matrix, even at threshold laser irradiance. These peptides included synthetic peptides, peptides isolated from viral proteins and a phosphopeptide from beta-casein (residues 33-48). The excessive fragmentation occurred usually as a post-source phenomenon; however, in-source fragmentation was also observed. The combined effects of in-source and post-source fragmentation of one peptide studied led to a failure to observe the protonated molecule of this peptide in reflector mode analysis. The phosphopeptide studied exhibited a high degree of beta-elimination of phosphate. It was demonstrated that the fragility exhibited by these peptides in CHCA, including beta-elimination of phosphate from serine, was not evident with a matrix comprising 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone (DHAP) and di-ammonium hydrogen citrate (DAHC). The DHAP/DAHC matrix was also adapted for direct analysis of peptides from an acidic reducing milieu containing tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. The molecular weight of equine cytochrome c was determined with a relatively high degree of accuracy (experimental M(r) = 12360.2 +/- 1.4 Da compared to the theoretical M(r) = 12360.09 Da) using DHAP/DAHC as a matrix for reflector mode analysis.

9194191|a|The attachment protein or G protein of the A2 strain of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was digested with trypsin and the resultant peptides separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). One tryptic peptide produced a mass by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) corresponding to residues 152-187 with the four Cys residues of the ectodomain (residues 173, 176, 182, and 186) in disulfide linkage and absence of glycosylation. Sub-digestion of this tryptic peptide with pepsin and thermolysin produced peptides consistent with disulfide bonds between Cys173 and Cys186 and between Cys176 and Cys182. Analysis of ions produced by post-source decay of a peptic peptide during MALDI-TOF-MS revealed fragmentation of peptide bonds with minimal fission of an inter-chain disulfide bond. Ions produced by this unprecedented MALDI-induced post-source fragmentation corroborated the existence of the disulfide arrangement deduced from mass analysis of proteolysis products. These findings indicate that the ectodomain of the G protein has a non-glycosylated subdomain containing a "cystine noose."

2514795|a|Secondary amine cross-links occur in collagen and elastin from a number of tissue sources. Quantification of these cross-links by amino acid analysis is complicated by the problem of separating cross-links, which are often minor components, from the more common amino acids and also because relatively large amounts of a cross-link are required to determine a color factor. A specific radioactive labeling method has been developed and used to quantify cross-links in bone collagen. Primary amines such as lysine and hydroxylysine are first guanidinated with 3,5-dimethylpyrazole-1-carboxamidine nitrate (DMPC). Secondary amines, which are unreactive with DMPC, are then quantitatively cyanoethylated with [14C]acrylonitrile. This procedure can be used to detect any secondary amine cross-link, with higher sensitivity than ninhydrin analysis, in peptide form as well as in acid hydrolysates. It is applied here in conjunction with [3H]NaBH4 reduction to simultaneously quantify Schiff base cross-links and amounts of in vivo reduction of Schiff bases in mineralized versus nonmineralized bovine bone.

8355276|a|This paper describes a new method for the elucidation of the disulphide bonding pattern in a protein from an initial set of unrefined nuclear magnetic resonance solution structures. The use of both local and global proton-proton nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) distance information for the identification of the disulphide bridge network in cysteine-rich polypeptides was investigated by statistical analysis of the crystal structures of a selected group of proteins. There are six different types of inter-cysteine proton-proton distances which can potentially be used for the prediction of disulphide links. The uniqueness and the extent to which disulphide bonds could be identified by these distances was evaluated. Only NOEs between C beta H/C beta H and C alpha H/C beta H were shown to have positive predictive values for the characterization of disulphide links. Contrarily, the observation of an NOE between C alpha H and NH is a strong indication for the absence of a disulphide bridge between the two residues. The global analysis of the nuclear magnetic resonance data starts with the calculation of an initial set of conformers. First, pairing weights wij were assigned to all putative cysteine pairs in the protein according to a Gaussian-type distribution function from the C beta-C beta interatomic distances. In a second step, all conceivable disulphide patterns were formed by an exhaustive combinatorial enumeration. Statistical weights were then assigned to all patterns from the weights of the participating cysteine pairs. This method was validated with protein crystal structures deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank having three or more cysteine residues. It was then used to determine the previously unknown disulphide bonding pattern of the 12 cysteine residues of flavoridin.

2548332|a|Five serotypes of human rhinovirus (HRV) were examined for sensitivity to trypsin at physiological pH, HRV1A, HRV2, and HRV14 were found to be resistant whereas in serotypes HRV49 and HRV89 degradation of VP2 was observed. However, exposure to low pH followed by neutralization, a treatment which causes irreversible conformational changes in the capsid, led to rapid cleavage by trypsin of VP1 in HRV1A, HRV2, and HRV49 at defined sites followed by degradation of VP2. In the case of HRV2, the cleavage site in VP1 was determined by direct protein sequencing and was shown to occur between Arg260 and Thr261, close to the C-terminus. HRV49 behaves similarly to HRV2 as expected from extensive sequence similarity in this region, whereas VP1 in HRV1A is most probably cleaved at a site closer to the C-terminus than that in HRV2. Although HRV14 contains the same amino acid pair present in HRV2 and HRV49, it was not cleaved under these conditions. HRV89, which lacks a basic residue at the corresponding position, was also insensitive. Examination of the cleavage site on the three-dimensional structural map of native HRV2 reveals that it is most probably buried inside the capsid and thus not accessible. Structural rearrangements of the viral capsid are thus necessary to account for the cleavage observed after low pH treatment.

10204042|a|Peptide mass mapping using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry in conjunction with interrogation of sequence databases is a powerful tool for the identification of proteins. Glycosylated proteins often yield poor MALDI peptide maps due to shielding of proteolytic cleavage sites and the presence of modified peptides. Here we demonstrate that enzymatic removal of N-linked glycans with simultaneous partial (50%) 18O-labeling of glycosylated asparagine residues prior to proteolysis and MALDI peptide mass mapping can overcome these problems. As a result, more peptides are observed in MALDI spectra which, in turn, increases the specificity of subsequent database searches. Furthermore, the detection of a labeled peptide directly translates into partial sequence information as N-linked carbohydrates are exclusively attached to asparagine residues that form part of the NXS/T sequence. The mass of the formerly glycosylated peptide together with the NXS/T sequence pattern represents a discriminating criterion for database searching which, on average, increases the search specificity by a factor of 100. This procedure allows the unambiguous identification of glycoproteins that would otherwise require sequencing and, at the same time, enables the identification of N-glycosylation sites with higher sensitivity than previously possible.

9821327|a|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was used to characterize the F2 polypeptide of the fusion (F) protein of an avirulent isolate (VRI 82-6409) of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that was previously identified by immunochemical screening as having a variant cleavage activation sequence in its fusion protein precursor (F0). The major glycoform of the intact F2 polypeptide of the VRI 82-6409 isolate was 89 Da smaller than the F2 polypeptide of the avirulent V4 isolate of the Queensland strain of NDV. Analysis of AspN protease digests of the F2 polypeptides by MALDI/TOF-MS, with and without high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation, showed this mass difference to be due to a combination of differences in the extents of glycosylation and an amino acid difference in the AspN peptides derived from the C-termini of the F2 polypeptides. Accuracies achieved in analysis of the AspN peptides allowed the identification of this amino acid difference as glutamic acid in the VRI 82-6409 isolate compared with glycine in the V4 isolate. Analysis of fragments formed by post-source decay (PSD) of ions of the C-terminal AspN peptides localized the difference to the C-terminal residues of the respective F2 polypeptides. The present study demonstrated that MALDI/TOF-MS is a highly effective technique for the characterization of NDV variants identified by immunochemical screening of pathotype-specific epitopes at the C-termini of their F2 polypeptides.

10918372|a|A method for quantitating proteins and peptides in the low picomole and sub-picomole range has been developed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) with internal (18)O-labeled standards. A simple procedure is proposed to produce such internal standards for the tested sample by enzymatic hydrolysis of the same sample (with known concentration) in (18)O-water. A mathematical algorithm was developed which uses the isotopic patterns of the substance, the internal standard, and the substance/internal standard mixture for accurate quantitation of the substance. A great advantages of the proposed method is the absence of molecular weight limitation for the protein quantitation and the possibility of quantitation without previous fractionation of proteins and peptides. Using this strategy, the peptide angiotensinogen and two proteins, RNase and its protein inhibitor, were quantified by MALDI-time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry.

3919720|a|A new method for complementing existing protein chemical techniques for the assignment of S-S bridge positions in amino-acid sequences is described. The principle of the method is the direct examination of the masses of protein fragments, obtained by chemical or enzymatic degradation. Proteins are digested under conditions known to minimise disulphide reduction and reshuffling, and the unfractionated digest is examined directly by high field magnet (or other high mass) fast atom bombardment or Californium mass spectrometry. Disulphide linked peptides are identified from their unique masses, and by comparison with the spectrum of digested and reduced samples in which the signal corresponding to the S-S linked peptide(s) is replaced by two signals corresponding to the respective thiol peptide components, if INTER-bridged, or shifted by two mass units (dithiol) if INTRA-bridged. This rapid procedure has considerable potential in assisting with studies on the primary structure of proteins, in crystallographic studies and the monitoring of denaturation/renaturation of recombinant proteins.

10692451|a|Disulfide bonds stabilize the structure and functions of the hemagglutinin neuraminidase attachment glycoprotein (HN) of Newcastle disease virus. Until this study, the disulfide linkages of this HN and structurally similar attachment proteins of other members of the paramyxoviridae family were undefined. To define these linkages, disulfide-linked peptides were produced by peptic digestion of purified HN ectodomains of the Queensland strain of Newcastle disease virus, isolated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Analysis of peptides containing a single disulfide bond revealed Cys(531)-Cys(542) and Cys(172)-Cys(196) linkages and that HN ectodomains dimerize via Cys(123). Another peptide, with a chain containing Cys(186) linked to a chain containing Cys(238), Cys(247), and Cys(251), was cleaved at Met(249) with cyanogen bromide. Subsequent tandem mass spectrometry established Cys(186)-Cys(247) and Cys(238)-Cys(251) linkages. A glycopeptide with a chain containing Cys(344) linked to a chain containing Cys(455), Cys(461), and Cys(465) was treated sequentially with peptide-N-glycosidase F and trypsin. Further treatment of this peptide by one round of manual Edman degradation or tandem mass spectrometry established Cys(344)-Cys(461) and Cys(455)-Cys(465) linkages. These data, establishing the disulfide linkages of all thirteen cysteines of this protein, are consistent with published predictions that the paramyxoviridae HN forms a beta-propeller structural fold.

6418141|a|A novel mass-spectrometric technique is described that permits the identification of the C-terminal peptide of a protein. The technique involves the incorporation of 18O into all alpha-carboxy groups liberated during enzyme-catalysed partial hydrolysis of the protein, followed by mass spectrometry to identify as the C-terminal peptide the only peptide that did not incorporate any 18O. The technique has been used to identify the true C-terminal tryptic peptide of a bacterially produced gamma-interferon and to distinguish it from a peptide produced by anomalous tryptic cleavage. It was found that a closely similar sequence segment of bacterially produced alpha 2-interferon undergoes an analogous cleavage. The technique was also used to identify the C-terminus of a clipped gamma-interferon that retains full antiviral activity.

3281660|a|A previously described technique [Rose, Simona, Offord, Prior, Otto & Thatcher (1983) Biochem. J. 215, 273-277] permits the identification of the C-terminal peptide of a protein as the only peptide that does not incorporate any 18O upon partial enzymic hydrolysis in 18O-labelled water. Formation of chemical derivatives followed by combined g.l.c.-m.s. was used in this earlier work. We now describe the isolation from protein digests, by reversed-phase h.p.l.c., of labelled and unlabelled polypeptides and their direct analysis by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Under the conditions used, the 18O label is retained throughout the separation and analysis, thus permitting assignments of C-terminal peptides to be made. Enzyme-catalysed exchange of label into the terminal carboxy group was found to occur in some cases without hydrolysis of a peptide bond. This effect, which may be exploited to prepare labelled peptides, does not prevent application of the method (two separate digests must then be used). We have applied our method to the analysis of enzymic partial hydrolysates of glucagon, insulin and of several proteins produced by expression of recombinant DNA.

8783021|a|Proteins were digested in normal and highly 18O-enriched water using proteases commonly employed for protein sequencing. The extent of 18O incorporation into the resulting peptide fragments was characterized by electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS). The endoproteinases trypsin, Lys-C and Glu-C incorporate two atoms of 18O, resulting in a mass shift of +4 D for the peptide fragments. This indicates that, following proteolytic cleavage, peptide products continue to interact with these proteases and undergo repeated binding/hydrolysis cycles, resulting in complete equilibration of both oxygens in the carboxy terminus of the fragments with oxygen from solvent water. In contrast, chymotrypsin and Asp-N incorporate only one atom of 18O, resulting in a mass shift of +2 D, indicating that after the cleavage step these proteases do not accept the peptides as substrates. In addition, it was found that the proteases trypsin, Glu-C, and Lys-C exhibit minor or nontypical sequence specificities, resulting in unexpected peptide fragments. These fragments incorporate only one 18O atom, indicating that they do not undergo further binding/hydrolysis cycles with the enzyme. Thus, it is possible to discriminate between enzyme-typical peptide fragments with mass shifts of +4 D and nontypical fragments with mass shifts of only +2 D. Based on these observations, protein digest strategies are described for the generation of 1:1 ion doublets spaced either by 2 or 4 D. In addition, the C-terminus of a protein can be identified by the absence of an ion doublet in the corresponding peptide fragment. In protein sequencing by mass spectrometry, digest protocols generating ion doublets provide the most clear-cut analytical results for the recognition of ion series in ESI-MS/MS and MALDI post-source decay (PSD) product ion spectra. Only the mass spectrometric fragment ions of a C-terminal series show ion doublets spaced either by 2 or 4 D, whereas the fragment ions belonging to an N-terminal series remain unshifted. This assignment unequivocally reveals the direction of the identified sequence.

9204576|a|Protein microanalysis usually involves the sequencing of gel-separated proteins available in very small amounts. While mass spectrometry has become the method of choice for identifying proteins in databases, in almost all laboratories 'de novo' protein sequencing is still performed by Edman degradation. Here we show that a combination of the nanoelectrospray ion source, isotopic end labeling of peptides and a quadrupole/ time-of-flight instrument allows facile read-out of the sequences of tryptic peptides. Isotopic labeling was performed by enzymatic digestion of proteins in 1:1 16O/18O water, eliminating the need for peptide derivatization. A quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer was constructed from a triple quadrupole and an electrospray time-of-flight instrument. Tandem mass spectra of peptides were obtained with better than 50 ppm mass accuracy and resolution routinely in excess of 5000. Unique and error tolerant identification of yeast proteins as well as the sequencing of a novel protein illustrate the potential of the approach. The high data quality in tandem mass spectra and the additional information provided by the isotopic end labeling of peptides enabled automated interpretation of the spectra via simple software algorithms. The technique demonstrated here removes one of the last obstacles to routine and high throughput protein sequencing by mass spectrometry.

1952077|a|A new HPLC electrochemical detector that can be used to detect selectively and simultaneously both thiol- and disulfide-containing peptides is described. One electrode responds only to thiol-containing peptides, while a second electrode located downstream from a third electrode responds to thiol- as well as disulfide-containing peptides. All three electrodes are located in a single block and sample the HPLC effluent simultaneously. Since the electrochemical detector responds only to peptides that contain thiol or disulfide functionalities, it is ideal for detecting these types of peptides when they are present in complex mixtures. Peptides can be identified by their retention times if reference peptides are available, or by their molecular weights if the appropriate chromatographic fractions are collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The utility of the three-electrode electrochemical detector for detecting thiol- and disulfide-containing peptides in a single chromatographic analysis is illustrated with proteolytic digests of bovine alpha A-crystallin and partially reduced bovine insulin.

2980781|a|Factors affecting aspartimide formation, such as protecting groups, acidity, basicity, and temperature, were studied using the model tetrapeptide, Glu-Asp-Gly-Thr. The aspartyl carboxyl side chain in this tetrapeptide was either free or protected as a benzyl or cyclohexyl ester. Our results showed that the cyclohexyl ester led to far less aspartimide formation during acidic or tertiary amine treatment than the corresponding benzyl ester. The rate constants of aspartimide formation in HF-anisole (9:1, v/v) for the tetrapeptide protected as the benzyl ester were found to be 6.2 x 10(-6) and 73.6 x 10(-6) s-1 at -15 degrees and 0 degrees C respectively. These values were about three times faster than the corresponding free- or cyclohexyl ester-protected tetrapeptide. Little difference was seen when the studies were carried out at room temperature. The cyclohexyl protected tetrapeptide gave only 0.3% aspartimide in diisopropylethylamine treatment in 24 h, a 170-fold reduction of imide formation when compared with the benzyl protected tetrapeptide. Thus, using the cyclohexyl ester for aspartyl protection, our studies showed aspartimide formation could be significantly reduced to less than 2% under standard peptide synthesis conditions. Furthermore, with these model peptides, the mechanism of acid catalyzed aspartimide was studied in a range of HF concentrations. In dilute HF cleavage conditions (HF:dimethylsulfide 1:3, v/v), the mechanism was found to be of the AAC2 type, with the rate of aspartimide formation increasing very slowly with increasing acid concentration. In concentrated HF solutions (HF greater than 70% by volume), the rate of aspartimide formation increased rapidly with the increase in acid concentration. However, from model studies, the mechanism of aspartimide formation in concentrated HF was AAC2 rather than AAC1.

10757967|a|The applications of disulfide-bond chemistry to studies of protein folding, structure, and stability are reviewed and illustrated with bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A). After surveying the general properties and advantages of disulfide-bond studies, we illustrate the mechanism of reductive unfolding with RNase A, and discuss its application to probing structural fluctuations in folded proteins. The oxidative folding of RNase A is then described, focusing on the role of structure formation in the regeneration of the native disulfide bonds. The development of structure and conformational order in the disulfide intermediates during oxidative folding is characterized. Partially folded disulfide species are not observed, indicating that disulfide-coupled folding is highly cooperative. Contrary to the predictions of "rugged funnel" models of protein folding, misfolded disulfide species are also not observed despite the potentially stabilizing effect of many nonnative disulfide bonds. The mechanism of regenerating the native disulfide bonds suggests an analogous scenario for conformational folding. Finally, engineered covalent cross-links may be used to assay for the association of protein segments in the folding transition state, as illustrated with RNase A.

3706715|a|A new procedure is described for identification of disulfide bonds in peptides by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS). Prolonged bombardment of a disulfide-containing peptide in solution by a high-energy xenon beam results in gradual reduction of the disulfide bond. The reduction is the result of reaction intermediates initially produced by the xenon beam. The method for characterization of interchain disulfide bonds is based on the increase in the relative intensity of the pseudomolecular ions of the reduced peptides with a simultaneous decrease in the relative intensity of the protonated molecular ion of the oxidized peptide. This information allows one to identify peptide fragments covalently linked via intermolecular disulfide bonds. The intrachain disulfide bonds are identified by the increase in the relative intensity of the protonated molecular ion of the reduced peptide, relative to the intensity of the protonated molecular ion of the oxidized peptide. These results indicate that this method can be used to detect disulfide bonds of peptides and provides unambiguous information regarding disulfide bond assignment in peptides. Approximately 1 nmol of sample is required.

3818605|a|A rapid and sensitive method for assignment of disulfide bonds using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry is described for hen egg white lysozyme and bovine ribonuclease A. The protein is initially digested to a mixture of peptides using chemical and enzymatic methods under conditions which minimize disulfide bond reduction and exchange. The digested sample is analyzed directly by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry before and after chemical reduction of cystine residues. An important feature of the method is that it is not necessary to completely resolve the peptides in the digest chromatographically prior to analysis. The disulfide-containing peptides are also characterized directly by prolonged exposure of the sample to the high energy xenon atom beam which results in the reduction of cystine residues. Intra- as well as interchain disulfide bond assignments are made on the basis of the mass difference between the molecular ions (MH+) of the oxidized and reduced peptides. Confirmation of the mass assignments may be obtained from the mass spectra of the digests after one cycle of manual Edman degradation. Although the quantity of protein required to unambiguously assign all of the disulfide linkages will depend on the ease with which the appropriate peptide fragments can be formed, results from these studies indicate that approximately 1 nmol of protein is usually sufficient.

10972999|a|Cysteine residues and disulfide bonds are important for protein structure and function. We have developed a simple and sensitive method for determining the presence of free cysteine (Cys) residues and disulfide bonded Cys residues in proteins (<100 pmol) by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) in combination with protein database searching using the program Sequest. Free Cys residues in a protein were labeled with PEO-maleimide biotin immediately followed by denaturation with 8 M urea. Subsequently, the protein was digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin and the resulting products were analyzed by capillary LC/ESI-MS/MS for peptides containing modified Cys and/or disulfide bonded Cys residues. Although the MS method for identifying disulfide bonds has been routinely employed, methods to prevent thiol-disulfide exchange have not been well documented. Our protocol was found to minimize the occurrence of the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. The method was validated using well-characterized proteins such as aldolase, ovalbumin, and beta-lactoglobulin A. We also applied this method to characterize Cys residues and disulfide bonds of beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (five Cys), and human blood group A and B glycosyltransferases (four Cys). Our results demonstrate that beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase contains one free Cys residue and two disulfide bonds, which is in contrast to work previously reported using chemical methods for the characterization of free Cys residues, but is consistent with recently published results from x-ray crystallography. In contrast to the results obtained for beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase, none of the Cys residues in A and B glycosyltransferases were found to be involved in disulfide bonds.

1560538|a|Little is known about the assembly of the 28-nm nucleocapsid or core particle of hepatitis B virus. Here we show that this assembly process can be reconstituted in Xenopus oocytes injected with a synthetic mRNA encoding the hepatitis B virus capsid protein (p21.5). Injected oocytes produce both a nonparticulate p21.5 species (free p21.5) and capsid particles. We describe rapid and simple methods for fractionating these species on a small scale either with step gradients of 10 to 60% (wt/vol) sucrose or by centrifugation to pellet the particles, and we characterize the oocyte core particles. Free p21.5 exhibits chemical and physical properties distinctly different from those of particles. Free p21.5 is partially cleaved by proteinase K, whereas core particles are almost completely resistant to cleavage. This suggests that the carboxyl-terminal protamine region, the main target for proteases within p21.5, is exposed in free p21.5 but faces the interior of the p21.5 core particle. Finally, pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that free p21.5 can be chased almost quantitatively into core particles, establishing that free p21.5 is fully competent to form particles and represents an assembly intermediate on the pathway for core particle formation. However, core particle assembly appears very dependent on p21.5 concentration and is rapidly compromised if the p21.5 concentration is lowered. The advantages of oocytes for studying assembly are discussed.

10355322|a|The purpose of this article is to describe the conceptual bases and methods used in the ACTIVA multicenter study, as well as the process employed in the different stages of the research. General information is given on the approach, design, and methods that were applied in the cities that participated in the study: San Salvador, El Salvador; San José, Costa Rica; Cali, Colombia; Caracas, Venezuela; Salvador, Bahia, Brazil; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; and Madrid, Spain. The objectives of the study were to: (1) analyze and compare among cities the prevalence of verbal and physical aggressive behaviors toward children, the spouse or other partner, and persons outside the family; and (2) identify personal, environmental, and socioeconomic factors associated with these violent behaviors. The purpose of the ACTIVA project was to generate information to help guide violence-prevention policies and programs in the cities and to provide criteria for decision-making, as well as to obtain baseline data to use in evaluating prevention policies and programs. To achieve the proposed objectives, a single, common questionnaire was prepared and validated. The questionnaire was used in face-to-face interviews with residents of private urban homes who were between 18 and 70 years old. The sample was selected in each city through stratified multistage sampling of clusters proportionate to the socioeconomic strata of the general population and without any substitutions. The final sample consisted of 10,821 people. In general, the response rates were within the established limits. Exceptions included San José, Rio de Janeiro, and Madrid, where the size of the final sample was slightly smaller than anticipated. More young men of higher socioeconomic strata declined to participate, so that the samples had an overrepresentation of women from medium and lower strata. The article concludes with a description of the scope and limitations of the study, in terms of both the approach and methods. With their comparative analyses, studies of this type can contribute to identifying the differences and similarities between cities. The article shows that with this method it is possible to analyze how violent behaviors are associated with different risk factors and individuals' characteristics, at a point in time. However, this design is limited in terms of establishing causal relationships, and it did not allow an evaluation of the context of every specific instance of violence.

10355325|a|This article looks at eight cities in Latin America and Spain and compares the chances of and variables associated with being a victim of various kinds of urban violence. The analysis was done using data from the ACTIVA Multicenter Study, which was coordinated by the Pan American Health Organization in 1996. The study sample consisted of 10,821 persons who were representative of residents between the ages of 18 and 70 in eight metropolitan areas of Latin America and Spain: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Salvador, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; Cali, Colombia; San José, Costa Rica; San Salvador, El Salvador; Caracas, Venezuela; and Madrid, Spain. The results show that the likelihood of being a victim of different types of violence varies from city to city. The variables associated with a greater likelihood of being a victim in most--though not all--of the cities are sex, age, and consumption of alcohol.

10355323|a|The main purpose of this paper was to evaluate the strength of the association between: 1) aggressive behaviors and 2) attitudes and self-efficacy for alternatives to violence, in different cities of the Region of the Americas and Spain. Results were based on a cross-sectional house-hold survey of a sample of the population aged 18 to 70 years. The survey was conducted in eight metropolitan areas of Latin America and Spain: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Salvador, Bahia, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; Cali, Colombia; San José, Costa Rica; San Salvador, El Salvador; Caracas, Venezuela; and Madrid, Spain. Each sample of approximately 1,200 respondents per city was stratified by clusters and was proportional in terms of socioeconomic position and population density. In all cities and for all targets of aggression studied, people who reported using aggression were less likely to feel confident that they could solve conflicts without violence, and they were more likely to hold attitudes supporting violence. Young persons were also more likely to commit aggression against all the targets. In addition, aggression toward nonfamily members was found most frequently among young men who reported binge drinking, who either carried a firearm or would have liked to carry one, or who perceived the police as inefficient. Additional studies need to be done in each country to describe more specific attitudes associated with aggression within each subculture. Future prevention programs should focus on modifying attitudes that support violence, increasing self-efficacy in solving problems without using violence, supporting the development of a police system that people can trust, regulating firearms and access to alcohol, and raising people's education levels.

7735021|a|Use of general population surveys in addition to institutional samples is critical to disentangling the relationship between criminal behavior and alcohol problems or use of illicit drugs. Local area studies can be useful but generalizability of their results is seldom studied. Data from recent US national (n = 2058) and county (n = 3069) general population surveys are used to examine the role of alcohol problem and drug use history in predicting self-reported criminal behavior, arrest and conviction within a logistic regression framework. In the national and county surveys controlling for age, gender, income, marital status, employment, education, race and drug use, lifetime drinking problems significantly predicted current criminal behavior (odds ratios 1.3 and 1.5, respectively) with slightly stronger relationships noted in equivalent models predicting arrest (odds ratios 1.7 and 1.8) and conviction (odds ratios 1.7 and 1.6). Relationships between alcohol, drugs and criminal behavior/justice variables are discussed. Parallels between US and county results suggest that findings from intensive, articulated analyses of community-level population and institutional surveys may be cautiously generalized beyond their geographic locus.

Psychiatric assessment of survey respondents was based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, which also provided self-report information about violent behavior. Those who reported violent behavior within the preceding year tended to be young, male, and of low socioeconomic status, and more than half met DSM-III criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders. Subjects with alcohol or drug use disorders were more than twice as likely as those with schizophrenia to report violent behavior. In a multivariate model of the predictors of violence, a significant interaction effect was found between major mental illness and substance abuse. The risk of violent behavior increased with the number of psychiatric diagnoses for which respondents met DSM-III criteria.

8202027|a|Fecal isolates of Escherichia coli which were collected from human patients in different parts of Germany between 1985 and 1992 were examined for production of verotoxins (VT). Among 2165 isolates 54 (2.5%) verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) were found. The 54 VTEC belonged to 13 different serotypes, 46 (85.2%) of these were enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) types as O157:H7, O157:H-, O145:H-, O111:[H8] and O26:[H11]. Of the 54 VTEC 50 (92.6%) hybridized with one or both of the DNA probes specific for VT1 and VT2. The 4 VTEC strains which were negative for VT1 and VT2 differed from all other VTEC by many phenotypical trains such as serotype, production of alpha-hemolysin and absence of EHEC-plasmid and "attaching and effacing" (eae)-specific DNA sequences. In contrast, VTEC which were positive for VT1, VT2 or both were frequently positive for eae sequences (92.0%), EHEC-plasmids (90.0%) and for production of enterohemolysin (88.0%). With enterohemolysin as an epidemiological marker more VTEC strains (81.5%) could be identified than with others such as the absence of beta-glucuronidase activity (61.1%) or non-fermentation of sorbitol (48.1%). Case reports were available for 42 of the 54 VTEC strains. The clinical presentation of 42 cases with VTEC ranged from uncomplicated diarrhea to severe diseases as hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, bloody diarrhea, HC and HUS were more associated with the O157 group than with other VTEC groups.

EaeA-negative STEC were found in 35 (39.3%) of the patients and were more associated with clinically uncomplicated cases and adult patients.

9986802|a|Associations between known or putative virulence factors of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and disease in humans were investigated. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis of a set of 237 isolates from 118 serotypes showed significant associations between the presence of genes for intimin (eae) and Shiga toxin 2 (stx2) and isolates from serotypes reported in humans. Similar associations were found with isolates from serotypes reported in hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) hemolysin gene was significantly associated with isolates from serotypes found in severe diseases in univariate analysis but not in multivariate logistic regression models. A strong association between the intimin and EHEC-hemolysin genes may explain the lack of statistical significance of EHEC hemolysin in these multivariate models, but a true lack of biological significance of the hemolysin in humans or in disease cannot be excluded. This result warrants further investigations of this topic. Multivariate analysis revealed an interaction between the eae and stx2 genes, thus supporting the hypothesis of the synergism between the adhesin intimin and Shiga toxin 2. A strong statistical association was observed between the stx2 gene and severity of disease for a set of 112 human isolates from eight major serotypes. A comparison of 77 isolates of bovine origin and 91 human isolates belonging to six major serotypes showed significant associations of the genes for Shiga toxin 1 and EspP protease with bovine isolates and an increased adherence on HEp-2 cell cultures for human isolates, particularly from diarrheic patients and healthy persons.

1554712|a|Like ricin, Escherichia coli Shiga-like toxin I (SLT-I) inactivates eukaryotic ribosomes by catalytically depurinating adenosine 4324 in 28S rRNA. Although the primary structure of the enzymatic portion of the molecule (Slt-IA) is known to contain regions of significant homology to the ricin A chain (RTA), and although certain residues have been implicated in catalysis, the crystal structure of Slt-IA has not been solved nor has the geometry of its active site been well defined. In order to derive a more complete understanding of the nature of the Slt-IA active site, we placed the slt-IA gene under control of an inducible promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Induction of the cloned element was lethal to the host. This lethality was the basis for selection of an attenuated mutant of Slt-IA changed at tyrosine 77, a locus not previously linked to the active site. As well, it permitted evaluation of the toxicity of a number of mutant Slt-IA cassettes that we constructed in vitro. Putative active-site residues implicated in this fashion and in other studies were mapped to an energy-minimized computer model of Slt-IA that had been generated on the basis of the known crystal structure of RTA. A cleft was identified on one face of the protein in which all implicated residues clustered, irrespective of their distances from one another in the primary structure of the molecule. Many of the chemical features anticipated in the active site of an RNA N-glycosidase are indeed present on the amino acid side chains occupying the cleft.

11770615|a|The aim of this study was to characterize verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) isolates obtained from humans and pigs in the same geographic areas and during the same period of time in order to determine whether porcine VTEC isolates could be related to human cases of diarrhea and also to detect the presence of virulence factors in these isolates. From 1,352 human and 620 porcine fecal samples, 11 human and 18 porcine verotoxin-positive isolates were obtained by the VT immunoblot or the individual colony testing technique. In addition, 52 porcine VTEC strains isolated from diseased pigs at the Faculté de médecine vétérinaire during the same period or from fecal samples collected previously isolated at slaughterhouses were characterized in this study. Antimicrobial resistance profiles were different between human and porcine isolates. In general, the serotypes observed in the two groups were different. No porcine isolate was of serotype O157:H7; however, one isolate was O91:NM, a serotype that has been associated with hemorrhagic colitis in humans. Also, one serotype (O8:H19) was found in isolates from both species; however, the O8:H19 isolates of the two groups were of different pathotypes. The pathotypes observed in the human and porcine isolates were different, with the exception of VT2vx-positive isolates; the serotypes of these isolates from the two groups were nevertheless different. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis indicated no relatedness between the human and porcine isolates. In conclusion, these results suggest that the porcine and human isolates of the present study were not genetically related. Most porcine VTEC isolates did not possess known virulence factors required to infect humans. However, certain non-O157:H7 porcine VTECs may potentially infect humans.

10508077|a|A total of five hybridoma cell lines that produced monoclonal antibodies against the components of the hemolysin BL (HBL) enterotoxin complex and sphingomyelinase produced by Bacillus cereus were established and characterized. Monoclonal antibody 2A3 was specific for the B component, antibodies 1A12 and 8B12 were specific for the L(2) component, and antibody 1C2 was specific for the L(1) protein of the HBL enterotoxin complex. No cross-reactivity with other proteins produced by different strains of B. cereus was observed for monoclonal antibodies 2A3, 1A12, and 8B12, whereas antibody 1C2 cross-reacted with an uncharacterized protein of approximately 93 kDa and with a 39-kDa protein, which possibly represents one component of the nonhemolytic enterotoxin complex. Antibody 2A12 finally showed a distinct reactivity with B. cereus sphingomyelinase. The monoclonal antibodies developed in this study were also successfully applied in indirect enzyme immunoassays for the characterization of the enterotoxic activity of B. cereus strains. About 50% of the strains tested were capable of producing the HBL enterotoxin complex, and it could be demonstrated that all strains producing HBL were also highly cytotoxic.

11473999|a|All human Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) non-O157 strains (n = 56) isolated in Finland from 1990 to August 2000 were characterized for the O:H serotype, stx(1) and stx(2) genes, production of enterohemolysin, and sensitivity to 12 antimicrobial agents. Strains of the same serotype were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after XbaI restriction of total DNA. The 56 non-O157 isolates belonged to 29 serotypes. Two of the serotypes (O102:H7 and OX181:H49) have not previously been described as being associated with STEC infections in humans or isolated from animals. Thirty-four strains (61%) within seven serotypes (O103:H2 [14 isolates], O26:H11 [6 isolates], O145:H28 [4 isolates], O145:HNM [3 isolates], O15:HNM [3 isolates], OX174:H21 [2 isolates], and O Rough:HNM [2 isolates]) were represented by more than one isolate. Of these strains, O103:H2 isolates were divided into seven, O26:H11 isolates were divided into four, and the rest within a serotype were divided into two genotypes in PFGE. In PCR, 31 (55%) of the 56 strains were positive for the stx(2) gene only and 24 strains (43%) were positive for stx(1) only. One strain (O43:H2) carried both stx(1) and stx(2). Forty-two strains (75%) produced enterohemolysin, and 39 strains (70%) possessed the eae gene. Of the latter 39 strains, 36 (92%) were enterohemolytic, whereas only 6 (35%) of the 17 isolates lacking the eae gene were enterohemolytic (P < 0.001). The majority of the strains (44 strains, 79%) were sensitive to all 12 antimicrobials tested. Of the 56 strains, 20 (36%) were associated with small family outbreaks in nine families and 14 (25%) were associated with recent travel abroad.

9111051|a|Shiga toxin consists of an enzymatically active A-chain and a pentameric binding subunit. The A-chain has a trypsin-sensitive region, and upon cleavage two disulfide bonded fragments, A1 and A2, are generated. To study the role of the disulfide bond, it was eliminated by mutating cysteine 242 to serine. In T47D cells this mutated toxin was more toxic than wild type toxin after a short incubation, whereas after longer incubation times wild type toxin was most toxic. Cells cleaved not only wild type but also mutated A-chain into A1 and A2 fragments. The mutated A-chain was more sensitive than wild type toxin to Pronase, and it was degraded at a higher rate in T47D cells. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated transport of both wild type and mutated toxin to the Golgi apparatus. Brefeldin A, which disrupts the Golgi apparatus, protected not only against Shiga toxin but also against the mutated toxin, indicating involvement of the Golgi apparatus. After prebinding of Shiga(C242S) toxin to wells coated with the Shiga toxin receptor, Gb3, trypsin treatment induced dissociation of A1 from the toxin-receptor complex demonstrating that in addition to stabilizing the A-chain, the disulfide bond prevents dissociation of the A1 fragment from the toxin-receptor complex.

3333796|a|A nucleotide sequence analysis was performed on the Shiga-like toxin I genes previously cloned from the Escherichia coli bacteriophage 933J. Two structural genes designated slt-I A and slt-I B were found to be oriented on a single transcriptional unit with slt-I A preceding slt-I B. A 12 base pair gap separated the in-phase open reading frames of slt-I A and slt-I B. Putative ribosome binding sites were identified 5' to both the slt-I A and slt-I B genes. Translation of the SLT-I nucleotide sequence revealed that both the A and B subunits were synthesized with signal peptides. The molecular weight calculated for the mature A subunit was 32,211 while the molecular weight of the mature B subunit was 7690.

2687320|a|By using a single synthetic oligonucleotide primer pair in the polymerase chain reaction, we amplified specific Shiga-like-toxin (SLT) gene segments from DNAs of 20 clinical Escherichia coli isolates, irrespective of whether they produce SLT-I, SLT-II, or heretofore uncategorized SLTs. These segments were not detectable in any of 20 nontoxigenic E. coli strains. The primers deduced from a conserved region among SLT genes are so-called degenerate-sequence primers; i.e., they contain intentionally introduced sequence ambiguities to overcome minor sequence variations within different SLT genes. In direct gel hybridization with genomic DNA, both primers recognized SLT-I and SLT-II DNA sequences. Amplified sequences of target DNA obtained by polymerase chain reaction were visualized after gel electrophoresis by ethidium bromide staining, and definitive identification of the amplification product as an SLT gene segment was achieved by hybridization to SLT-I- and SLT-II-specific 20-base oligonucleotide probes complementary to a portion of the amplified sequences but not to the primers. The detecting oligonucleotide probes shared only 30% base homology and were shown to recognize specifically SLT-I or SLT-II sequences within genomic DNA. Moreover, they were used to distinguish whether the amplified sequence originated from SLT-I or SLT-II genes. The PCR system with the primers described here is a powerful technique to amplify SLT sequences in E. coli strains that produce serologically distinct SLTs and will facilitate identification of these pathogens, particularly among a multitude of nonpathogenic E. coli strains.

3886804|a|Forty pediatric patients with idiopathic hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) were investigated for evidence of infection by Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). Fecal VTEC (belonging to at least six different O serogroups including O26, O111, O113, O121, O145, and O157) or specifically neutralizable free-fecal Verotoxin (VT) or both were detected in 24 (60%) patients but were not detected in 40 matched controls. Ten of 15 of the former developed fourfold or greater rises in VT-neutralizing antibody titers, as did six other patients who were negative for both fecal VTEC and VT. A total of 30 (75%) patients had evidence of VTEC infection by one or more criteria. We concluded that a significant association exists between idiopathic HUS and infection by VTEC. The detection of free-fecal VT was the most important procedure for the early diagnosis of this infection because, in our study, VTEC were never isolated in the absence of fecal VT, whereas fecal VT was often present even when VTEC were undetectable.

11682520|a|A specific PCR for the detection of a variant of the gene encoding Shiga toxin 1 (stx(1)) called stx(1(OX3)) (GenBank accession no. Z36901) was developed. The PCR was used to investigate 148 Stx(1)-producing Escherichia coli strains from human patients (n = 72), cattle (n = 27), sheep (n = 48), and a goat (n = 1) for the presence of the stx(1(OX3)) gene. The stx(1(OX3)) gene was present in 38 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains from sheep belonging to serogroups O5, O125, O128, O146, and OX3 but was absent from Stx(1)-positive ovine STEC O91 strains. The stx(1(OX3)) gene was also detected in 22 STEC strains from humans with nonbloody diarrhea and from asymptomatic excreters. Serotypes O146:H21 and O128:H2 were most frequently associated with stx(1(OX3))-carrying STEC from sheep and humans. In contrast, Stx(1)-producing STEC strains from cattle and goats and 50 STEC strains from humans were all negative for the stx(1(OX3)) gene. The stx(1(OX3))-negative strains belonged to 13 serotypes which were different from those of the stx(1(OX3))-positive STEC strains. Moreover, the stx(1(OX3)) gene was not associated with STEC belonging to enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) serogroups O26, O103, O111, O118, O145, and O157. A bacteriophage carrying the stx(1(OX3)) gene (phage 6220) was isolated from a human STEC O146:H21 strain. The phage was able to lysogenize laboratory E. coli K-12 strain C600. Phage 6220 shared a similar morphology and a high degree of DNA homology with Stx(2)-encoding phage 933W, which originates from EHEC O157. In contrast, few similarities were found between phage 6220 and Stx(1)-encoding bacteriophage H-19B from EHEC O26.

10376814|a|Members of the bacterial Shiga toxin family consist of a single A subunit that is non-covalently associated with a pentamer of B subunits. These toxins bind to receptors on susceptible mammalian cells and enter the cells by endocytic uptake. During cell entry, the 32 kDa A subunit is cleaved by the membrane-anchored protease furin to generate a catalytically active, 27.5 kDa A1 fragment and a 4.5 kDa A2 fragment. Previous studies have shown that mutating the furin site to prevent cleavage did not significantly affect toxin potency, suggesting that cleavage is not required for toxin activity. Here it is confirmed that preventing cleavage at the usual processing site does not prevent proteolytic processing of the Escherichia coli Shiga-like toxin-1 A subunit. However, simultaneous mutation of both the primary furin-recognition site and a nearby putative furin cleavage site did prevent intracellular processing of the A subunit. Comparison of the cytotoxicities of purified recombinant toxins to cultured mammalian cells demonstrated that even on prolonged incubation with toxin, the unprocessed mutant was 60-fold less toxic than the wild-type protein or other mutants still capable of being proteolytically processed during cell entry.

9485303|a|Shiga-like toxin I (SLT-I) is a virulence factor of Escherichia coli strains that cause disease in humans. Like other members of the Shiga toxin family, it consists of an enzymatic (A) subunit and five copies of a binding subunit (the B-pentamer). The B-pentamer binds to a specific glycolipid, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), on the surface of target cells and thereby plays a crucial role in the entry of the toxin. Here we present the crystal structure at 2.8 A resolution of the SLT-I B-pentamer complexed with an analogue of the Gb3 trisaccharide. The structure reveals a surprising density of binding sites, with three trisaccharide molecules bound to each B-subunit monomer of 69 residues. All 15 trisaccharides bind to one side of the B-pentamer, providing further evidence that this side faces the cell membrane. The structural model is consistent with data from site-directed mutagenesis and binding of carbohydrate analogues, and allows the rational design of therapeutic Gb3 analogues that block the attachment of toxin to cells.

8335264|a|PCR amplification was used to screen faecal isolates of Escherichia coli from a 12-month-old boy with haemolytic uraemic syndrome for the presence of Shiga-like toxin (SLT)-encoding genes. One isolate, belonging to serotype O111:H-, was positive for SLT-I by this method. UV induction indicated that the strain was lysogenic for a lambdoid bacteriophage, but this did not encode the toxin. Southern hybridization analysis of chromosomal DNA revealed that the SLT-I gene was located on an 8.5-kb EcoRI fragment. SLT-I was further localized to within a 3.0-kb SphI-EcoRI fragment. A separate subclone contained a 3.75-kb HindIII fragment, 1.18 kb of which was common to both. Nucleotide sequence analysis of derivatives of these clones revealed that the SLT-I A subunit gene from E. coli O111:H- differed from the previously published sequences for SLT-I by 5 bp [resulting in two amino acid (aa) changes]. It was more closely related to the gene encoding the A subunit of the Shiga toxin from Shigella dysenteriae type 1, from which it differed by 3 bp (resulting in one aa change). The DNA sequence of the B subunit-encoding gene was identical to that of the other two toxins. The region of DNA upstream from the SLT-I of E. coli O111:H- contained an IS element, as well as a region with strong homology to a portion of the genome of bacteriophage lambda.

These fragments were cloned and DNA sequence analysis identified several variations, as compared with published sltI sequences. All three sltI genes analysed were more closely related to Shiga toxin-encoding genes (sht) of Shigella dysenteriae type 1, than to previously published E. coli phage-encoded sltI genes.

9774585|a|The sequence of a verocytotoxin 2 (VT2) variant gene that was untypeable by the B subunit PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) method described by Tyler et al. (S. D. Tyler, W. M. Johnson, H. Lior, G. Wang, and K. R. Rozee, J. Clin. Microbiol. 29:1339-1343, 1991) was determined and compared with published sequences. It was highly homologous to two recently reported VT2 variant sequences. The PCR-RFLP method described by Tyler et al. was extended to include these new sequences. New VT2 variants were identified in 65 of 359 VT-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) with newly designed primers (VT2-cm and VT2-f) and were characterized as well by restriction analysis of the amplification products obtained with another VT2-specific primer pair (VT2-e and VT2-f). The VT genes harbored by 64 of these isolates proved to be untypeable by Tyler's PCR-RFLP method because no amplification was obtained with the primers used with this method (VT2-c and VT2-d). The last isolate harbored the new variant gene in addition to VT2vh-a. None of the isolates harboring these new toxin genes belonged to serogroups O157, O26, O103, O111, and O145. All 65 isolates were negative for the eaeA gene and were significantly less frequently enterohemolytic or positive for the enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) virulence plasmid than non-O157 VTEC isolates harboring other VT2 genes. They were also less frequently isolated from patients with EHEC-associated symptoms. The extended PCR-RFLP typing method is a useful tool to identify less-virulent VTEC isolates and for VT genotyping in epidemiological studies with non-O157 strains.

7858348|a|Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) have the ability to cause 'attaching and effacing' (AE) lesions; the genes necessary to cause AE in both of these pathogroups have been identified and termed eae. Using colony hybridization, we screened 237 stool samples from patients with diarrhea, and 237 stool samples from age-matched controls for the presence of E. coli carrying eae. Individual colonies harbouring eae could be recovered from 7 (2.9%) of the patient stools, as well as from 6 (2.5%) of the control stools. All these E. coli isolates were positive in the fluorescence actin staining (FAS) test. In addition, all the samples were also probed for Shiga-like toxin (slt) genes and the EPEC adherence factor (EAF) to evaluate whether testing for eae identified all EHEC and class I EPEC. Of the 7 patient samples harbouring E. coli with eae, 4 had E. coli with eae and slt genes, and 2 had E. coli with eae and EAF sequences. In 2 of the 237 patient stools, E. coli which were eae and EAF negative but slt probe positive could be recovered. These 2 E. coli strains were non-reactive in the FAS test. Of the control samples, none of the E. coli strains, including the 6 samples containing eae positive strains, possessed EAF or slt-sequences. In concrete terms, the similar eae incidence found in both E. coli isolates from patients and controls is currently of limited clinical diagnostic value and more importantly, the eae probe could not identify all slt-harbouring E. coli. On the basis of these results, the use of the eae-probe cannot be recommended in preference to the slt probes for the detection of EHEC.

7868227|a|In this study, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5.4-kb SalI restriction fragment of the recombinant plasmid pEO40-1, cloned from the large plasmid of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 strain EDL 933. This revealed two open reading frames which shared approximately 60% homology to the hlyC and hlyA genes of the E. coli alpha-hemolysin (alpha-hly) operon. We termed these genes EHEC-hlyA and EHEC-hlyC to distinguish them from the alpha-hly genes. Preliminary sequence analysis indicated that another open reading frame homolog to the hlyB gene is located close to the 3' end of EHEC-hlyA. The predicted molecular masses of the EHEC-hlyA and EHEC-hlyC gene products were 107 and 19.9 kDa, respectively. The EHEC hemolysin protein (EHEC-Hly) was not secreted into the culture supernatant by the strain EDL 933. However, hemolytic activity was found in the broth culture supernatant after transforming EDL 933 with the recombinant plasmid pRSC6 carrying the hlyB and hlyD genes from the E. coli alpha-hemolysin operon. The EHEC hemolysin was precipitated and used as an antigen for immunoblot analysis. This demonstrated that 19 of 20 reconvalescent-phase serum samples from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome reacted specifically with the antigen; conversely, only 1 of 20 control serum samples demonstrated reactivity. To investigate the prevalence of EHEC hemolysin genes in diarrheagenic E. coli, a PCR was developed to specifically detect EHEC-hlyA. All Shiga-like toxin-producing O157 strains and 12 of 25 Shiga-like toxin-producing non-O157 strains were PCR positive; strains of other categories of diarrheagenic E. coli were PCR negative. All PCR-positive strains hybridized with the CVD 419 probe. We found the CVD 419 probe to be identical to the 3.4-kb HindIII fragment of plasmid pEO40 carrying most of the EHEC-hlyA gene and a part of the putative EHEC-hlyB gene. In this study, the newly discovered EHEC hemolysin was shown to be responsible for the enterohemolytic phenotype and demonstrated to be related but not identical to alpha-hemolysin. The EHEC hemolysin appears to have clinical importance because it occurs in all O157 strains tested and is reactive to sera of patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome.

10698793|a|We have isolated Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains from the feces of feral pigeons which contained a new Stx2 variant gene designated stx(2f). This gene is most similar to sltIIva of patient E. coli O128:B12 isolate H.I.8. Stx2f reacted only weakly with commercial immunoassays. The prevalence of STEC organisms carrying the stx(2f) gene in pigeon droppings was 12.5%. The occurrence of a new Stx2 variant in STEC from pigeons enlarges the pool of Stx2 variants and raises the question whether horizontal gene transfer to E. coli pathogenic to humans may occur.

1997410|a|Thirty-two clinical isolates of Shiga-like toxin (SLT)-producing Escherichia coli associated with single cases or outbreaks of bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, the hemolytic uremic syndrome, or edema disease of swine were examined for multiple copies of genes belonging to the slt-I or slt-II toxin families. Five of 19 strains that were known to produce SLT-II or to hybridize to slt-II-specific probes by colony blot were found by Southern hybridization to contain two copies of toxin genes related to slt-II. The genes for two toxins closely related to slt-II were cloned from one of the isolates, Escherichia coli O157:H- strain E32511. One copy of the operon was found to be essentially identical to slt-II; it differed from slt-II by only one nucleotide base. This single nucleotide difference did not affect the predicted amino acid sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence of the A subunit of the second operon was identical to that of SLT-II, but the predicted amino acid sequence of the B subunit was identical to that of the B2F1 toxin VT2ha. We designated this second operon slt-IIc. Neutralization assays using several monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antiserum prepared against SLT-II showed that SLT-IIc was antigenically related to but distinct from SLT-II.

3905611|a|Three monoclonal antibodies, designated MAb 16E6, MAb 13C4, and MAb 19G8, were produced which recognize Shiga-like toxin (SLT) from Escherichia coli. All three monoclonal antibodies neutralized the cytotoxicity of E. coli SLT and were able to immunoprecipitate intact labeled toxin with Staphylococcus aureus protein A. The three antibodies were of the G1 heavy and kappa light chain classes. MAb 16E6 bound to the B subunit of SLT in Western blots and also neutralized the lethality of the toxin for mice and the enterotoxicity of the toxin in ligate rabbit ileal loops. The ability of MAb 16E6 to neutralize the cytotoxicity, lethality, and enterotoxicity of E. coli confirms the hypothesis that all three activities are associated with a single toxin. MAb 16E6 and MAb 13C4 also neutralized the cytotoxicity of purified Shiga toxin from Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and Shiga-like toxic activities in crude cell extracts from Shigella flexneri, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Thus, Shiga toxin and the SLTs from E. coli, Shigella flexneri, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and Salmonella typhimurium share a common B subunit epitope that is involved in neutralization. MAb 13C4 has been successfully used in a colony blot assay for the detection of bacterial colonies which produce high levels of SLT. Sixty-two different strains of bacteria were tested by both the cytotoxicity and colony blot assays for the presence of SLT. The colony blot assay detected all strains of bacteria which produce greater than or equal to 10(5) 50% cytotoxic doses of SLT per ml of sonic lysate. There were no false-positive results among the 62 samples tested.

2830229|a|The structural genes for Shiga toxin, designated stx A and stx B, were cloned from Shigella dysenteriae type 1 3818T, and a nucleotide sequence analysis was performed. Both stx A and stx B were present on a single transcriptional unit, with stx A preceding stx B. The molecular weight calculated for the processed A subunit was 32,225, while the molecular weight of the processed B subunit was 7,691. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences for Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxin I (SLT-I) from Escherichia coli revealed that the genes for Shiga toxin and SLT-I were greater than 99% homologous; three nucleotide changes were detected in three separate codons of the A subunits. Only one of these codon differences resulted in a change in the amino acid sequence: a threonine in Shiga toxin at position 45 of the A subunit compared with a serine in the corresponding position in SLT-I. Furthermore, Shiga toxin and SLT-I had identical signal peptides for the A and B subunits, as well as identical ribosome-binding sites, a putative promoter, and iron-regulated operator sequences. These findings indicate that Shiga and SLT-I are essentially the same toxin. Southern hybridization studies with total cellular DNA from several Shigella strains and internal toxin probes for SLT-I and its antigenic variant SLT-II showed that a single fragment in S. dysenteriae type 1 hybridized strongly with the internal SLT-I probe. Fragments with weaker homology to the SLT-I probe were detected in S. flexneri type 2a but no other shigellae. No homology between the Shiga-like toxin II (SLT-II) probe and any of the Shigella DNAs was detected. Whereas SLT-I and SLT-II are phage encoded, no phage could be induced from S. dysenteriae type 1 or other Shigella spp. tested. These results suggest that the Shiga (SLT-I) toxin genes responsible for high toxin production are present in a single copy in S. dysenteriae type 1 but not in other shigellae. The findings further suggest that SLT-II genes are absent in shigellae, as are toxin-converting phages.

3070268|a|The primary structures of the A and B subunits of Shiga toxin and of Shiga-like toxin I (VT1), isolated from the culture supernatants of Shigella dysenteriae 1 and Escherichia coli O157:H7, respectively, were analyzed by Edman degradation of intact proteins and peptides in their digests with trypsin or Achromobacter protease I and also by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the digests. The results indicated that the A and B subunits of Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxin I have the same primary structures. The identity of their primary structures was confirmed by determining the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding Shiga-like toxin I cloned from a Shiga-like toxin I converting phage. This nucleotide sequence was different from that reported by Jackson et al. (Microbial Pathogenesis 1987; 2: 147-153), by Calderwood et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1987; 84: 4364-8) and by Grandis et al. (J Bacteriol 1987; 169: 4313-9) in one base at position 231, which was found to be adenine instead of thymine, which they reported. The amino acid residue at position 45 from the N-terminus of the A subunit of Shiga-like toxin I deduced from the nucleotide sequence determined in this study is threonine, which corresponds with that found by amino acid sequencing, whereas from previous reports by other investigators it is serine. Edman degradation of the intact A subunit of Shiga toxin indicated that the A subunit was nicked between Ala253 and Ser254 to form A1 and A2 fragments linked by a disulfide bond.

3045088|a|A Shiga-like toxin type II variant (SLT-IIv) is produced by strains of Escherichia coli responsible for edema disease of swine and is antigenically related to Shiga-like toxin type II (SLT-II) of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. However, SLT-IIv is only active against Vero cells, whereas SLT-II is active against both Vero and HeLa cells. The structural genes for SLT-IIv were cloned from E. coli S1191, and the nucleotide sequence was determined and compared with those of other members of the Shiga toxin family. The A subunit genes for SLT-IIv and SLT-II were highly homologous (94%), whereas the B subunit genes were less homologous (79%). The SLT-IIv genes were more distantly related (55 to 60% overall homology) to the genes for Shiga toxin of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and the nearly identical Shiga-like toxin type I (SLT-I) of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. (These toxins are referred to together as Shiga toxin/SLT-I.) The A subunit of SLT-IIv, like those of other members of this toxin family, had regions of homology with the plant lectin ricin. SLT-IIv did not bind to galactose-alpha 1-4-galactose conjugated to bovine serum albumin, which is an analog of the eucaryotic cell receptor for Shiga toxin/SLT-I and SLT-II. These findings support the hypothesis that SLT-IIv binds to a different cellular receptor than do other members of the Shiga toxin family but has a similar mode of intracellular action. The organization of the SLT-IIv operon was similar to that of other members of the Shiga toxin family. Iron did not suppress SLT-IIv or SLT-II production, in contrast with its effect on Shiga toxin/SLT-I. Therefore, the regulation of synthesis of SLT-IIv and SLT-II differs from that of Shiga toxin/SLT-I.

11880423|a|Sixty-seven human strains of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) (from patients with more or less severe symptoms) were serogrouped and arranged according to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. We used PCR to investigate the strains according to known or putative virulence factors, and associations with disease were studied. All EHEC strains with the same PFGE pattern belonged to the same serogroup. On the contrary, two serogroups (O157 and O8) included strains with different PFGE patterns. We found several different combinations of chromosomal and plasmid-borne determinants, encoding the putative virulence factors, among the strains. As judged from clinical symptoms, there was no marked difference in pathogenicity among the strains and their combinations of virulence traits. All strains of O157 had the genes coding for verocytotoxin (VT) 2, intimin (eaeA), E. coli hemolysin (E-hly), and secreted serine protease (espP). Among EHEC non-O157 strains, the genes coding for VT1 and VT2 were equally dispersed. EaeA positivity was just as common among VT1- as VT2-positive strains. Among the plasmid-borne determinants, E-hly and espP were the most common and E-hly might be a pathogenicity marker among EHEC non-O157 strains. The conclusion is that PFGE is a very useful tool in epidemiological studies. The EHEC plasmids are heterogeneous in their gene composition, with the four plasmid-borne determinants found in many combinations. There was no reliable correlation between chromosomal and plasmid-borne virulence factors and human disease.

11923370|a|By using sequence analysis of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx 1) genes from human and ovine Stx-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains, we identified an Stx1 variant in STEC of human origin that was identical to the Stx1 variant from ovine STEC, but demonstrated only 97.1 and 96.6% amino acid sequence identity in its A and B subunits, respectively, to the Stx1 encoded by bacteriophage 933J. We designated this variant "Stx1c" and developed stxB(1) restriction fragment length polymorphism and stx(1c)-specific PCR strategies to determine the frequency and distribution of stx(1c) among 212 STEC strains isolated from humans. stx(1c) was identified in 36 (17.0%) of 212 STEC strains, 19 of which originated from asymptomatic subjects and 16 of which were from patients with uncomplicated diarrhea. stx(1c) was most frequently (in 23 STEC strains [63.9%]) associated with stx(2d), but 12 (33.3%) of the 36 STEC strains possessed stx(1c) only. A single STEC strain possessed stx(1c) together with stx(2) and was isolated from a patient with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. All 36 stx(1c)-positive STEC strains were eae negative and belonged to 10 different serogroups, none of which was O157, O26, O103, O111, or O145. Stx1c was produced by all stx(1c)-containing STEC strains, but reacted weakly with a commercial immunoassay. We conclude that STEC strains harboring the stx(1c) variant account for a significant proportion of human STEC isolates. The procedures developed in this study now allow the determination of the frequency of STEC strains harboring stx(1c) among clinical STEC isolates and their association with human disease in prospective studies.

9811907|a|ATP-sensitive potassium ("KATP") channels are rapidly inhibited by intracellular ATP. This inhibition plays a crucial role in the coupling of electrical activity to energy metabolism in a variety of cells. The KATP channel is formed from four each of a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) regulatory subunit and an inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir6.2) pore-forming subunit. We used systematic chimeric and point mutagenesis, combined with patch-clamp recording, to investigate the molecular basis of ATP-dependent inhibition gating of mouse pancreatic beta cell KATP channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We identified distinct functional domains of the presumed cytoplasmic C-terminal segment of the Kir6.2 subunit that play an important role in this inhibition. Our results suggest that one domain is associated with inhibitory ATP binding and another with gate closure.

The availability of this method, and the resulting models, has however been restricted by the availability of expensive computer hardware and software. To overcome these limitations, we have developed an environment for comparative protein modeling that consists of SWISS-MODEL, a server for automated comparative protein modeling and of the SWISS-PdbViewer, a sequence to structure workbench. The Swiss-PdbViewer not only acts as a client for SWISS-MODEL, but also provides a large selection of structure analysis and display tools. In addition, we provide the SWISS-MODEL Repository, a database containing more than 3500 automatically generated protein models. By making such tools freely available to the scientific community, we hope to increase the use of protein structures and models in the process of experiment design.

9705987|a|1. Using a chimeric protein comprising the green fluorescent protein (GFP) linked to the C-terminus of the K+ channel protein mouse Kir6.2 (Kir6.2-C-GFP), the interactions between the sulphonylurea receptor SUR1 and Kir6.2 were investigated in transfected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) by combined imaging and patch clamp techniques. 2. HEK 293 cells transfected with mouse Kir6.2-C-GFP and wild-type Kir6.2 exhibited functional K+ channels independently of SUR1. These channels were inhibited by ATP (IC50 = 150 microM), but were not responsive to stimulation by ADP or inhibition by sulphonylureas. Typically 15 +/- 7 active channels were found in an excised patch. 3. The distribution of Kir6.2-C-GFP protein was investigated by imaging of GFP fluorescence. There was a lamellar pattern of fluorescence labelling inside the cytoplasm (presumably associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus) and intense punctate labelling near the cell membrane, but little fluorescence was associated with the plasma membrane. 4. In contrast, cells co-transfected with Kir6.2-C-GFP and SUR1 exhibited intense uniform plasma membrane labelling, and the lamellar and punctate labelling seen without SUR1 was no longer prominent. 5. In cells co-transfected with Kir6.2-C-GFP and SUR1, strong membrane labelling was associated with very high channel activity, with 484 +/- 311 active channels per excised patch. These K+ channels were sensitive to inhibition by ATP (IC50 = 17 microM), stimulated by ADP and inhibited by sulphonylureas. 6. We conclude that co-expression of SUR1 and Kir6.2 generates channels with the properties of native KATP channels. In addition, SUR1 promotes uniform insertion of Kir6.2-C-GFP into the plasma membrane and a 35-fold increase in channel activity, suggesting that SUR1 facilitates protein trafficking of Kir6.2 into the plasma membrane.

11528481|a|Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are crucial components of visual, olfactory and gustatory signalling pathways. They open in response to direct binding of intracellular cyclic nucleotides and thus contribute to cellular control of both the membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ levels. Cytosolic Ni2+ potentiates the rod channel (CNG1) response to cyclic nucleotides and inhibits the olfactory channel (CNG2) response. Modulation is due to coordination of Ni2+ by channel-specific histidines in the C-linker, between the S6 transmembrane segment and the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. Here we report, using a histidine scan of the initial C-linker of the CNG1 channel, stripes of sites producing Ni2+ potentiation or Ni2+ inhibition, separated by 50 degrees on an alpha-helix. These results suggest a model for channel gating where rotation of the post-S6 region around the channel's central axis realigns the Ni2+-coordinating residues of multiple subunits. This rotation probably initiates movement of the S6 and pore opening.

12507423|a|Inward rectifier K(+) channels govern the resting membrane voltage in many cells. Regulation of these ion channels via G protein-coupled receptor signaling underlies the control of heart rate and the actions of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. We have determined the protein structure formed by the intracellular N- and C termini of the G protein-gated inward rectifier K(+) channel GIRK1 at 1.8 A resolution. A cytoplasmic pore, conserved among inward rectifier K(+) channels, extends the ion pathway to 60 A, nearly twice the length of a canonical transmembrane K(+) channel. The cytoplasmic pore is lined by acidic and hydrophobic amino acids, creating a favorable environment for polyamines, which block the pore. These results explain in structural and chemical terms the basis of inward rectification, and they also have implications for G protein regulation of GIRK channels.

9831713|a|1. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are composed of pore-forming Kir6.2 and regulatory SUR subunits. A truncated isoform of Kir6.2, Kir6.2DeltaC26, expresses ATP-sensitive channels in the absence of SUR1, suggesting the ATP-inhibitory site lies on the Kir6. 2 subunit. 2. We examined the effect on the channel ATP sensitivity of mutating the arginine residue at position 50 (R50) in the N-terminus of Kir6.2, by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type or mutant Kir6.2DeltaC26. 3. Substitution of R50 by serine, alanine or glycine reduced the Ki for ATP inhibition from 117 microM to 800 microM, 1.1 mM and 3.8 mM, respectively. The single-channel conductance and kinetics were unaffected by any of these mutations. Mutation to glutamate, lysine, asparagine, glutamine or leucine had a smaller effect (Ki, approximately 300-400 microM). The results indicate that the side chain of the arginine residue at position 50 is unlikely to contribute directly to the binding site for ATP, and suggest it may affect ATP inhibition by allosteric interactions. 4. Mutation of the isoleucine residue at position 49 to glycine (I49G) reduced the channel ATP sensitivity, while the mutation of the glutamate residue at position 51 to glycine (E51G) did not. 5. When a mutation in the N-terminus of Kir6.2DeltaC26 that alters ATP sensitivity (R50S; Ki, 800 microM) was combined with one in the C-terminus (E179Q; Ki, 300 microM), the Ki for the apparent ATP sensitivity was increased to 2.8 mM. The Hill coefficient was also increased. This suggests that the N- and C-termini of Kir6.2 may co-operate to influence channel closure by ATP.

12524280|a|K(ATP) channels are comprised of a pore-forming protein, Kir6.x, and the sulfonylurea receptor, SURx. Interaction of adenine nucleotides with Kir6.2 positively charged amino acids such as K185 and R201 on the C-terminus causes channel closure. Substitution of these amino acids with other positively charged residues had small effects on inhibition by adenine nucleotide, while substitution with neutral or negative residues had major effects, suggesting electrostatic interactions between Kir6.2 positive charges and adenine nucleotide negative phosphate groups. Furthermore, R201 mutation decreased channel sensitivity to ATP, ADP, and AMP to a similar extent, but K185 mutation decreased primarily ATP and ADP sensitivity, leaving the AMP sensitivity relatively unaffected. Thus, channel inhibition by ATP may involve interaction of the alpha-phosphate with R201 and interaction of the beta-phosphate with K185. In addition, decreased open probability due to rundown or sulfonylureas caused an increase in ATP sensitivity in the K185 mutant, but not in the R201 mutant. Thus, the beta-phosphate may bind in a state-independent fashion to K185 to destabilize channel openings, while R201 interacts with the alpha-phosphate to stabilize a channel closed configuration. Substitution of R192 on the C-terminus and R50 on the N-terminus with different charged residues also affected ATP sensitivity. Based on these results a structural scheme is proposed, which includes features of other recently published models.

10545134|a|1. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are composed of pore-forming Kir6.2 and regulatory SUR subunits. A truncated isoform of Kir6.2, Kir6.2DeltaC26, forms ATP-sensitive channels in the absence of SUR1, suggesting the ATP-inhibitory site lies on Kir6.2. 2. Previous studies have shown that mutation of the lysine residue at position 185 (K185) in the C-terminus of Kir6.2 to glutamine, decreased the channel sensitivity to ATP without affecting the single-channel conductance or the intrinsic channel kinetics. This mutation also impaired 8-azido[32P]-ATP binding to Kir6.2. 3. To determine if K185 interacts directly with ATP, we made a range of mutations at this position, and examined the effect on the channel ATP sensitivity by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type or mutant Kir6.2DeltaC26. 4. Substitution of K185 by a positively charged amino acid (arginine) had no substantial effect on the sensitivity of the channel to ATP. Mutation to a negatively charged residue markedly decreased the channel ATP sensitivity: the Ki for ATP inhibition increased from 85 microM to >30 mM when arginine was replaced with aspartic acid. Substitution of neutral residues had intermediate effects. 5. The inhibitory effects of ADP, ITP and GTP were also reduced when K185 was mutated to glutamine or glutamate. 6. The results indicate that a positively charged amino acid at position 185 is required for high-affinity ATP binding to Kir6.2. Our results demonstrate that ATP does not interact with the side-chain of K185. It remains unclear whether ATP interacts with the backbone of this residue, or whether its mutation influences ATP binding allosterically.

11055989|a|Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) activates K(ATP) and other inward rectifier (Kir) channels. To determine residues important for PIP(2) regulation, we have systematically mutated each positive charge in the COOH terminus of Kir6.2 to alanine. The effects of these mutations on channel function were examined using (86)Rb efflux assays on intact cells and inside-out patch-clamp methods. Both methods identify essentially the same basic residues in two narrow regions (176-222 and 301-314) in the COOH terminus that are important for the maintenance of channel function and interaction with PIP(2). Only one residue (R201A) simultaneously affected ATP and PIP(2) sensitivity, which is consistent with the notion that these ligands, while functionally competitive, are unlikely to bind to identical sites. Strikingly, none of 13 basic residues in the terminal portion (residues 315-390) of the COOH terminus affected channel function when neutralized. The data help to define the structural requirements for PIP(2) sensitivity of K(ATP) channels. Moreover, the regions and residues defined in this study parallel those uncovered in recent studies of PIP(2) sensitivity in other inward rectifier channels, indicating a common structural basis for PIP(2) regulation.

9628866|a|ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are both inhibited and activated by intracellular nucleotides, such as ATP and ADP. The inhibitory effects of nucleotides are mediated via the pore-forming subunit, Kir6.2, whereas the potentiatory effects are conferred by the sulfonylurea receptor subunit, SUR. The stimulatory action of Mg-nucleotides complicates analysis of nucleotide inhibition of Kir6. 2/SUR1 channels. We therefore used a truncated isoform of Kir6.2, that expresses ATP-sensitive channels in the absence of SUR1, to explore the mechanism of nucleotide inhibition. We found that Kir6.2 is highly selective for ATP, and that both the adenine moiety and the beta-phosphate contribute to specificity. We also identified several mutations that significantly reduce ATP inhibition. These are located in two distinct regions of Kir6.2: the N-terminus preceding, and the C-terminus immediately following, the transmembrane domains. Some mutations in the C-terminus also markedly increased the channel open probability, which may account for the decrease in apparent ATP sensitivity. Other mutations did not affect the single-channel kinetics, and may reduce ATP inhibition by interfering with ATP binding and/or the link between ATP binding and pore closure. Our results also implicate the proximal C-terminus in KATP channel gating.

11526842|a|Changes in the voltage clamp currents of squid giant axons wrought by low axoplasmic TEA+ (tetraethylammonium chloride) concentrations (0.3 mM and above) are described. They are: (a) For positive steps from the resting potential in sea water, the K+ current increases, decreases, then increases, instead of increasing monotonically. (b) For positive steps from the resting potential in 440 mM external K+, the current has an exponentially decaying component, whose decay rate increases with axoplasmic [TEA+]. The control currents increase monotonically. (c) For negative steps from the resting potential in 440 mM external K+, the current record has a peak followed by a decay that is slow relative to the control. The control record decreases monotonically. Qualitatively these findings can be described by a simple kinetic model, from which, with one assumption, it is possible to calculate the rate at which K+ ions move through the K+ channels. An interesting conclusion from (c) is that the channels cannot be closed by the normal voltage-sensitive mechanism (described by Hodgkin and Huxley) until they are free of TEA+.

4112955|a|Quaternary ammonium ions were applied to the inside of single myelinated nerve fibers by diffusion from a cut end. The resulting block of potassium channels in the node of Ranvier was studied under voltage-clamp conditions. The results agree in almost all respects with similar studies by Armstrong of squid giant axons. With tetraethylammonium ion (TEA), pentyltriethylammonium ion (C(5)), or nonyltriethylammonium ion (C(9)) inside the node, potassium current during a depolarization begins to rise at the normal rate, reaches a peak, and then falls again. This unusual inactivation is more complete with C(9) than with TEA. Larger depolarizations give more block. Thus the block of potassium channels grows with time and voltage during a depolarization. The block reverses with repolarization, but for C(9) full reversal takes seconds at -75 mv. The reversal is faster in 120 mM KCl Ringer's and slower during a hyperpolarization to -125 mv. All of these effects contrast with the time and voltage-independent block of potassium, channels seen with external quaternary ammonium ions on the node of Ranvier. External TEA, C(5), and C(9) block without inactivation. The external quaternary ammonium ion receptor appears to be distinct from the inner one. Apparently the inner quaternary ammonium ion receptor can be reached only when the activation gate for potassium channels is open. We suggest that the inner receptor lies within the channel and that the channel is a pore with its activation gate near the axoplasmic end.

8917595|a|Many blockers of Na+ and K+ channels act by blocking the pore from the intracellular side. For Shaker K+ channels, such intracellular blockers vary in their functional effect on slow (C-type) inactivation: Some blockers interfere with C-type inactivation, whereas others do not. These functional differences can be explained by supposing that there are two overlapping "subsites" for blocker binding, only one of which inhibits C-type inactivation through an allosteric effect. We find that the ability to bind to these subsites depends on specific structural characteristics of the blockers, and correlates with the effect of mutations in two distinct regions of the channel protein. These interactions are important because they affect the ability of blockers to produce use-dependent inhibition.

8571129|a|Quaternary ammonium blockers inhibit many voltage-activated potassium (K+) channels from the intracellular side. When applied to Drosophila Shaker potassium channels expressed in mammalian cells, these rapidly reversible blockers produced use-dependent inhibition through an unusual mechanism--they promoted an intrinsic conformational change known as C-type inactivation, from which recovery is slow. The blockers did so by cutting off potassium ion flow to a site in the pore, which then emptied at a rate of 10(5) ions per second. This slow rate probably reflected the departure of the last ion from the multi-ion pore: Permeation of ions (at 10(7) per second) occurs rapidly because of ion-ion repulsion, but the last ion to leave would experience no such repulsion.

11689945|a|K+ channels are transmembrane proteins that are essential for the transmission of nerve impulses. The ability of these proteins to conduct K+ ions at levels near the limit of diffusion is traditionally described in terms of concerted mechanisms in which ion-channel attraction and ion-ion repulsion have compensating effects, as several ions are moving simultaneously in single file through the narrow pore. The efficiency of such a mechanism, however, relies on a delicate energy balance-the strong ion-channel attraction must be perfectly counterbalanced by the electrostatic ion-ion repulsion. To elucidate the mechanism of ion conduction at the atomic level, we performed molecular dynamics free energy simulations on the basis of the X-ray structure of the KcsA K+ channel. Here we find that ion conduction involves transitions between two main states, with two and three K+ ions occupying the selectivity filter, respectively; this process is reminiscent of the 'knock-on' mechanism proposed by Hodgkin and Keynes in 1955. The largest free energy barrier is on the order of 2-3 kcal mol-1, implying that the process of ion conduction is limited by diffusion. Ion-ion repulsion, although essential for rapid conduction, is shown to act only at very short distances. The calculations show also that the rapidly conducting pore is selective.

11479347|a|TEA is a classical blocker of K(+) channels. From mutagenesis studies, it has been shown that external blockade by TEA is strongly dependent upon the presence of aromatic residue at Shaker position 449 which is located near the extracellular entrance to the pore (Heginbotham, L., and R. MacKinnon. 1992. Neuron. 8:483-491). The data suggest that TEA interacts simultaneously with the aromatic residues of the four monomers. The determination of the 3-D structure of the KcsA channel using X-ray crystallography (Doyle, D.A., J.M. Cabral, R.A. Pfuetzner, A. Kuo, J.M. Gulbis, S.L. Cohen, B.T. Chait, and R. MacKinnon. 1998. Science. 280:69-77) has raised some issues that remain currently unresolved concerning the interpretation of these observations. In particular, the center of the Tyr82 side chains in KcsA (corresponding to position 449 in Shaker) forms a square of 11.8-A side, a distance which is too large to allow simultaneous interactions of a TEA molecule with the four aromatic side chains. In this paper, the external blockade by TEA is explored by molecular dynamics simulations of an atomic model of KcsA in an explicit phospholipid bilayer with aqueous salt solution. It is observed, in qualitative accord with the experimental results, that TEA is stable when bound to the external side of the wild-type KcsA channel (with Tyr82), but is unstable when bound to a mutant channel in which the tyrosine residue has been substituted by a threonine. The free energy profile of TEA relative to the pore is calculated using umbrella sampling simulations to characterize quantitatively the extracellular blockade. It is found, in remarkable agreement with the experiment, that the TEA is more stably bound by 2.3 kcal/mol to the channel with four tyrosine residues. In the case of the wild-type KcsA channel, TEA (which has the shape of a flattened oblate spheroid) acts as an ideal plug blocking the pore. In contrast, it is considerably more off-centered and tilted in the case of the mutant channel. The enhanced stability conferred by the tyrosine residues does not arise from Pi-cation interactions, but appears to be due to differences in the hydration structure of the TEA. Finally, it is shown that the experimentally observed voltage dependence of TEA block, which is traditionally interpreted in terms of the physical position of the TEA along the axis of the pore, must arise indirectly via coupling with the ions in the pore.

9525859|a|The potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans is an integral membrane protein with sequence similarity to all known K+ channels, particularly in the pore region. X-ray analysis with data to 3.2 angstroms reveals that four identical subunits create an inverted teepee, or cone, cradling the selectivity filter of the pore in its outer end. The narrow selectivity filter is only 12 angstroms long, whereas the remainder of the pore is wider and lined with hydrophobic amino acids. A large water-filled cavity and helix dipoles are positioned so as to overcome electrostatic destabilization of an ion in the pore at the center of the bilayer. Main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from the K+ channel signature sequence line the selectivity filter, which is held open by structural constraints to coordinate K+ ions but not smaller Na+ ions. The selectivity filter contains two K+ ions about 7.5 angstroms apart. This configuration promotes ion conduction by exploiting electrostatic repulsive forces to overcome attractive forces between K+ ions and the selectivity filter. The architecture of the pore establishes the physical principles underlying selective K+ conduction.

9305996|a|Members of the rat brain Kv1 family of cloned potassium channels are structurally highly homologous, but have diverse conductance and pharmacological characteristics. Here we present data on the effects of mutating residues K533 in the P-region and H471 in the S4-S5 linker of Kv1.4 to their equivalent residues in Kv1.1 and Kv1.6 on single-channel conductance and sensitivity to external tetraethylammonium cations (TEA+) and internal Mg2+. Exchange of residue K533 for its equivalent residue (Y) in Kv1.1 and Kv1.6 increased the single-channel conductance at both negative and positive potentials. This mutation is known to reduce the IC50 for external TEA+ from > 100 mM to 0.6 mM, almost identical to that for Kv1.1 (0.53 mM). We have now found that the additional exchange of residue H471 for the equivalent residue (K) in Kv1.6 increased the IC50 for external TEA+ from 0.6 mM (Kv1.4K533Y) to 2.39 mM; this is very close to that for wild-type Kv1.6 channels (2.84 mM). The mutation H471K alone was ineffective. We thus provide evidence that the S4-S5 linker does contribute to the channel's inner-pore region. Data on the block of Kv1 channels by internal Mg2+ indicate that while the binding site is probably situated within the deep-pore region, its exact location may be channel specific.

1550673|a|K+ channels are quite variable in their sensitivity to the pore-blocking agent tetraethylammonium ion (TEA) when it is applied to the extracellular side of the membrane. A Shaker K+ channel can be made highly sensitive by introducing a tyrosine (or phenylalanine) at residue 449 in each of the four subunits. A shift in the voltage dependence of blockade indicates that TEA senses a smaller fraction of the transmembrane electric field in the highly sensitive channels. There is a linear relationship between the free energy for TEA blockade and the number of subunits (zero, two, or four) containing tyrosine at 449, as if these four residues interact simultaneously with a TEA molecule to produce a high affinity binding site. The temperature dependence of blockade suggests that the interaction is not purely hydrophobic. These findings are consistent with a TEA-binding site formed by a bracelet of pore-lining aromatic residues. The center of the bracelet could bind a TEA molecule through a cation-pi orbital interaction.

The delayed K currents can be totally abolished by TEA without affecting the transient Na currents or the leakage current in any way. Both inward and outward currents disappear. In low TEA concentrations small K currents remain with normal time constants. The dose-response relationship suggests the formation of a complex between TEA and a receptor with a dissociation constant of 0.4 mM. Other symmetrical quaternary ammonium ions have very little effect. There is no competition between TEA and agents that affect the Na currents such as Xylocaine, tetrodotoxin, or Ca ions. The pharmacological data demonstrate that the Na, K, and leakage permeabilities are chemically independent, probably because their mechanisms occupy different sites on the nodal membrane. The data are gathered and analyzed by digital computer.

722275|a|A literature review reveals many lines of evidence that both delayed rectifier and inward rectifier potassium channels are multi-ion pores. These include unidirectional flux ratios given by the 2--2.5 power of the electrochemical activity ratio, very steeply voltage-dependent block with monovalent blocking ions, relief of block by permeant ions added to the side opposite from the blocking ion, rectification depending on E--EK, and a minimum in the reversal potential or conductance as external K+ ions are replaced by an equivalent concentration of T1+ ions. We consider a channel with a linear sequence of energy barriers and binding sites. The channel can be occupied by more than one ion at a time, and ions hop in single file into vacant sites with rate constants that depend on barrier heights, membrane potential, and interionic repulsion. Such multi-ion models reproduce qualitatively the special flux properties of potassium channels when the barriers for hopping out of the pore are larger than for hopping between sites within the pore and when there is repulsion between ions. These conditions also produce multiple maxima in the conductance-ion activity relationship. In agreement with Armstrong's hypothesis (1969. J. Gen. Physiol. 54:553--575), inward rectification may be understood in terms of block by an internal blocking cation. Potassium channels must have at least three sites and often contain at least two ions at a time.

When expressed separately, they made homotetrameric channels that differed about 100-fold in sensitivity to tetraethylammonium (TEA). Mixtures of channels having one, two, or three low affinity subunits were expressed by injecting various proportions of RBK1 and RBK1* RNAs. The affinity for TEA of these three channel species was deduced by fitting concentration-response curves for the inhibition of potassium currents. DNAs were also concatenated to construct a sequence that encoded two connected subunits, and channels that contained four, two, or no TEA-sensitive subunits were expressed. The results suggest that bound TEA interacts simultaneously with all four subunits.

2019588|a|Extracellular tetraethylammonium (TEA) inhibits currents in Xenopus oocytes that have been injected with mRNAs encoding voltage-dependent potassium channels. Concentration-response curves were used to measure the affinity of TEA; this differed up to 700-fold among channels RBK1 (KD 0.3 mM), RGK5 (KD 11 mM), and RBK2 (KD greater than 200 mM). Studies in which chimeric channels were expressed localized TEA binding to the putative extracellular loop between trans-membrane domains S5 and S6. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in this region identified the residue Tyr379 of RBK1 as a crucial determinant of TEA sensitivity; substitution of Tyr in the equivalent positions of RBK2 (Val381) and RGK5 (His401) made these channels as sensitive to TEA as RBK1. Nonionic forces are involved in TEA binding because (i) substitution of the Phe for Tyr379 in RBK1 increased its affinity, (ii) protonation of His401 in RGK5 selectively reduced its affinity, and (iii) the affinity of TEA was unaffected by changes in ionic strength. The results suggest an explanation for the marked differences in TEA sensitivity that have been observed among naturally occurring and cloned potassium channels and indicate that the amino acid corresponding to residue 379 in RBK1 lies within the external mouth of the ion channel.

1928322|a|Tetraethylammonium (TEA) has been used recently to probe natural and mutational variants of voltage-dependent K+ channels encoded by cDNA clones. Its usefulness as a probe of channel structure prompted us to examine the molecular mechanism by which TEA blocks single-channel currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing the rat brain K+ channel, RCK2. TEA at the intracellular surface of membrane patches decreased channel open time and increased the duration of closed intervals. Tetrapentylammonium had similar but more potent effects. Extracellular application of TEA caused an apparent reduction of single-channel amplitude. Block was slower at the high-affinity internal site than at the low-affinity external site. Internal TEA selectively blocks open K+ channels, and the voltage dependence of the block indicates that the binding site lies within the membrane electric field at a point 25% of the distance from the cytoplasmic margin. External TEA also interacts with the open channel but is less sensitive to membrane potential. The results indicate that the internal and external TEA binding sites define the inner and outer margins of the aqueous pore.

Furthermore, the effects of the Y82V mutation are evaluated and the results show, in agreement with experimental data, that the mutant has a significantly reduced binding affinity for TEA at the external binding site, which is attributed to stabilising hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the tyrosines.

This physical process is central to the production of electrical signals in biology. Here we show how nearly diffusion-limited rates are achieved, by analysing ion conduction and the corresponding crystallographic ion distribution in the selectivity filter of the KcsA K+ channel. Measurements with K+ and its slightly larger analogue, Rb+, lead us to conclude that the selectivity filter usually contains two K+ ions separated by one water molecule. The two ions move in a concerted fashion between two configurations, K+-water-K+-water (1,3 configuration) and water-K+-water-K+ (2,4 configuration), until a third ion enters, displacing the ion on the opposite side of the queue. For K+, the energy difference between the 1,3 and 2,4 configurations is close to zero, the condition of maximum conduction rate. The energetic balance between these configurations is a clear example of evolutionary optimization of protein function.

10828250|a|We have examined the interaction between internal and external ions in the pore of potassium channels. We found that external tetraethylammonium was able to antagonize block of Shaker channels by internal TEA when the external and internal solutions contained K(+) ions. This antagonism was absent in solutions with Rb(+) as the only permeant ion. An externally applied trivalent TEA analogue, gallamine, was less effective than the monovalent TEA in inhibiting block by internal TEA. In addition, block by external TEA was little affected by changes in the concentration of internal K(+) ions, but was increased by the presence of internal Na(+) ions in the pore. These results demonstrate that external and internal TEA ions, likely located at opposite ends of the pore selectivity filter, do not experience a mutual electrostatic repulsion. We found that these results can be simulated by a simple 4-barrier-3-site permeation model in which ions compete for available binding sites without long-range electrostatic interactions.

11331347|a|We have examined the interaction between TEA and K+ ions in the pore of Shaker potassium channels. We found that the ability of external TEA to antagonize block of Shaker channels by internal TEA depended on internal K+ ions. In contrast, this antagonism was independent of external K+ concentrations between 0.2 and 40 mM. The external TEA antagonism of internal TEA block increased linearly with the concentration of internal K+ ions. In addition, block by external TEA was significantly enhanced by increases in the internal K+ concentration. These results suggested that external TEA ions do not directly antagonize internal TEA, but rather promote increased occupancy of an internal K+ site by inhibiting the emptying of that site to the external side of the pore. We found this mechanism to be quantitatively consistent with the results and revealed an intrinsic affinity of the site for K+ ions near 65 mM located approximately 7% into the membrane electric field from the internal end of the pore. We also found that the voltage dependence of block by internal TEA was influenced by internal K+ ions. The TEA site (at 0 internal K+) appeared to sense approximately 5% of the field from the internal end of the pore (essentially colocalized with the internal K+ site). These results lead to a refined picture of the number and location of ion binding sites at the inner end of the pore in Shaker K channels.

4541078|a|Increasing the hydrogen ion concentration of the bathing medium reversibly depresses the sodium permeability of voltage-clamped frog nerves. The depression depends on membrane voltage: changing from pH 7 to pH 5 causes a 60% reduction in sodium permeability at +20 mV, but only a 20% reduction at +180 mV. This voltage-dependent block of sodium channels by hydrogen ions is explained by assuming that hydrogen ions enter the open sodium channel and bind there, preventing sodium ion passage. The voltage dependence arises because the binding site is assumed to lie far enough across the membrane for bound ions to be affected by part of the potential difference across the membrane. Equations are derived for the general case where the blocking ion enters the channel from either side of the membrane. For H(+) ion blockage, a simpler model, in which H(+) enters the channel only from the bathing medium, is found to be sufficient. The dissociation constant of H(+) ions from the channel site, 3.9 x 10(-6) M (pK(a) 5.4), is like that of a carboxylic acid. From the voltage dependence of the block, this acid site is about one-quarter of the way across the membrane potential from the outside. In addition to blocking as described by the model, hydrogen ions also shift the responses of sodium channel "gates" to voltage, probably by altering the surface potential of the nerve. Evidence for voltage-dependent blockage by calcium ions is also presented.

2000494|a|The active site of voltage-activated potassium channels is a transmembrane aqueous pore that permits ions to permeate the cell membrane in a rapid yet highly selective manner. A useful probe for the pore of potassium-selective channels is the organic ion tetraethylammonium (TEA), which binds with millimolar affinity to the intracellular opening of the pore and blocks potassium current. In the potassium channel encoded by the Drosophila Shaker gene, an amino acid residue that specifically affects the affinity for intracellular TEA has now been identified by site-directed mutagenesis. This residue is in the middle of a conserved stretch of 18 amino acids that separates two locations that are both near the external opening of the pore. These findings suggest that this conserved region is intimately involved in the formation of the ion conduction pore of voltage-activated potassium channels. Further, a stretch of only eight amino acid residues must traverse 80 percent of the transmembrane electric potential difference.

10982405|a|The septins are a conserved family of proteins that are involved in cytokinesis and other aspects of cell-surface organization. In Drosophila melanogaster, null mutations in the pnut septin gene are recessive lethal, but homozygous pnut mutants complete embryogenesis and survive until the pupal stage. Because the completion of cellularization and other aspects of early development seemed likely to be due to maternally contributed Pnut product, we attempted to generate embryos lacking the maternal contribution in order to explore the roles of Pnut in these processes. We used two methods, the production of germline clones homozygous for a pnut mutation and the rescue of pnut homozygous mutant flies by a pnut(+) transgene under control of the hsp70 promoter. Remarkably, the pnut germline-clone females produced eggs, indicating that stem-cell and cystoblast divisions in the female germline do not require Pnut. Moreover, the Pnut-deficient embryos obtained by either method completed early syncytial development and began cellularization of the embryo normally. However, during the later stages of cellularization, the organization of the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge of the invaginating furrows became progressively more abnormal, and the embryos displayed widespread defects in cell and embryo morphology beginning at gastrulation. Examination of two other septins showed that Sep1 was not detectable at the cellularization front in the Pnut-deficient embryos, whereas Sep2 was still present in normal levels. Thus, it is possible that Sep2 (perhaps in conjunction with other septins such as Sep4 and Sep5) fulfills an essential septin role during the organization and initial ingression of the cellularization furrow even in the absence of Pnut and Sep1. Together, the results suggest that some cell-division events in Drosophila do not require septin function, that there is functional differentiation among the Drosophila septins, or both.

10811827|a|During mitosis in budding yeast the nucleus first moves to the mother-bud neck and then into the neck. Both movements depend on interactions of cytoplasmic microtubules with the cortex. We investigated the mechanism of these movements in living cells using video analysis of GFP-labeled microtubules in wild-type cells and in EB1 and Arp1 mutants, which are defective in the first and second steps, respectively. We found that nuclear movement to the neck is largely mediated by the capture of microtubule ends at one cortical region at the incipient bud site or bud tip, followed by microtubule depolymerization. Efficient microtubule interactions with the capture site require that microtubules be sufficiently long and dynamic to probe the cortex. In contrast, spindle movement into the neck is mediated by microtubule sliding along the bud cortex, which requires dynein and dynactin. Free microtubules can also slide along the cortex of both bud and mother. Capture/shrinkage of microtubule ends also contributes to nuclear movement into the neck and can serve as a backup mechanism to move the nucleus into the neck when microtubule sliding is impaired. Conversely, microtubule sliding can move the nucleus into the neck even when capture/shrinkage is impaired.

6935675|a|Tiny fragments from the cytoplasm of human skin fibroblasts with about 2% of the original cell volume ("microplasts") were prepared by treatment with cytochalasin B, vigorous pipetting, and trypsinization of the attached fragments. They remained alive for 8 hr or longer. Some of the microplasts were able to produce and move filopodia, ruffle, or both; others blebbed continuously. Slow flattening was observed in the larger microplasts. In all cases tested, microplasts avoided contact with other cells or microplasts. The observations suggest that the cytoplasmic matrix and the membranes of animal cells are so constructed as to express locally and autonomously any one of the elementary amoeboid movements listed above. More importantly, whatever types of motile surface projections a microplast expressed, it continued to produce and move them in a stereotypical way as if there were long-lived structural or material determinants for each type. The microplasts were unable to locomote autonomously. Therefore, it is conceivable that directional movement of whole cells may require a supervising mechanism that confers a certain coordination and strategy on its component cytoplasmic bits. Otherwise they would continue to move in stereotypical and autonomous ways without ever displacing themselves, as suggested by the behavior of the microplasts.

1518860|a|BHK cells were inoculated sparsely on one face ("sparse- or s-face") of a thin glass film whose opposite face was covered with a 2- to 3-day-old confluent layer of BHK cells ("confluent- or c-face"). After 7 hr of attaching and spreading in the absence of visible light, most of the cells on the s-face traversed with their long axes the direction of the whorls of the confluent cells on the c-face directly opposed. The effect was inhibited by a thin metal coating of the glass films. The results suggest that the cells were able to detect the orientation of others by signals that penetrated glass but not thin metallic films and, therefore, appeared to be carried by electromagnetic radiation. In contrast, the effect was not influenced by a thin coat of silicone on the glass, suggesting that the wavelength of this radiation is likely to be in the red to infrared range. The ability of cells to detect the direction of others by electromagnetic signals points to a rudimentary form of cellular "vision."

8020111|a|Previous experiments have suggested that 3T3 cells were able to extend pseudopodia toward latex particles up to 60 microns away from the cell body if the particles were irradiated by an infrared beam in the range of 700-900 nm [Albrecht-Buehler, 1991: J. Cell Biol. 114:493-502]. The present article reports that this response of cells to infrared light can be inhibited if the cell center is simultaneously irradiated with a beam of the same light. In marked contrast, the cells responded normally to the presence of infrared light scattering particles if the second beam irradiated other parts of the cell body. The results imply that the cellular mechanism of infrared detection is located at the cell center. The infrared sensing mechanism remains intact in enucleated cells and in cells which were incubated in monensin to vesiculate their Golgi apparatus and inhibit their Golgi functions. Accordingly, it is proposed that the centrosome which contains the centrioles is the only remaining candidate in the cell center for a cellular detection device for the direction of infrared signal sources. The results support an earlier suggestion that centrioles may be such detection devices [Albrecht-Buehler, 1981: Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton 1:237-245].

The assay measures the change of resistance to nocodazole of reconstituted cytoplasmic asters of irradiated cells. Using this assay on CV1 cells, I obtained results suggesting that pulsating near-infrared signals of 1 s pulse length reduced the stability of the radial microtubules around the centrosome. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the centrosome responded to the light by sending signals along its radial array of microtubules whose stability was then altered. The results may be an example of a more general function of the centrosome to integrate exogenous signals and send response signals along microtubules to various sites within the cell.

11746220|a|The genome is a stable repository of vastly intricate genetic information developed over eons of evolution; this information is replicated at the highest fidelity and expressed within each cell at the highest selectivity. Non-leukemia cancers break this standard; the intricate genetic information qualitatively and progressively deteriorates, resulting in a somatic Darwinian free-for-all. In a process lasting several years, a genomically heterogeneous population replicates from a single cell that originally lost the ability to preserve its genomic integrity. Cells selected for their abilities to proliferate and spread, while evading host defenses, inexorably expand their numbers. The clinical consequences of this become severe, as the genomically diverse cell population that evolves contains members that can evade most therapeutic approaches aimed at "the tumor cell".

12196915|a|The centromere is essential for the proper segregation and inheritance of genetic information. Neocentromeres are ectopic centromeres that originate occasionally from noncentromeric regions of chromosomes. Despite the complete absence of normal centromeric alpha-satellite DNA, human neocentromeres are able to form a primary constriction and assemble a functional kinetochore. Since the discovery and characterization of the first case of a human neocentromere in our laboratory a decade ago, 60 examples of constitutional human neocentromeres distributed widely across the genome have been described. Typically, these are located on marker chromosomes that have been detected in children with developmental delay or congenital abnormalities. Neocentromeres have also been detected in at least two types of human cancer and have been experimentally induced in Drosophila. Current evidence from human and fly studies indicates that neocentromere activity is acquired epigenetically rather than by any alteration to the DNA sequence. Since human neocentromere formation is generally detrimental to the individual, its biological value must lie beyond the individual level, such as in karyotype evolution and speciation.

12852855|a|The Ran GTPase is required for nuclear assembly, nuclear transport, spindle assembly, and mitotic regulation. While the first three processes are relatively well understood, details of Ran's role in mitotic progression remain obscure. We have found that elevated levels of Ran's exchange factor (RCC1) abrogate the spindle assembly checkpoint in Xenopus egg extracts, restore APC/C activity, and disrupt the kinetochore localization of checkpoint regulators, including Mad2, CENP-E, Bub1, and Bub3. Depletion of Ran's GTPase activating protein (RanGAP1) and its accessory factor (RanBP1) similarly abrogates checkpoint arrest. By contrast, the addition of RanGAP1 and RanBP1 to extracts with exogenous RCC1 restores the spindle checkpoint. Together, these observations suggest that the spindle checkpoint is directly responsive to Ran-GTP levels. Finally, we observe a clear wave of RCC1 association to mitotic chromosomes at the metaphase-anaphase transition in normal cycling extracts, suggesting that this mechanism has an important role in unperturbed cell cycles.

7790366|a|Relatively little is known about the mechanisms used by somatic cells to regulate the replication of the centrosome complex. Centrosome doubling was studied in CHO cells by electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy using human autoimmune anticentrosome antiserum, and by Northern blotting using the cDNA encoding portion of the centrosome autoantigen pericentriolar material (PCM)-1. Centrosome doubling could be dissociated from cycles of DNA synthesis and mitotic division by arresting cells at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle using either hydroxyurea or aphidicolin. Immunofluorescence micros-copy using SPJ human autoimmune anticentrosome antiserum demonstrated that arrested cells were able to undergo numerous rounds of centrosome replication in the absence of cycles of DNA synthesis and mitosis. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the synthesis and degradation of the mRNA encoding PCM-1 occurred in a cell cycle-dependent fashion in CHO cells with peak levels of PCM-1 mRNA being present in G1 and S phase cells before mRNA amounts dropped to undetectable levels in G2 and M phases. Conversely, cells arrested at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle maintained PCM-1 mRNA at artificially elevated levels, providing a possible molecular mechanism for explaining the multiple rounds of centrosome replication that occurred in CHO cells during prolonged hydroxyurea-induced arrest. The capacity to replicate centrosomes could be abolished in hydroxyurea-arrested CHO cells by culturing the cells in dialyzed serum. However, the ability to replicate centrosomes and to synthesize PCM-1 mRNA could be re-initiated by adding EGF to the dialyzed serum. This experimental system should be useful for investigating the positive and negative molecular mechanisms used by somatic cells to regulate the replication of centrosomes and for studying and the methods used by somatic cells for coordinating centrosome duplication with other cell cycle progression events.

8223701|a|Depolymerization of microtubules in metabolically inactive quiescent center (QC) cells of maize root apices by means of three different antimicrotubular treatments (colchicine, oryzalin and low temperature) elicited very similar responses in their nuclei. Conspicuous nuclear enlargement was closely associated with chromatin decondensation and accelerated traverse of their cell cycle. This latter finding was inferred not only from cytophotometry which showed an increased proportion of S and G2 nuclei in this group of cells, but also from autoradiography which confirmed the greater proportion of nuclei engaged in the S phase of the cell cycle. Activation of the QC cells with various antimicrotubular agents may be a reflection of a dependency of nuclear cell cycle events on the turnover of cytoplasmic microtubules during interphase. The nuclear size, nuclear chromatin structure, as well as cell cycle progression, seem to be regulated by the dynamic nature of the microtubular cytoskeleton.

9203357|a|The nucleus and the microtubular cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells appear to be structurally and functionally interrelated. Together they constitute a "cell body". One of the most important components of this body is a primary microtubule-organizing center (MTOC-I) located on or near the nuclear surface and composed of material that, in addition to constitutive centrosomal material, also comprises some nuclear matrix components. The MTOC-I shares a continuity with the mitotic spindle and, in animal cells, with the centrosome also. Secondary microtubule-organizing centers (MTOC-IIs) are a special feature of walled plant cells and are found at the plasma membrane where they organize arrays of cortical MTs that are essential for ordered cell wall synthesis and hence for cellular morphogenesis. MTOC-IIs are held to be similar in origin to the MTOC-I, but their material has been translocated to the cell periphery, perhaps by MTs organized and radiating from the MTOC-I. Many intranuclear, matrix-related components have been identified to participate in MT organization during mitosis and cytokinesis; some of them also seem to be related to the condensation and decondensation of chromatin during the mitotic chromosome cycle.

9429305|a|Direct contact of the radiating perinuclear microtubules (MTs) with the nuclear envelope was visualized with an immunogold technique using specific monoclonal tubulin antibody. The possibility that these perinuclear MT arrays are involved in establishing and maintaining nuclear organization during the interphase of cycling cells in maize root meristems was tested using taxol, a MT-stabilizing agent. Taxol not only stabilized all MTs against the action of the MT-disrupters colchicine and oryzalin but also prevented these agents from their usual induction of nuclear enlargement and decondensation of nuclear chromatin. On the contrary, nuclear size decreased and the chromatin became more compact in mitotically cycling cells of the taxol-treated root apices. Moreover, taxol prevented the stimulation, by colchicine and oryzalin, of the onset of the S phase in cells of the quiescent centre and proximal root meristem. Exposure of maize roots to taxol strongly decreased final cell volumes, suggesting that the more condensed nuclear chromatin is less efficient in genome expression and that this accounts for the restriction of cellular growth. All these findings support the hypothesis that MT arrays, radiating from the nuclear surface, are an essential part of an integrated plant 'cell body' consisting of nucleus and the MT cytoskeleton, and that they regulate, perhaps via their impact on chromatin condensation and activity, progress through the plant cell cycle.

11071779|a|Plant root hair formation is initiated when specialized elongating root epidermis cells (trichoblasts) assemble distinct domains at the plasma membrane/cell wall cell periphery complexes facing the root surface. These localities show accumulation of expansin and progressively transform into tip-growing root hair apices. Experimentation showed that trichoblasts made devoid of microtubules (MTs) were unaffected in root hair formation, whereas those depleted of F-actin by the G-actin sequestering agent latrunculin B had their root hair formation blocked after the bulge formation stage. In accordance with this, MTs are naturally depleted from early outgrowing bulges in which dense F-actin meshworks accumulate. These F-actin caps remain associated with tips of emerging and growing root hairs. Constitutive expression of the GFP-mouse talin fusion protein in transgenic Arabidopsis, which visualizes all classes of F-actin in a noninvasive mode, allowed in vivo confirmation of the presence of distinct F-actin meshworks within outgrowing bulges and at tips of young root hairs. Profilin accumulates, at both the protein and the mRNA levels, within F-actin-enriched bulges and at tips of emerging hairs. ER-based calreticulin and HDEL proteins also accumulate within outgrowing bulges and remain enriched at tips of emerging hairs. All this suggests that installation of the actin-based tip growth machinery takes place only after expansin-associated bulge formation and requires assembly of profilin-supported dynamic F-actin meshworks.

11239608|a|Analysis of the cytoskeleton in morphogenetically active plant cells allows us to propose a unified concept for the structural organization of eukaryotic cells. Their cytoarchitecture is determined by two principal structural complexes: nucleus-microtubule-based cell bodies ("bugs") and plasma-membrane-F-actin-based cell periphery complexes ("cages"). There are dynamic interactions between each of these entities in response to extracellular and intracellular signals. In the case of the cell body, these signals determine its polarization, rotation and migration. Interactions between cell body and cell periphery complexes determine cell growth polarity and morphogenesis throughout the eukaryotic kingdom.

11180956|a|Marine macrolides latrunculins are highly specific toxins which effectively depolymerize actin filaments (generally F-actin) in all eukaryotic cells. We show that latrunculin B is effective on diverse cell types in higher plants and describe the use of this drug in probing F-actin-dependent growth and in plant development-related processes. In contrast to other eukaryotic organisms, cell divisions occurs in plant cells devoid of all actin filaments. However, the alignment of the division planes is often distorted. In addition to cell division, postembryonic development and morphogenesis also continue in the absence of F-actin. These experimental data suggest that F-actin is of little importance in the morphogenesis of higher plants, and that plants can develop more or less normally without F-actin. In contrast, F-actin turns out to be essential for cell elongation. When latrunculin B was added during germination, morphologically normal Arabidopsis and rye seedlings developed but, as a result of the absence of cell elongation, these were stunted, resembling either genetic dwarfs or environmental bonsai plants. In conclusion, F-actin is essential for the plant cell elongation, while this F-actin-dependent cell elongation is not an essential feature of plant-specific developmental programs.

Auxin is a small molecule derived from the amino acid tryptophan and has both hormone- and morphogen-like properties. Although there is much still to be learned, recent progress has started to unveil how auxin is transported from cell-to-cell in a polar manner. Two recent breakthrough papers from Gerd Jürgens' group indicate that auxin transport is mediated by regulated vesicle trafficking, thus encompassing neurotransmitter-like features.

12766946|a|Polarity is an inherent feature of almost all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In most eukaryotic cells, growth polarity is due to the assembly of actin-based growing domains at particular locations on the cell periphery. A contrasting scenario is that growth polarity results from the establishment of non-growing domains, which are actively maintained at opposite end-poles of the cell. This latter mode of growth is common in rod-shaped bacteria and, surprisingly, also in the majority of plant cells, which elongate along the apical-basal axes of plant organs. The available data indicate that the non-growing end-pole domains of plant cells are sites of intense endocytosis and recycling. These actin-enriched end-poles serve also as signaling platforms, allowing bidirectional exchange of diverse signals along the supracellular domains of longitudinal cell files. It is proposed that these actively remodeled end-poles of elongating plant cells remotely resemble neuronal synapses.

12191014|a|Plant morphogenesis is regulated by cell division and expansion. Cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division, culminates in the construction of the cell plate, a unique cytokinetic membranous organelle that is assembled across the inside of the dividing cell. Both during cell-plate formation and cell expansion, the secretory pathway is highly active and is polarized toward the plane of division or toward the plasma membrane, respectively. In this review, we discuss results from recent genetic and biochemical research directed toward understanding the molecular events occurring during cytokinesis and cell expansion, including data supporting the idea that during cytokinesis one or more exocytic pathways are polarized toward the division plane. We will also highlight recent evidence for the roles of secretory vesicle transport and cytoskeletal machinery in cell-plate membrane trafficking and fusion.

12007411|a|A fundamental feature of development in the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis is the switch from medial to asymmetric division. The switch is brought about by a change in the location of the cytokinetic Z ring, which is composed of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ, from the cell middle to the poles during sporulation. We report that the medial Z ring is replaced by a spiral-like filament of FtsZ that grows along the long axis of the cell. We propose that the filament mediates the switch by redeploying FtsZ to the poles. Spiral formation and the switch to polar Z rings are largely caused by a sporulation-specific increase in transcription of the gene for FtsZ and activation of the gene for the FtsZ-associated protein SpoIIE.

14696040|a|The photosynthetic organelle of algae and plants (the plastid) traces its origin to a primary endosymbiotic event in which a previously non-photosynthetic protist engulfed and enslaved a cyanobacterium. This eukaryote then gave rise to the red, green and glaucophyte algae. However, many algal lineages, such as the chlorophyll c-containing chromists, have a more complicated evolutionary history involving a secondary endosymbiotic event, in which a protist engulfed an existing eukaryotic alga (in this case, a red alga). Chromists such as diatoms and kelps then rose to great importance in aquatic habitats. Another algal group, the dinoflagellates, has undergone tertiary (engulfment of a secondary plastid) and even quaternary endosymbioses. In this review, we examine algal diversity and show endosymbiosis to be a major force in algal evolution. This area of research has advanced rapidly and long-standing issues such as the chromalveolate hypothesis and the extent of endosymbiotic gene transfer have recently been clarified.

9732290|a|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mother cell and bud are connected by a narrow neck. The mechanism by which this neck is closed during cytokinesis has been unclear. Here we report on the role of a contractile actomyosin ring in this process. Myo1p (the only type II myosin in S. cerevisiae) forms a ring at the presumptive bud site shortly before bud emergence. Myo1p ring formation depends on the septins but not on F-actin, and preexisting Myo1p rings are stable when F-actin is depolymerized. The Myo1p ring remains in the mother-bud neck until the end of anaphase, when a ring of F-actin forms in association with it. The actomyosin ring then contracts to a point and disappears. In the absence of F-actin, the Myo1p ring does not contract. After ring contraction, cortical actin patches congregate at the mother-bud neck, and septum formation and cell separation rapidly ensue. Strains deleted for MYO1 are viable; they fail to form the actin ring but show apparently normal congregation of actin patches at the neck. Some myo1Delta strains divide nearly as efficiently as wild type; other myo1Delta strains divide less efficiently, but it is unclear whether the primary defect is in cytokinesis, septum formation, or cell separation. Even cells lacking F-actin can divide, although in this case division is considerably delayed. Thus, the contractile actomyosin ring is not essential for cytokinesis in S. cerevisiae. In its absence, cytokinesis can still be completed by a process (possibly localized cell-wall synthesis leading to septum formation) that appears to require septin function and to be facilitated by F-actin.

10230063|a|The polarized growth of cells as diverse as fungal hyphae, pollen tubes, algal rhizoids and root hairs is characterized by a highly localized regulation of cell expansion confined to the growing tip. In apically growing plant cells, a tip-focused [Ca2+]c gradient and the cytoskeleton have been associated with growth. Although actin has been established to be essential for the maintenance of elongation, the role of microtubules remains unclear. To address whether the microtubule cytoskeleton is involved in root hair growth and orientation, we applied microtubule antagonists to root hairs of Arabidopsis. In this report, we show that depolymerizing or stabilizing the microtubule cytoskeleton of these apically growing root hairs led to a loss of directionality of growth and the formation of multiple, independent growth points in a single root hair. Each growing point contained a tip-focused gradient of [Ca2+]c. Experimental generation of a new [Ca2+]c gradient in root hairs pre-treated with microtubule antagonists, using the caged-calcium ionophore Br-A23187, was capable of inducing the formation of a new growth point at the site of elevated calcium influx. These data indicate a role for microtubules in regulating the directionality and stability of apical growth in root hairs. In addition, these results suggest that the action of the microtubules may be mediated through interactions with the cellular machinery that maintains the [Ca2+]c gradient at the tip.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, anti-centrin antibodies were localized to the developing cell plate of onion and cauliflower root tip cells. In cauliflower florets, these antibodies localized to the walls in a punctate manner, consistent with the distribution of plasmodesmata as shown by colocalization with callose. Anti-centrin antibodies were localized to plasmodesmata of onion root tips and cauliflower florets with immunogold electron microscopy. Furthermore, this label was concentrated around the necks of plasmodesmata. In contrast, an antibody against calmodulin, which is a closely related calcium-binding protein, did not label plasmodesmata. We propose that centrin is a component of calcium-sensitive contractile nanofilaments in the neck region of plasmodesmata and facilitates the calcium-induced regulation of intercellular transport.

A fusion of the transmembrane domain (signal anchor sequence) of a rat sialyl transferase to GFP was targeted to the Golgi stacks. A second construct that expressed the Arabidopsis H/KDEL receptor homologue aERD2, fused to GFP, was targeted to both the Golgi apparatus and ER, allowing the relationship between these two organelles to be studied in living cells for the first time. The Golgi stacks were shown to move rapidly and extensively along the polygonal cortical ER network of leaf epidermal cells, without departing from the ER tubules. Co-localization of F-actin in the GFP-expressing cells revealed an underlying actin cytoskeleton that matched precisely the architecture of the ER network, while treatment of cells with the inhibitors cytochalasin D and N-ethylmaleimide revealed the dependency of Golgi movement on actin cables. These observations suggest that the leaf Golgi complex functions as a motile system of actin-directed stacks whose function is to pick up products from a relatively stationary ER system. Also, we demonstrate for the first time in vivo brefeldin A-induced retrograde transport of Golgi membrane protein to the ER.

11251092|a|During early seed development, nuclear divisions in the endosperm are not followed by cell division, leading to the development of a syncytium. The simple organization of the Arabidopsis endosperm provides a model in which to study the regulation of the cell cycle in relation to development. To monitor nuclear divisions, we constructed a HISTONE 2B::YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN gene fusion (H2B::YFP). To validate its use as a vital marker for chromatin in plants, H2B::YFP was expressed constitutively in Arabidopsis. This enabled the observation of mitoses in living root meristems. H2B::YFP was expressed specifically in Arabidopsis syncytial endosperm by using GAL4 transactivation. Monitoring mitotic activity in living syncytial endosperm showed that the syncytium was organized into three domains in which nuclei divide simultaneously with a specific time course. Each mitotic domain has a distinct spatiotemporal pattern of mitotic CYCLIN B1;1 accumulation. The polar spatial organization of the three mitotic domains suggests interactions between developmental mechanisms and the regulation of the cell cycle.

The interactions between CTLs and target can be very brief; nevertheless, adhesion and signaling proteins segregate into an immunological synapse. Secretion occurs in a specialized secretory domain. Use of live and fixed cell microscopy allows this secretory synapse to be visualized both temporally and spatially. The combined use of confocal and electron microscopy has produced some surprising findings, which suggest that the secretory synapse may be important both in delivering the lethal hit and in facilitating membrane transfer from target to CTL. Studies on the secretory synapse in wild-type and mutant CTLs have been used to identify proteins involved in secretion. Further clues as to the signals required for secretion are emerging from comparisons of inhibitory and activating synapses formed by natural killer cells.

Here, we examine in tobacco leaves the structural relationship between Golgi and ER membranes using electron microscopy and demonstrate that Golgi membranes contain elements that are in close association and/or in direct contact with the ER. We further visualized protein trafficking between the ER and the Golgi using Golgi marker proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein. Using photobleaching techniques, we showed that Golgi membrane markers constitutively cycle to and from the Golgi in an energy-dependent and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive manner. We found that membrane protein transport toward the Golgi occurs independently of the cytoskeleton and does not require the Golgi to be motile along the surface of the ER. Brefeldin A treatment blocked forward trafficking of Golgi proteins before their redistribution into the ER. Our results indicate that in plant cells, the Golgi apparatus is a dynamic membrane system whose components continuously traffic via membrane trafficking pathways regulated by brefeldin A- and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive machinery.

11146294|a|Aneuploid tumor cells can arise through multipolar mitosis caused by supernumerary centrosomes. Multipolar spindles, however, are antagonistic to cell viability. Thus, most cells derived from such an aberrant mitosis would be eliminated by apoptosis. A rare daughter cell, through chance acquisition of an appropriate chromosome complement and/or gene dosage, could survive and contribute to a clone of aneuploid tumor cells. Survival and perpetuation of the clone, however, requires an additional step - the resumption of mitotic stability through the assembly of a bipolar, not multipolar, spindle. Either selective inactivation of the extra centrosomes or their coalescence into two functional spindle poles corrects the problem of centrosome excess. Current data support coalescence as a mechanism for regulating the number of functional centrosomes in tumor cells.

14630951|a|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major viral cause of serious lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children worldwide. RSV infection is limited to the superficial layers of the respiratory epithelium in immunocompetent individuals. Consistent with this in vivo observation, we and others have found that RSV buds preferentially from the apical surface of infected polarized epithelial cells. In contrast, directional budding is not observed in nonpolarized human epithelial cells. These findings suggest that RSV uses specific cellular trafficking pathways to accomplish viral replication. The host cell proteins that regulate directional budding of RSV are undefined. Apical sorting of cellular proteins in polarized epithelial cells involves the apical recycling endosome (ARE). To investigate whether ARE-mediated protein sorting plays a role during RSV replication, we expressed a fragment of the myosin Vb tail that functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of ARE-mediated protein sorting in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. When these cells were infected with RSV, a >9,000-fold reduction in viral yield was observed. A similar effect on virus replication was observed when a carboxyl-terminal fragment of another ARE-associated protein, the Rab11 family interacting protein 1, was expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. These data suggest that RSV requires proper ARE-mediated protein sorting for efficient egress from the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells.

11732063|a|One of the intriguing aspects of development in plants is the precise control of division plane and subsequent placement of walls resulting in the specific architecture of tissues and organs. The placement of walls can be directed by either of two microtubule cycles. The better known microtubule cycle is associated with control of the future division plane in meristematic growth where new cells become part of tissues. The future daughter domains are determined before the nucleus enters prophase and the future site of cytokinesis is marked by a preprophase band (PPB) of cortical microtubules. The spindle axis is then organized in accordance with the PPB and, following chromosome movement, a phragmoplast is initiated in the interzone and expands to join with parental walls at the site previously occupied by the PPB. The alternative microtubule cycle lacks both the hooplike cortical microtubules of interphase and the PPB. Wall placement is determined by a radial microtubule system that defines a domain of cytoplasm either containing a nucleus or destined to contain a nucleus (the nuclear cytoplasmic domain) and controls wall placement at its perimeter. This more flexible system allows for cytoplasmic polarization and migration of nuclei in coenocytes prior to cellularization. The uncoupling of cytokinesis from karyokinesis is a regular feature of the reproductive phase in plants and results in specific, often unusual, patterns of cells which reflect the position of nuclei at the time of cellularization (e.g., the arrangement of spores in a tetrad, cells of the male and female gametophytes of angiosperms, and the distinctive cellularization of endosperm). Thus, both microtubule cycles are required for completion of plant life cycles from bryophytes to angiosperms. In angiosperm seed development, the two methods of determining the boundaries of domains where walls will be deposited are operative side by side. Whereas the PPB cycle drives embryo development, the radial-microtubule-system cycle drives the common nuclear type of endosperm development from the syncytial stage through cellularization. However, a switch to the PPB cycle can occur in endosperm, as it does in barley, when peripheral cells divide to produce a multilayered aleurone. The triggers for the switch between microtubule cycles, which are currently unknown, are key to understanding plant development.

12244271|a|An immunofluorescence study of sectioned barley endosperm imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy provided three-dimensional data on the relationship of microtubules to the cytoplasm, nuclei, and cell walls during development from 4 to 21 days after pollination (DAP). Microtubules play an important role throughout endosperm ontogeny. The syncytium is organized into units of nuclear-cytoplasmic domains by nuclear-based radial microtubule systems that appear to control the pattern of the first anticlinal walls at 5 to 6 DAP. After 7 DAP, phragmoplasts of two origins (interzonal and cytoplasmic) guide wall formation. Large compartments formed by the "free growing" walls in association with cytoplasmic phragmoplasts formed adventitiously at interfaces of opposing microtubule systems are subsequently subdivided by interzonal phragmoplast/cell plates to give rise to the starchy endosperm. During development of the aleurone layer from 8 to 21 DAP, the microtubule cycle is typical of plant histogenesis; cortical microtubules are hooplike, and preprophase bands of microtubules predict the division plane.

14714205|a|Endosperm begins development as a single fertilized cell that undergoes many rounds of mitosis without cytokinesis resulting in a syncytium. The multinucleate cytoplasm is organized by nucleus-based radial microtubule systems into nuclear-cytoplasmic domains. When microtubules are organized into mitotic spindles, the integrity of the common cytoplasm is maintained by an unaltered network of filamentous actin. The first four rounds of mitosis result in the establishment of three developmental domains within the common cytoplasm. The spindles of the first two rounds of mitosis are oriented parallel to the long axis of the central cell, resulting in four nuclear-cytoplasmic domains in a filamentous arrangement. A switch in spindle orientation occurs in the third round of mitosis; all four spindles are oriented perpendicular to the long axis resulting in eight nuclear-cytoplasmic domains arranged in two adjacent files. Whereas the first three rounds of mitosis are synchronous, the fourth occurs as a wave of successive mitoses that begins at the micropylar pole. By the 16-nuclei stage, differences in nuclear shape, cytoskeletal arrays, and cytoplasmic characteristics mark the differentiation of the syncytium into micropylar, central, and chalazal developmental chambers. Nuclei in the micropylar chamber are fusiform and sheathed by parallel microtubules that flare from their tips, while those in the central and chalazal chambers are spherical. Nuclei in the central chamber are surrounded by radial microtubule systems, while those in the chalaza are enmeshed in a reticulum of microtubules. Whereas the cytoplasm in both micropylar and chalazal chambers is dense and nearly nonvacuolate, the syncytium in the central chamber consists of a single layer of evenly spaced nuclear-cytoplasmic domains surrounding a large central vacuole.

12813146|a|We present here a new technique with which to visualize nuclei in living muscle fibres in the intact animal, involving injection of labelled DNA into single cells. This approach allowed us to determine the position of all of nuclei within a sarcolemma without labelling satellite cells. In contrast to what has been reported in tissue culture, we found that the nuclei were immobile, even when observed over several days. Nucleic density was uniform along the fibre except for the endplate and some myotendinous junctions, where the density was higher. The perijunctional region had the same number of nuclei as the rest of the fibre. In the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, the extrajunctional nuclei were elongated and precisely aligned to the long axis of the fibre. In the soleus, the nuclei were rounder and not well aligned. When comparing small and large fibres in the soleus, the number of nuclei varied approximately in proportion to cytoplasmic volume, while in the EDL the number was proportional to surface area. Statistical analysis revealed that the nuclei were not randomly distributed in either the EDL or the soleus. For each fibre, actual distributions were compared with computer simulations in which nuclei were assumed to repel each other, which optimizes the distribution of nuclei with respect to minimizing transport distances. The simulated patterns were regular, with clear row-like structures when the density of nuclei was low. The non-random and often row-like distribution of nuclei observed in muscle fibres may thus reflect regulatory mechanisms whereby nuclei repel each other in order to minimize transport distances.

12975343|a|The position of the centrosome is actively maintained at the cell center, but the mechanisms of the centering force remain largely unknown. It is known that centrosome positioning requires a radial array of cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs) that can exert pushing or pulling forces involving MT dynamics and the activity of cortical MT motors. It has also been suggested that actomyosin can play a direct or indirect role in this process. To examine the centering mechanisms, we introduced an imbalance of forces acting on the centrosome by local application of an inhibitor of MT assembly (nocodazole), and studied the resulting centrosome displacement. Using this approach in combination with microinjection of function-blocking probes, we found that a MT-dependent dynein pulling force plays a key role in the positioning of the centrosome at the cell center, and that other forces applied to the centrosomal MTs, including actomyosin contractility, can contribute to this process.

9714769|a|The intimate association between the Golgi complex and the microtubule cytoskeleton plays an important role in Golgi structure and function. Recent evidence indicates that the dynamic flow of material from the ER to the Golgi is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the Golgi complex and its characteristic location within the cell, and it is now clear that this flow is dependent on the ongoing activity of microtubule motor proteins. This review focuses primarily on recent microinjection and expression studies which have explored the role of individual microtubule motor proteins in controlling Golgi dynamics. The collective evidence shows that one or more isoforms of cytoplasmic dynein, together with its cofactor the dynactin complex, are required to maintain a juxtanuclear Golgi complex in fibroblasts. Although questions remain about how dynein and dynactin are linked to the Golgi, there is evidence that the Golgi-spectrin lattice is involved. Kinesin and kinesin-like proteins appear to play a smaller role in Golgi dynamics, though this may be very cell-type specific. Moreover, new evidence about the role of kinesin family members continues to emerge. Thanks in part to recent advances in our understanding of these molecular motors, our current view of the Golgi complex is of an organelle in flux, undergoing constant renewal. Future research will be aimed at elucidating how and to what extent these motor proteins function as regulators of Golgi function.

10842376|a|The assembly of the higher plant cytoskeleton poses several fundamental questions. Since different microtubule arrays are successively assembled during the cell cycle in the absence of centrosomes, we can ask how these arrays are assembled and spatially organized. Two hypotheses are under debate. Either multiple nucleation sites are responsible for the assembly and organization of microtubule arrays or microtubule nucleation takes place at one site, the nuclear surface. In the latter case, microtubule nucleation and organization would be two distinct but coregulated processes. During recent years, novel approaches have provided entirely new insights to understand the assembly and dynamics of the plant cytoskeleton. In the present review, we summarize advances made in microscopy and in molecular biology which lead to novel hypotheses and open up new fields of investigation. From the results obtained, it is clear that the higher plant cell is a powerful model system to investigate cytoskeletal organization in acentrosomal eukaryotic cells.

10408446|a|Chromosomes are segregated by two antiparallel arrays of microtubules arranged to form the spindle apparatus. During cell division, the nucleation of cytosolic microtubules is prevented and spindle microtubules nucleate from centrosomes (in mitotic animal cells) or around chromosomes (in plants and some meiotic cells). The molecular mechanism by which chromosomes induce local microtubule nucleation in the absence of centrosomes is unknown, but it can be studied by adding chromatin beads to Xenopus egg extracts. The beads nucleate microtubules that eventually reorganize into a bipolar spindle. RCC1, the guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor for the GTPase protein Ran, is a component of chromatin. Using the chromatin bead assay, we show here that the activity of chromosome-associated RCC1 protein is required for spindle formation. Ran itself, when in the GTP-bound state (Ran-GTP), induces microtubule nucleation and spindle-like structures in M-phase extract. We propose that RCC1 generates a high local concentration of Ran-GTP around chromatin which in turn induces the local nucleation of microtubules.

A functional GFP-Mbl fusion protein was used to examine the behavior of the helical cables formed by Mbl protein in live B. subtilis cells. The cables undergo dynamic changes during cell cycle progression. They are stable but not rigid while elongating in parallel with cell growth, and they require septum formation to divide/cleave. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis showed that the cables are continuously remodeled during cell elongation. Turnover occurs along the length of the helical Mbl filaments, with no obvious polarity and a recovery half-time of about 8 min. These findings have important implications for the nature of bacterial cell wall architecture and synthesis.

9670007|a|Measles viruses (MV) can be isolated from the brains of deceased subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients only in a cell-associated form. These viruses are often defective in the matrix (M) protein and always seem to have an altered fusion protein cytoplasmic tail. We reconstituted a cell-free, infectious M-less MV (MV-DeltaM) from cDNA. In comparison with standard MV, MV-DeltaM was considerably more efficient at inducing cell-to-cell fusion but virus titres were reduced approximately 250-fold. In MV-DeltaM-induced syncytia the ribonucleocapsids and glycoproteins largely lost co-localization, confirming the role of M protein as the virus assembly organizer. Genetically modified mice were inoculated with MV-DeltaM or with another highly fusogenic virus bearing glycoproteins with shortened cytoplasmic tails (MV-Delta(tails)). MV-DeltaM and MV-Delta(tails) lost acute pathogenicity but penetrated more deeply into the brain parenchyma than standard MV. We suggest that enhanced cell fusion may also favour the propagation of mutated, assembly-defective MV in human brains.

11931142|a|Eukaryotes and archaebacteria form the clade neomura and are sisters, as shown decisively by genes fragmented only in archaebacteria and by many sequence trees. This sisterhood refutes all theories that eukaryotes originated by merging an archaebacterium and an alpha-proteobacterium, which also fail to account for numerous features shared specifically by eukaryotes and actinobacteria. I revise the phagotrophy theory of eukaryote origins by arguing that the essentially autogenous origins of most eukaryotic cell properties (phagotrophy, endomembrane system including peroxisomes, cytoskeleton, nucleus, mitosis and sex) partially overlapped and were synergistic with the symbiogenetic origin of mitochondria from an alpha-proteobacterium. These radical innovations occurred in a derivative of the neomuran common ancestor, which itself had evolved immediately prior to the divergence of eukaryotes and archaebacteria by drastic alterations to its eubacterial ancestor, an actinobacterial posibacterium able to make sterols, by replacing murein peptidoglycan by N-linked glycoproteins and a multitude of other shared neomuran novelties. The conversion of the rigid neomuran wall into a flexible surface coat and the associated origin of phagotrophy were instrumental in the evolution of the endomembrane system, cytoskeleton, nuclear organization and division and sexual life-cycles. Cilia evolved not by symbiogenesis but by autogenous specialization of the cytoskeleton. I argue that the ancestral eukaryote was uniciliate with a single centriole (unikont) and a simple centrosomal cone of microtubules, as in the aerobic amoebozoan zooflagellate Phalansterium. I infer the root of the eukaryote tree at the divergence between opisthokonts (animals, Choanozoa, fungi) with a single posterior cilium and all other eukaryotes, designated 'anterokonts' because of the ancestral presence of an anterior cilium. Anterokonts comprise the Amoebozoa, which may be ancestrally unikont, and a vast ancestrally biciliate clade, named 'bikonts'. The apparently conflicting rRNA and protein trees can be reconciled with each other and this ultrastructural interpretation if long-branch distortions, some mechanistically explicable, are allowed for. Bikonts comprise two groups: corticoflagellates, with a younger anterior cilium, no centrosomal cone and ancestrally a semi-rigid cell cortex with a microtubular band on either side of the posterior mature centriole; and Rhizaria [a new infrakingdom comprising Cercozoa (now including Ascetosporea classis nov.), Retaria phylum nov., Heliozoa and Apusozoa phylum nov.], having a centrosomal cone or radiating microtubules and two microtubular roots and a soft surface, frequently with reticulopodia. Corticoflagellates comprise photokaryotes (Plantae and chromalveolates, both ancestrally with cortical alveoli) and Excavata (a new protozoan infrakingdom comprising Loukozoa, Discicristata and Archezoa, ancestrally with three microtubular roots). All basal eukaryotic radiations were of mitochondrial aerobes; hydrogenosomes evolved polyphyletically from mitochondria long afterwards, the persistence of their double envelope long after their genomes disappeared being a striking instance of membrane heredity. I discuss the relationship between the 13 protozoan phyla recognized here and revise higher protozoan classification by updating as subkingdoms Lankester's 1878 division of Protozoa into Corticata (Excavata, Alveolata; with prominent cortical microtubules and ancestrally localized cytostome--the Parabasalia probably secondarily internalized the cytoskeleton) and Gymnomyxa [infrakingdoms Sarcomastigota (Choanozoa, Amoebozoa) and Rhizaria; both ancestrally with a non-cortical cytoskeleton of radiating singlet microtubules and a relatively soft cell surface with diffused feeding]. As the eukaryote root almost certainly lies within Gymnomyxa, probably among the Sarcomastigota, Corticata are derived. Following the single symbiogenetic origin of chloroplasts in a corticoflagellate host with cortical alveoli, this ancestral plant radiated rapidly into glaucophytes, green plants and red algae. Secondary symbiogeneses subsequently transferred plastids laterally into different hosts, making yet more complex cell chimaeras--probably only thrice: from a red alga to the corticoflagellate ancestor of chromalveolates (Chromista plus Alveolata), from green algae to a secondarily uniciliate cercozoan to form chlorarachneans and independently to a biciliate excavate to yield photosynthetic euglenoids. Tertiary symbiogenesis involving eukaryotic algal symbionts replaced peridinin-containing plastids in two or three dinoflagellate lineages, but yielded no major novel groups. The origin and well-resolved primary bifurcation of eukaryotes probably occurred in the Cryogenian Period, about 850 million years ago, much more recently than suggested by unwarranted backward extrapolations of molecular 'clocks' or dubious interpretations as 'eukaryotic' of earlier large microbial fossils or still more ancient steranes. The origin of chloroplasts and the symbiogenetic incorporation of a red alga into a corticoflagellate to create chromalveolates may both have occurred in a big bang after the Varangerian snowball Earth melted about 580 million years ago, thereby stimulating the ensuing Cambrian explosion of animals and protists in the form of simultaneous, poorly resolved opisthokont and anterokont radiations.

10710706|a|DNA can be divided functionally into three categories: (1) genes--which code for proteins or specify non-messenger RNAs; (2) semons--short specific sequences involved in the replication, segregation, recombination or specific attachments of chromosomes, or chromosome regions (e.g. loops or domains) or selfish genetic elements; (3) secondary DNA--which does not function by means of specific sequences. Probably more than 90% of DNA in the biosphere is secondary DNA present in the nuclei of plants and phytoplankton. The amount of genic DNA is related to the complexity of the organism, whereas the amount of secondary DNA increases proportionally with cell volume, and not with complexity. This correlation is most simply explained by the skeletal DNA hypothesis, according to which nuclear DNA functions as the basic framework for the assembly of the nucleus and the total genomic DNA content functions (together with relatively invariant folding rules) in determining nuclear volumes. Balanced growth during the cell cycle requires the cytonuclear ratio to be basically constant, irrespective of cell volume; thus nuclear volumes, and therefore the overall genome size, have to be evolutionarily adjusted to changing cell volumes for optimal function. Bacteria, mitochondria, chloroplasts and viruses have no nuclear envelope; and the skeletal DNA hypothesis simply explains why secondary DNA is essentially absent from them but present in large cell nuclei. Hitherto it has been difficult to refute the alternative hypothesis that nuclear secondary DNA (whether 'junk' or selfish DNA) accumulates merely by mutation pressure, and that selection for economy is not strong enough to eliminate it, whereas accumulation in mitochondria and plastids is prevented by intracellular replicative competition between their multiple genomes. New data that discriminate clearly between these explanations for secondary DNA come from cryptomonads and chlorarachneans, two groups of algae that originated independently by secondary symbiogenesis (i.e., the merger of two radically different eukaryote cells) several hundred million years ago. In both groups the nucleus and plasma membrane of the former algal symbiont persist as the nucleomorphs and periplastid membrane, respectively. The fact that nucleomorphs have undergone a 200- to 1000-fold reduction in genome size and have virtually no secondary DNA shows that selection against non-functional nuclear DNA is strong enough to eliminate it very efficiently; therefore, the large amounts of secondary DNA in the former host nuclei of these chimaeras, and in nuclei generally, must be being maintained by positive selection. The divergent selection for secondary DNA in the nucleus and against it in nucleomorphs is readily explicable by the skeletal DNA hypothesis, given the different spectrum of gene functions that it encodes.

With the use of nocodazole wash-out experiments in hepatic cells, we found that the occurrence of noncentrosomal, early stabilized microtubules is highly correlated with the subcellular localization of Golgi membranes. With the use of in vitro reconstituted microtubule assembly systems with or without cytosol, we also found that, in contrast to centrosomally attached microtubules, the distal ends of Golgi-attached microtubules are remotely stabilized in a way that requires additional cytosolic component(s). Finally, we demonstrate that Golgi-based microtubule nucleation is direct and involves a subset of gamma-tubulin bound to the cytoplasmic face of the organelle.

In Arabidopsis thaliana cells, expression of a fusion between the microtubule-end-binding protein AtEB1a and green fluorescent protein (GFP) results in labelling of spindle poles, where minus ends gather. During interphase, AtEB1a-GFP labels the microtubule plus end as a comet, but also marks the minus end as a site from which microtubules can grow and shrink. These minus-end nucleation sites are mobile, explaining how the cortical array can redistribute during the cell cycle and supporting the idea of a flexible centrosome in plants.

14505574|a|Myoblast fusion is essential for the formation and regeneration of skeletal muscle. In a genetic screen for regulators of muscle development in Drosophila, we discovered a gene encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, called loner, which is required for myoblast fusion. Loner localizes to subcellular sites of fusion and acts downstream of cell surface fusion receptors by recruiting the small GTPase ARF6 and stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange. Accordingly, a dominant-negative ARF6 disrupts myoblast fusion in Drosophila embryos and in mammalian myoblasts in culture, mimicking the fusion defects caused by loss of Loner. Loner and ARF6, which also control the proper membrane localization of another small GTPase, Rac, are key components of a cellular apparatus required for myoblast fusion and muscle development. In muscle cells, this fusigenic mechanism is coupled to fusion receptors; in other fusion-competent cell types it may be triggered by different upstream signals.

Here we characterize an HPS2 mutation and demonstrate that AP-3 deficiency leads to a loss of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated cytotoxicity. Although the lysosomal protein CD63 was mislocalized to the plasma membrane, perforin and granzymes were correctly localized to the lytic granules in AP-3-deficient CTLs. However, the lytic granules of AP-3-deficient CTLs were enlarged and were unable to move along microtubules and dock within the secretory domain of the immunological synapse.

11732060|a|Tradescantia virginiana leaf epidermal cells were plasmolysed by sequential treatment with 0.8 M and 0.3 M sucrose. Plasmolysis revealed adhesion of the plasma membrane to the cell wall at sites coinciding with cytoskeletal arrays involved in the polarisation of cells undergoing asymmetric divisions--cortical actin patch--and in the establishment and maintenance of the division site--preprophase band of microtubules and filamentous (F) actin. The majority of cells retained adhesions at the actin patch throughout mitosis. However, only approximately 13% of cells formed or retained attachments at the site of the preprophase band. After the breakdown of the nuclear envelope, plasmolysis had a dramatic effect on spindle orientation, cell plate formation, and the plane of cytokinesis. Spindles were rotated at abnormal angles including tilted into the plane of the epidermis. Cell plates formed but were quickly replaced by vacuole-like intercellular compartments containing no Tinopal-stainable cell wall material. This compartment usually opened to the apoplast at one side, and cytokinesis was completed by the furrow extending across the protoplast. This atypical cytokinesis was facilitated by a phragmoplast containing microtubules and F-actin. Progression of the furrow was unaffected by 25 micrograms of cytochalasin B per ml but inhibited by 10 microM oryzalin. Phragmoplasts were contorted and misguided and cytokinesis prolonged, indicating severe disruption to the guidance mechanisms controlling phragmoplast expansion. These results are discussed in terms of cytoskeleton-plasma membrane-cell wall connections that could be important to the localisation of plasma membrane molecules defining the cortical division site and hence providing positional information to the cytokinetic apparatus, and/or for providing an anchor for cytoplasmic F-actin necessary to generate tension on the phragmoplast and facilitate its directed, planar expansion.

8730104|a|Microtubule disruption has dramatic effects on the normal centrosomal localization of the Golgi complex, with Golgi elements remaining as competent functional units but undergoing a reversible "fragmentation" and dispersal throughout the cytoplasm. In this study we have analyzed this process using digital fluorescence image processing microscopy combined with biochemical and ultrastructural approaches. After microtubule depolymerization, Golgi membrane components were found to redistribute to a distinct number of peripheral sites that were not randomly distributed, but corresponded to sites of protein exit from the ER. Whereas Golgi enzymes redistributed gradually over several hours to these peripheral sites, ERGIC-53 (a protein which constitutively cycles between the ER and Golgi) redistributed rapidly (within 15 minutes) to these sites after first moving through the ER. Prior to this redistribution, Golgi enzyme processing of proteins exported from the ER was inhibited and only returned to normal levels after Golgi enzymes redistributed to peripheral ER exit sites where Golgi stacks were regenerated. Experiments examining the effects of microtubule disruption on the membrane pathways connecting the ER and Golgi suggested their potential role in the dispersal process. Whereas clustering of peripheral pre-Golgi elements into the centrosomal region failed to occur after microtubule disruption, Golgi-to-ER membrane recycling was only slightly inhibited. Moreover, conditions that impeded Golgi-to-ER recycling completely blocked Golgi fragmentation. Based on these findings we propose that a slow but constitutive flux of Golgi resident proteins through the same ER/Golgi cycling pathways as ERGIC-53 underlies Golgi Dispersal upon microtubule depolymerization. Both ERGIC-53 and Golgi proteins would accumulate at peripheral ER exit sites due to failure of membranes at these sites to cluster into the centrosomal region. Regeneration of Golgi stacks at these peripheral sites would re-establish secretory flow from the ER into the Golgi complex and result in Golgi dispersal.

12809607|a|Cell shape in most eubacteria is maintained by a tough external peptidoglycan cell wall. Recently, cell shape determining proteins of the MreB family were shown to form helical, actin-like cables in the cell. We used a fluorescent derivative of the antibiotic vancomycin as a probe for nascent peptidoglycan synthesis in unfixed cells of various Gram-positive bacteria. In the rod-shaped bacterium B. subtilis, synthesis of the cylindrical part of the cell wall occurs in a helical pattern governed by an MreB homolog, Mbl. However, a few rod-shaped bacteria have no MreB system. Here, a rod-like shape can be achieved by a completely different mechanism based on use of polar growth zones derived from the division machinery. These results provide insights into the diverse molecular strategies used by bacteria to control their cellular morphology, as well as suggesting ways in which these strategies may impact on growth rates and cell envelope structure.

9843957|a|Early cleavages of Xenopus embryos were oriented in strong, static magnetic fields. Third-cleavage planes, normally horizontal, were seen to orient to a vertical plane parallel with a vertical magnetic field. Second cleavages, normally vertical, could also be oriented by applying a horizontal magnetic field. We argue that these changes in cleavage-furrow geometries result from changes in the orientation of the mitotic apparatus. We hypothesize that the magnetic field acts directly on the microtubules of the mitotic apparatus. Considerations of the length of the astral microtubules, their diamagnetic anisotropy, and flexural rigidity predict the required field strength for an effect that agrees with the data. This observation provides a clear example of a static magnetic-field effect on a fundamental cellular process, cell division.

14633972|a|Kinetochores are multiprotein complexes that assemble on centromeric DNA and attach chromosomes to spindle microtubules. Over the past six years, the number of proteins known to localize to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinetochore has increased from around 10 to over 60. However, relatively little is known about the protein-protein interactions that mediate kinetochore assembly or about the overall structure of microtubule-attachment sites. Here we used biophysical techniques, affinity purification, mass spectrometry, and in vivo assays to examine the state of association of 31 centromere-binding proteins, including six proteins newly identified as kinetochore subunits. We found that yeast kinetochores resemble transcriptional enhancers in being composed of at least 17 discrete subcomplexes that assemble on DNA to form a very large structure with a mass in excess of 5 MD. Critical to kinetochore assembly are proteins that bridge subunits in direct contact with DNA and subunits bound to microtubules. We show that two newly identified kinetochore complexes, COMA (Ctf19p-Okp1p-Mcm21p-Ame1p) and MIND (Mtw1p including Nnf1p-Nsl1p-Dsn1p) function as bridges. COMA, MIND, and the previously described Ndc80 complex constitute three independent and essential platforms onto which outer kinetochore proteins assemble. In addition, we propose that the three complexes have different functions with respect to force generation and MT attachment.

11334736|a|Gamma tubulin (gamma-tubulin) is involved in microtubule initiation in the eukaryotes. In animal cells it is localised to centrosomes and to other, non-centrosomal sites of microtubule initiation. In addition, cytoplasmic complexes containing gamma-tubulin (gamma-TuRCs; gamma-somes) have been described, which are multiprotein complexes involved in microtubule initiation. Most localisations of gamma-tubulin in plants have previously been achieved using an antibody directed towards a conserved peptide sequence found in animal cells, showing co-localisation with all microtubule arrays throughout the cell cycle. Because different antibodies may give various patterns of subcellular localisation, in the present study we raised a polyclonal antibody ('Hayley') to the plant peptide sequence EDFATQGGDRKDVFFY (bold letters indicate plant-specific amino acids) to further investigate the subcellular distribution in plants. Immunoblotting using wheat root tip protein extracts revealed a 58 kDagamma-tubulin-like peptide as has been described before. Immunofluorescence microscopy of wheat root-tip cells, however, revealed localisation of gamma-tubulin to a subset of mitotic microtubule arrays and the cytokinetic phragmoplast, but not to interphase cortical arrays or the preprophase band of microtubules. This lack of labelling may be caused by a restriction of antibody access during interphase, but more likely by a cell division-specific conformational change in the gamma-tubulin molecule. Our antibody also gave an organelle-like labelling, not described before, which may represent storage forms or precursors of gamma-tubulin, perhaps related to plastid-based microtubule initiation in hepatics and hornworts.

12840069|a|The Ran GTPase plays a central function in control of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport in interphase. Mitotic roles of Ran have also been firmly established in Xenopus oocyte extracts. In this system, Ran-GTP, or the RCC1 exchange factor for Ran, drive spindle assembly by regulating the availability of 'aster-promoting activities'. In previous studies to assess whether the Ran network also influences mitosis in mammalian cells, we found that overexpression of Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1), a major effector of Ran, induces multipolar spindles. We now show that these abnormal spindles are generated through loss of cohesion in mitotic centrosomes. Specifically, RanBP1 excess induces splitting of mother and daughter centrioles at spindle poles; the resulting split centrioles can individually organize functional microtubule arrays, giving rise to functional spindle poles. RanBP1-dependent centrosome splitting is specifically induced in mitosis and requires microtubule integrity and Eg5 activity. In addition, we have identified a fraction of RanBP1 at the centrosome. These data indicate that overexpressed RanBP1 interferes with crucial factor(s) that control structural and dynamic features of centrosomes during mitosis and contribute to uncover novel mitotic functions downstream of the Ran network.

12382325|a|Hypotheses on the origin of eukaryotic cells must account for the origin of the microtubular cytoskeletal structures (including the mitotic spindle, undulipodium/cilium (so-called flagellum) and other structures underlain by the 9(2)+2 microtubular axoneme) in addition to the membrane-bounded nucleus. Whereas bacteria with membrane-bounded nucleoids have been described, no precedent for mitotic, cytoskeletal, or axonemal microtubular structures are known in prokaryotes. Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate that the cells of the earliest-branching lineages of eukaryotes contain the karyomastigont cytoskeletal system. These protist cells divide via an extranuclear spindle and a persistent nuclear membrane. We suggest that this association between the centriole/kinetosome axoneme (undulipodium) and the nucleus existed from the earliest stage of eukaryotic cell evolution. We interpret the karyomastigont to be a legacy of the symbiosis between thermoacidophilic archaebacteria and motile eubacteria from which the first eukaryote evolved. Mutually inconsistent hypotheses for the origin of the nucleus are reviewed and sequenced proteins of cell motility are discussed because of their potential value in resolving this problem. A correlation of fossil evidence with modern cell and microbiological studies leads us to the karyomastigont theory of the origin of the nucleus.

9724962|a|Recent phylogenetic analyses reveal that many eukaryotic nuclear genes whose prokaryotic ancestry can be pinned down are of bacterial origin. Among them are genes whose products function exclusively in cytosolic metabolism. The results are surprising: we had come to believe that the eukaryotic nuclear genome shares a most recent common ancestor with archaeal genomes, thus most of its gene should be 'archaeal' (loosely speaking). Some genes of bacterial origin were expected as the result of transfer from mitochondria, of course, but these were thought to be relatively few, and limited to producing proteins reimported into mitochondria. Here, I suggest that the presence of many bacterial genes with many kinds of functions should not be a surprise. The operation of a gene transfer ratchet would inevitably result in the replacement of nuclear genes of early eukaryotes by genes from the bacteria taken by them as food.

11323671|a|Chromophyte algae differ fundamentally from plants in possessing chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll c and that have a more complex bounding-membrane topology. Although chromophytes are known to be evolutionary chimaeras of a red alga and a non-photosynthetic host, which gave rise to their exceptional membrane complexity, their cell biology is poorly understood. Cryptomonads are the only chromophytes that still retain the enslaved red algal nucleus as a minute nucleomorph. Here we report complete sequences for all three nucleomorph chromosomes from the cryptomonad Guillardia theta. This tiny 551-kilobase eukaryotic genome is the most gene-dense known, with only 17 diminutive spliceosomal introns and 44 overlapping genes. Marked evolutionary compaction hundreds of millions of years ago eliminated nearly all the nucleomorph genes for metabolic functions, but left 30 for chloroplast-located proteins. To allow expression of these proteins, nucleomorphs retain hundreds of genetic-housekeeping genes. Nucleomorph DNA replication and periplastid protein synthesis require the import of many nuclear gene products across endoplasmic reticulum and periplastid membranes. The chromosomes have centromeres, but possibly only one loop domain, offering a means for studying eukaryotic chromosome replication, segregation and evolution.

12566585|a|gamma-Tubulin is assumed to participate in microtubule nucleation in acentrosomal plant cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we show that gamma-tubulin is present in protein complexes of various sizes and different subcellular locations in Arabidopsis and fava bean. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an association of gamma-tubulin with alphabeta-tubulin dimers. gamma-Tubulin cosedimented with microtubules polymerized in vitro and localized along their whole length. Large gamma-tubulin complexes resistant to salt treatment were found to be associated with a high-speed microsomal fraction. Blue native electrophoresis of detergent-solubilized microsomes showed that the molecular mass of the complexes was >1 MD. Large gamma-tubulin complexes were active in microtubule nucleation, but nucleation activity was not observed for the smaller complexes. Punctate gamma-tubulin staining was associated with microtubule arrays, accumulated with short kinetochore microtubules interacting in polar regions with membranes, and localized in the vicinity of nuclei and in the area of cell plate formation. Our results indicate that the association of gamma-tubulin complexes with dynamic membranes might ensure the flexibility of noncentrosomal microtubule nucleation. Moreover, the presence of other molecular forms of gamma-tubulin suggests additional roles for this protein species in microtubule organization.

11781568|a|Asymmetric cell division requires the orientation of mitotic spindles along the cell-polarity axis. In Drosophila neuroblasts, this involves the interaction of the proteins Inscuteable (Insc) and Partner of inscuteable (Pins). We report here that a human Pins-related protein, called LGN, is instead essential for the assembly and organization of the mitotic spindle. LGN is cytoplasmic in interphase cells, but associates with the spindle poles during mitosis. Ectopic expression of LGN disrupts spindle-pole organization and chromosome segregation. Silencing of LGN expression by RNA interference also disrupts spindle-pole organization and prevents normal chromosome segregation. We found that LGN binds the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein NuMA, which tethers spindles at the poles, and that this interaction is required for the LGN phenotype. Anti-LGN antibodies and the LGN-binding domain of NuMA both trigger microtubule aster formation in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts, and the NuMA-binding domain of LGN blocks aster assembly in egg extracts treated with taxol. Thus, we have identified a mammalian Pins homologue as a key regulator of spindle organization during mitosis.

14570572|a|Internalization of receptors, lipids, pathogens, and other cargo at the plasma membrane involves several different pathways and requires coordinated interactions between a variety of protein and lipid molecules. The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex, and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.

12006626|a|The molecular basis of microtubule nucleation is still not known in higher plant cells. This process is better understood in yeast and animals cells. In the yeast spindle pole body and the centrosome in animal cells, gamma-tubulin small complexes and gamma-tubulin ring complexes, respectively, nucleate all microtubules. In addition to gamma-tubulin, Spc98p or its homologues plays an essential role. We report here the characterization of rice and Arabidopsis homologues of SPC98. Spc98p colocalizes with gamma-tubulin at the nuclear surface where microtubules are nucleated on isolated tobacco nuclei and in living cells. AtSpc98p-GFP also localizes at the cell cortex. Spc98p is not associated with gamma-tubulin along microtubules. These data suggest that multiple microtubule-nucleating sites are active in plant cells. Microtubule nucleation involving Spc98p-containing gamma-tubulin complexes could then be conserved among all eukaryotes, despite differences in structure and spatial distribution of microtubule organizing centers.

They are known principally for their pivotal role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, but their ability to influence cell polarity, microtubule dynamics, membrane transport pathways and transcription factor activity is probably just as significant. Underlying this biological complexity is a simple biochemical idea, namely that by switching on a single GTPase, several distinct signalling pathways can be coordinately activated. With spatial and temporal activation of multiple switches factored in, it is not surprising to find Rho GTPases having such a prominent role in eukaryotic cell biology.

6377086|a|Directional cell locomotion is displayed by many cell types both in vivo and in vitro. In many instances, persistency and directionality are imposed by external stimuli such as chemical attractants or substrate properties. Some cell types, such as fibroblasts or leukocytes, are capable of migrating in the absence of known stimuli in a pattern known as persistent random walk, where the direction of movement is maintained for at least one cell diameter before the cell performs a sudden directional change. In many examples of persistent motility, microtubules are believed to have a key role as elements that stabilize or even determine a cell's direction of movement. If disassembled, persistency is reduced or impaired. Despite some reports to the contrary, these and other observations have led to the widely accepted view that microtubules may be the overall organizers of cell geometry, polarity and motile activity. Here we report that rapid, directional locomotion of fish epidermal keratocytes is independent of the presence of microtubules. Moreover, small cytoplasmic fragments derived from the anterior lamella of these cells are capable of locomoting in a pattern indistinguishable from that of intact cells. Since these fragments contain no nucleus, microtubules or centrioles, the persistency-determining component must be sought in some other component(s) of the cytoplasm, possibly the motile machinery of the lamella itself.

1740470|a|Locomoting cells are characterized by a pronounced external and internal anterior-posterior polarity. One of the events associated with cell polarization at the onset of locomotion is a shift of the centrosome, or MTOC, ahead of the nucleus. This position is believed to be of strategic importance for directional cell movement and cell polarity. We have used BSC-1 cells at the edge of an in vitro wound to clarify the causal relationship between MTOC position and the initiation of cell polarization. We find that pronounced cell polarization (the extension of a lamellipod) can take place in the absence of MTOC repositioning or microtubules. Conversely, MTOCs will reposition even after lamellar extension and cell polarization have occurred. Repositioning requires microtubules that extend to the cell periphery and is independent of selective detyrosination of microtubules extending towards the cell front. Significantly, MTOCs maintain, or at least attempt to maintain, a position at the cell's centroid. This is most clearly demonstrated in wounded monolayers of enucleated cells where the MTOC closely follows the centroid position. We suggest that the primary response to the would is the biased extension of a lamellipod, which can occur in the absence of microtubules and MTOC repositioning. Lamellipod extension leads to a shift of the cell's centroid towards the wound. The MTOC, in an attempt to maintain a position near the cell center, will follow. This will automatically put the MTOC ahead of the nucleus in the vast majority of cells. The nucleus as a reference for MTOC position may not be as meaningful as previously thought.

12486218|a|Recent in vivo as well as in vitro experiments have indicated that microtubule pushing alone is sufficient to position a microtubule-organizing center within a cell. Here, we investigate the effect of catastrophes on the dynamics of microtubule asters within microfabricated chambers that mimic the confining geometry of living cells. The use of a glass bead as the microtubule-organizing center allows us to manipulate the aster by using optical tweezers. In the case in which microtubules preexist, we show that because of microtubule buckling, repositioning almost never occurs after relocation with the optical tweezers, although initial microtubule growth always leads the aster to the geometrical center of the chamber. When a catastrophe promoter is added, we find instead that the aster is able to efficiently explore the chamber geometry even after being relocated with the optical tweezers. As predicted by theoretical calculations, the results of our in vitro experiments clearly demonstrate the need for catastrophes for proper positioning in a confining geometry. These findings correlate with recent observations of nuclear positioning in fission yeast cells.

They provide evidence that filamentous actin and cytoplasmic myosin II are transported along microtubules towards microtubule plus ends, with actin and myosin exhibiting different affinities for the cell's cortex. Our studies further reveal that cell cycle phase modulates the amounts of both polymerized actin and myosin II associated with the cortex.

An improved method for actin visualization, the simultaneous fixation and staining with rhodamine-labelled phalloidin during microscopical observation, revealed abundant actin filaments of no preferential orientation in the apical clear zone. Microtubules, visualized by indirect immunofluorescence, were mostly absent from the apices of straight-growing pollen tubes but present in those with irregular shape. Double labelling showed that both actin bundles and microtubules had a similar longitudinal or slightly helical orientation in the pollen tube shaft. In the presence of 30 nM calyculin A or okadaic acid, pollen tubes grew very slowly, branched frequently, and contained isolated, randomly oriented, curved actin bundles and microtubules. Treating pollen tubes with calyculin A or okadaic acid after germination arrested growth immediately, reversibly altered the alignment of actin bundles from axial to transverse, and disassembled microtubules. The changes in actin organization caused by the PP2A inhibitors were similar to those observed upon overexpression of AtRop1 (Y. Fu, G. Wu, Z. Yang, Journal of Cell Biology 152: 1019-1032, 2001), suggesting that hyperphosphorylation interferes with the signalling pathway of small GTPases.

10497338|a|The currently accepted universal tree of life based on molecular phylogenies is characterised by a prokaryotic root and the sisterhood of archaea and eukaryotes. The recent discovery that each domain (bacteria, archaea, and eucarya) represents a mosaic of the two others in terms of its gene content has suggested various alternatives in which eukaryotes were derived from the merging of bacteria and archaea. In all these scenarios, life evolved from simple prokaryotes to complex eukaryotes. We argue here that these models are biased by overconfidence in molecular phylogenies and prejudices regarding the primitive nature of prokaryotes. We propose instead a universal tree of life with the root in the eukaryotic branch and suggest that many prokaryotic features of the information processing mechanisms originated by simplification through gene loss and non-orthologous displacement.

8596939|a|The centrosome plays a vital role in mitotic fidelity, ensuring establishment of bipolar spindles and balanced chromosome segregation. Centrosome duplication occurs only once during the cell cycle and is therefore highly regulated. Here, it is shown that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the p53 tumor suppressor protein, multiple copies of functionally competent centrosomes are generated during a single cell cycle. In contrast, MEFs prepared from normal mice or mice deficient in the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product do not display these abnormalities. The abnormally amplified centrosomes profoundly affect mitotic fidelity, resulting in unequal segregation of chromosomes. These observations implicate p53 in the regulation of centrosome duplication and suggest one possible mechanism by which the loss of p53 may cause genetic instability.

14513312|a|Plant microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are important in modulating the function of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Various plant MAPs have already been described. However, because of the complexity of the plant microtubule cytoskeleton and its responses to developmental and environmental stimuli, there are undoubtedly many more MAPs to be discovered. We have used a literature search and the BLAST protein comparison program to identify which model MAPs from other taxa have close homologues in Arabidopsis thaliana. The search revealed Arabidopsis homologues of 14 model MAPs, with E values (numbers of proteins that will match the model protein merely by chance) of <1 x 10(-10) and homologous domains spanning 98-599 amino acid residues, representing 57.1-97.0% of the model MAP sequence, as well as 22.5-72.8% amino acid identities and 76.3-96.2% conservation of secondary structure in the homologous domain. All of the Arabidopsis homologues have either a full cDNA clone or an expressed sequence tag in the GenBank database and therefore are expressed. The proteins are likely to regulate a variety of functions, including tubulin folding, microtubule nucleation and polymerisation dynamics, microtubule-dependent cell cycle control, organisation of microtubule arrays, interaction of microtubules with plasma-membrane-associated protein complexes, and interactions with various other proteins. The exact functions of these putative MAPs in the plant cell remain to be elucidated empirically. The identification of these putative MAPs opens new avenues for the investigation of the complexities of the plant microtubule cytoskeleton.

10590163|a|The actin cytoskeleton is absolutely required for pollen germination and tube growth, but little is known about the regulation of actin polymer concentrations or dynamics in pollen. Here, we report that latrunculin B (LATB), a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization, had effects on pollen that were distinct from those of cytochalasin D. The equilibrium dissociation constant measured for LATB binding to maize pollen actin was determined to be 74 nM. This high affinity for pollen actin suggested that treatment of pollen with LATB would have marked effects on actin function. Indeed, LATB inhibited maize pollen germination half-maximally at 50 nM, yet it blocked pollen tube growth at one-tenth of that concentration. Low concentrations of LATB also caused partial disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in germinated maize pollen, as visualized by light microscopy and fluorescent-phalloidin staining. The amounts of filamentous actin (F-actin) in pollen were quantified by measuring phalloidin binding sites, a sensitive assay that had not been used previously for plant cells. The amount of F-actin in maize pollen increased slightly upon germination, whereas the total actin protein level did not change. LATB treatment caused a dose-dependent depolymerization of F-actin in populations of maize pollen grains and tubes. Moreover, the same concentrations of LATB caused similar depolymerization in pollen grains before germination and in pollen tubes. These data indicate that the increased sensitivity of pollen tube growth to LATB was not due to general destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton or to decreases in F-actin amounts after germination. We postulate that germination is less sensitive to LATB than tube extension because the presence of a small population of LATB-sensitive actin filaments is critical for maintenance of tip growth but not for germination of pollen, or because germination is less sensitive to partial depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton.

11516644|a|In many cell types, microtubules are thought to direct the spatial distribution of F-actin in cell polarity. Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells exhibit a regulated program of polarized cell growth: after cell division, they grow first in a monopolar manner at the old end, and in G2 phase, initiate growth at the previous cell division site (the new end). The role of microtubule ends in cell polarity is highlighted by the finding that the cell polarity factor, tea1p, is present on microtubule plus ends and cell tips [1].Here, we characterize S. pombe bud6p/fat1p, a homolog of S. cerevisiae Bud6/Aip3. bud6Delta mutant cells have a specific defect in the efficient initiation of growth at the new end and like tea1Delta cells, form T-shaped cells in a cdc11 background. Bud6-GFP localizes to both cell tips and the cytokinesis ring. Maintenance of cell tip localization is dependent upon actin but not microtubules. Bud6-GFP localization is tea1p dependent, and tea1p localization is not bud6p dependent. tea1Delta and bud6Delta cells generally grow in a monopolar manner but exhibit different growth patterns. tea1(Delta)bud6Delta mutants resemble tea1Delta mutants. Tea1p and bud6p coimmunoprecipitate and comigrate in large complexes.Our studies show that tea1p (a microtubule end-associated factor) and bud6p (an actin-associated factor) function in a common pathway, with bud6p downstream of tea1p. To our knowledge, bud6p is the first protein shown to interact physically with tea1p. These studies delineate a pathway for how microtubule plus ends function to polarize the actin cytoskeleton through actin-associated polarity factors.

3818798|a|Cells with polyploid nuclei are generally larger than cells of the same organism or species with nonpolyploid nuclei. However, no such change of cell size with ploidy level is observed in those red algae which alternate isomorphic haploid with diploid generations. The results of this investigation reveal the explanation. Nuclear DNA content and other parameters were measured in cells of the filamentous red alga Griffithsia pacifica. Nuclei of the diploid generation contain twice the DNA content of those of the haploid generation. However, all cells except newly formed reproductive cells are multinucleate. The nuclei are arranged in a nearly perfect hexagonal array just beneath the cell surface. When homologous cells of the two generations are compared, although the cell size is nearly identical, each nucleus of the diploid cell is surrounded by a region of cytoplasm (a "domain") nearly twice that surrounding a haploid nucleus. Cytoplasmic domains associated with a diploid nucleus contain twice the number of plastids, and consequently twice the amount of plastid DNA, than is associated with the domain of a haploid nucleus. Thus, doubling of ploidy is reflected in doubling of the size and organelle content of the domain associated with each nucleus. However, cell size does not differ between homologous cells of the two generations, because total nuclear DNA (sum of the DNA in all nuclei in a cell) per cell does not differ. This is the solution to the cytological paradox of isomorphy.

11729265|a|A diverse group of intracellular microorganisms, including Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella spp., Rickettsia spp., and vaccinia virus, utilize actin-based motility to move within and spread between mammalian host cells. These organisms have in common a pathogenic life cycle that involves a stage within the cytoplasm of mammalian host cells. Within the cytoplasm of host cells, these organisms activate components of the cellular actin assembly machinery to induce the formation of actin tails on the microbial surface. The assembly of these actin tails provides force that propels the organisms through the cell cytoplasm to the cell periphery or into adjacent cells. Each of these organisms utilizes preexisting mammalian pathways of actin rearrangement to induce its own actin-based motility. Particularly remarkable is that while all of these microbes use the same or overlapping pathways, each intercepts the pathway at a different step. In addition, the microbial molecules involved are each distinctly different from the others. Taken together, these observations suggest that each of these microbes separately and convergently evolved a mechanism to utilize the cellular actin assembly machinery. The current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of microbial actin-based motility is the subject of this review.

The mechanisms by which MTs and actin filaments cooperate to mediate these different processes can be grouped into two broad categories: coordinated MT- and actin-based transport to move vesicles, organelles, and cell fate determinants; and targeting and capture of MT ends at cortical actin sites. Over the past several years, a growing number of cellular factors that bridge these cytoskeletal systems have been identified. These include 'hetero-motor' complexes (physically associated myosin and kinesin), myosin-CLIP170 complexes, formin homology (FH) proteins, dynein and the dynactin complex, Kar9p, coronin, Kelch repeat-containing proteins, and ERM proteins.

10611974|a|The compartmentation of eukaryotic cells requires all nuclear proteins to be imported from the cytoplasm, whereas, for example, transfer RNAs, messenger RNAs, and ribosomes are made in the nucleus and need to be exported to the cytoplasm. Nuclear import and export proceed through nuclear pore complexes and can occur along a great number of distinct pathways, many of which are mediated by importin beta-related nuclear transport receptors. These receptors shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm, and they bind transport substrates either directly or via adapter molecules. They all cooperate with the RanGTPase system to regulate the interactions with their cargoes. Another focus of our review is nuclear export of messenger RNA, which apparently largely relies on export mediators distinct from importin beta-related factors. We discuss mechanistic aspects and the energetics of transport receptor function and describe a number of pathways in detail.

This relationship, in turn, leads to important associations between genome size and features such as metabolic rate (at least in homeotherms).

11325054|a|Variation in DNA content has been largely ignored as a factor in evolution, particularly following the advent of sequence-based approaches to genomic analysis. The significant genome size diversity among organisms (more than 200000-fold among eukaryotes) bears no relationship to organismal complexity and both the origins and reasons for the clearly non-random distribution of this variation remain unclear. Several theories have been proposed to explain this 'C-value enigma' (heretofore known as the 'C-value paradox'), each of which can be described as either a mutation pressure' or 'optimal DNA' theory. Mutation pressure theories consider the large portion of non-coding DNA in eukaryotic genomes as either 'junk' or 'selfish' DNA and are important primarily in considerations of the origin of secondary DNA. Optimal DNA theories differ from mutation pressure theories by emphasizing the strong link between DNA content and cell and nuclear volumes. While mutation pressure theories generally explain this association with cell size as coincidental, the nucleoskeletal theory proposes a coevolutionary interaction between nuclear and cell volume, with DNA content adjusted adaptively following shifts in cell size. Each of these approaches to the C-value enigma is problematic for a variety of reasons and the preponderance of the available evidence instead favours the nucleotypic theory which postulates a causal link between bulk DNA amount and cell volume. Under this view, variation in DNA content is under direct selection via its impacts on cellular and organismal parameters. Until now, no satisfactory mechanism has been presented to explain this nucleotypic effect. However, recent advances in the study of cell cycle regulation suggest a possible 'gene nucleus interaction model' which may account for it. The present article provides a detailed review of the debate surrounding the C-value enigma, the various theories proposed to explain it, and the evidence in favour of a causal connection between DNA content and cell size. In addition, a new model of nucleotypic influence is developed, along with suggestions for further empirical investigation. Finally, some evolutionary implications of genome size diversity are considered, and a broadening of the traditional 'biological hierarchy' is recommended.

10207154|a|The forces responsible for modulating the large-scale features of the genome remain one of the most difficult issues confronting evolutionary biology. Although diversity in chromosomal architecture, nucleotide composition, and genome size has been well documented, there is little understanding of either the evolutionary origins or impact of much of this variation. The 80,000-fold divergence in genome sizes among eukaryotes represents perhaps the greatest challenge for genomic holists. Although some researchers continue to characterize much variation in genome size as a mere by-product of an intragenomic selfish DNA "free-for-all" there is increasing evidence for the primacy of selection in molding genome sizes via impacts on cell size and division rates. Moreover, processes inducing quantum or doubling series variation in gametic or somatic genome sizes are common. These abrupt shifts have broad effects on phenotypic attributes at both cellular and organismal levels and may play an important role in explaining episodes of rapid-or even saltational-character state evolution.

12040122|a|Cytokinesis is the final event of the cell division cycle, and its completion results in irreversible partition of a mother cell into two daughter cells. Cytokinesis was one of the first cell cycle events observed by simple cell biological techniques; however, molecular characterization of cytokinesis has been slowed by its particular resistance to in vitro biochemical approaches. In recent years, the use of genetic model organisms has greatly advanced our molecular understanding of cytokinesis. While the outcome of cytokinesis is conserved in all dividing organisms, the mechanism of division varies across the major eukaryotic kingdoms. Yeasts and animals, for instance, use a contractile ring that ingresses to the cell middle in order to divide, while plant cells build new cell wall outward to the cortex. As would be expected, there is considerable conservation of molecules involved in cytokinesis between yeast and animal cells, while at first glance, plant cells seem quite different. However, in recent years, it has become clear that some aspects of division are conserved between plant, yeast, and animal cells. In this review we discuss the major recent advances in defining cytokinesis, focusing on deciding where to divide, building the division apparatus, and dividing. In addition, we discuss the complex problem of coordinating the division cycle with the nuclear cycle, which has recently become an area of intense research. In conclusion, we discuss how certain cells have utilized cytokinesis to direct development.

8159675|a|The genes for two different 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) homologs have been cloned and sequenced from the protozoan Giardia lamblia. On the basis of their sequence features, one of these genes corresponds to the cytoplasmic form of HSP70. The second gene, on the basis of its characteristic N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence and C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequence (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu), is the equivalent of ER-resident GRP78 or the Bip family of proteins. Phylogenetic trees based on HSP70 sequences show that G. lamblia homologs show the deepest divergence among eukaryotic species. The identification of a GRP78 or Bip homolog in G. lamblia strongly suggests the existence of ER in this ancient eukaryote. Detailed phylogenetic analyses of HSP70 sequences by boot-strap neighbor-joining and maximum-parsimony methods show that the cytoplasmic and ER homologs form distinct subfamilies that evolved from a common eukaryotic ancestor by gene duplication that occurred very early in the evolution of eukaryotic cells. It is postulated that because of the essential "molecular chaperone" function of these proteins in translocation of other proteins across membranes, duplication of their genes accompanied the evolution of ER or nucleus in the eukaryotic cell ancestor. The presence in all eukaryotic cytoplasmic HSP70 homologs (including the cognate, heat-induced, and ER forms) of a number of autapomorphic sequence signatures that are not present in any prokaryotic or organellar homologs provides strong evidence regarding the monophyletic nature of eukaryotic lineage. Further, all eukaryotic HSP70 homologs share in common with the Gram-negative group of eubacteria a number of sequence features that are not present in any archaebacterium or Gram-positive bacterium, indicating their evolution from this group of organisms. Some implications of these findings regarding the evolution of eukaryotic cells and ER are discussed.

Based on these observations, it is suggested that the ancestral eukaryotic cell arose by a unique endosymbiotic event involving engulfment of an eocyte archaebacterium by a Gram-negative eubacterial host.

9744297|a|The motile male gamete of the water fern Marsilea vestita is a spirally shaped cell that possesses a complex cytoskeletal array of microtubules and approximately 140 cilia. Spermiogenesis in this organism is a rapid process that requires only approximately 11 h at 20 degrees C and involves the de novo synthesis of basal bodies from an organelle known as a blepharoplast. The developmental program that gives rise to the spermatozoids begins with nine mitotic divisions that occur in rapid succession during the first 5.5 h after imbibition of the dry microspore. During the next 5.5 h, the spermatids undergo a complicated differentiation process. We have asked what new proteins must be made for differentiation to proceed. Inhibitor treatments reveal that some translation is a necessary prerequisite for the differentiation and release of spermatozoids, but methionine-labeling studies demonstrate that relatively few types of proteins must be translated for this developmental program to reach completion. We have found that the dry microspores contain alpha-, beta-, and gamma-tubulin, at levels that may be sufficient for the entire developmental process. The abundance of the tubulins remains essentially constant until very late stages of spermiogenesis. In contrast to the tubulins, we show that centrin begins to increase in abundance at approximately 4 h after imbibition and that it reaches a peak at 6 h after imbibition. We also show that centrin mRNA is stored in the dry microspore, and that centrin protein abundance is regulated at the translational level. We believe that the translation of stored centrin transcripts serves as a rate-limiting step in the rapid differentiation process of spermiogenesis M. vestita. We suggest that centrin functions in the microtubule organizing centers that are required for the construction of the cytoskeleton and the motile apparatus in these structurally complicated cells.

11805300|a|We have collected a set of 347 proteins that are found in eukaryotic cells but have no significant homology to proteins in Archaea and Bacteria. We call these proteins eukaryotic signature proteins (ESPs). The dominant hypothesis for the formation of the eukaryotic cell is that it is a fusion of an archaeon with a bacterium. If this hypothesis is accepted then the three cellular domains, Eukarya, Archaea, and Bacteria, would collapse into two cellular domains. We have used the existence of this set of ESPs to test this hypothesis. The evidence of the ESPs implicates a third cell (chronocyte) in the formation of the eukaryotic cell. The chronocyte had a cytoskeleton that enabled it to engulf prokaryotic cells and a complex internal membrane system where lipids and proteins were synthesized. It also had a complex internal signaling system involving calcium ions, calmodulin, inositol phosphates, ubiquitin, cyclin, and GTP-binding proteins. The nucleus was formed when a number of archaea and bacteria were engulfed by a chronocyte. This formation of the nucleus would restore the three cellular domains as the Chronocyte was not a cell that belonged to the Archaea or to the Bacteria.

24407992|a|Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L., cv. Maryland) mesophyll protoplasts cultivated in saline medium divide by bud formation, migration of one nucleus into the bud, and subsequent furrowing. This process was investigated light and electron microscopically. The cytoplasm of the growing bud is richer in dictyosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum profiles, mitochondria, and small vacuoles than is the cytoplasm of the mother cell, but in early stages lacks plastids. Only patches of wall material are found; most of the cell surface appears naked. Oriented sections of the cleavage furrow do not reveal a contractile ring of microfilaments under the fixation conditions used. The furrow is flanked by numerous microtubules, and is rich in coated vesicles. Nuclear division appears normal, but the phragmoplast vesicles appear empty, and the phragmoplast seems to disintegrate again later. The nucleus migrating into the bud does not show any signs of associated contractile structures. The results demonstrate that, in principle, higher plant cells are capable of a mode of division usually said to be "yeast-like". The events of karyokinesis and cell plate formation are not therefore obligatorily linked processes.

The asymmetric distribution of the GTP-bound form of Ran across the nuclear envelope--that is, large quantities in the nucleus compared with small quantities in the cytoplasm--determines the directionality of many nuclear transport processes. Recent findings that Ran also functions in spindle formation and nuclear envelope assembly during mitosis suggest that Ran has a general role in chromatin-centred processes. Ran functions in these events as a signal for chromosome position.

2743999|a|Depolymerization of the interphase microtubules by nocodazole results in the scattering and apparent fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus in Vero fibroblast cells. Upon removal of the drug, the interphase microtubules repolymerize, and the scattered Golgi elements move back to the region around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) within 40 to 60 min. Using a fluorescent lipid analogue (C6-NBD-ceramide) as a vital stain for the scattered Golgi elements, their relocation was visualized by video-enhanced fluorescence microscopy in Vero cells maintained at 20 degrees C. The NBD-labeled structures were identified as Golgi elements by their colocalization with galactosyltransferase in the fixed cells. During reclustering, NBD-labeled Golgi elements were observed to move by discontinuous saltations towards the MTOC with velocities of 0.1 to 0.4 micron/s. Paths along which Golgi elements moved were super-imposable on microtubules visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. Neither the collapse of intermediate filaments caused by microinjection of antibodies to vimentin nor the disruption of microfilaments by cytochalasin D had an effect on the reclustering of Golgi elements or the positioning of the Golgi apparatus. These data show that scattered Golgi elements move along microtubules back to the region around the MTOC, while neither intact intermediate filaments nor microfilaments are involved.

11175755|a|The origin of eukaryotic cell nuclei by symbiosis of Archaea in Bacteria was proposed on the basis of the phylogenetic topologies of genes. However, it was not possible to conclude whether or not the genes involved were authentic representative genes. Furthermore, using the BLAST and FASTA programs, the similarity of open reading frame (ORF) groups between three domains (Eukarya, Archaea and Bacteria) was estimated at one threshold. Therefore, their similarities at other thresholds could not be clarified. Here we use our newly developed 'homology-hit analysis' method, which uses multiple thresholds, to determine the origin of the nucleus. We removed mitochondria-related ORFs from yeast ORFs, and determined the number of yeast orthologous ORFs in each functional category to the ORFs in six Archaea and nine Bacteria at several thresholds (E-values) using the BLAST. Our results indicate that yeast ORFs related to the nucleus may share their origins with archaeal ORFs, whereas ORFs that are related to the cytoplasm may share their origins with bacterial ORFs. Our results thus strongly support the idea of nucleus symbiosis.

14605233|a|gamma-Tubulin localizes to microtubule-organizing centers in animal and fungal cells where it is important for microtubule nucleation. Plant cells do not have morphologically defined microtubule organizing centers, however, and gamma-tubulin is distributed in small, discrete structures along microtubules. The great difference in distribution has prompted speculation that plant gamma-tubulins function differently from animal and fungal gamma-tubulins. We tested this possibility by expressing Arabidopsis gamma-tubulin in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. At high temperatures, the plant gamma-tubulin was able to bind to microtubule-organizing centers, nucleate microtubule assembly, and support the growth and replication of S. pombe cells lacking endogenous gamma-tubulin. However, the distribution of microtubules was abnormal as was cell morphology, and at low temperatures, cells were arrested in mitosis. These results reveal that Arabidopsis gamma-tubulin can carry out essential functions in S. pombe and is, thus, functionally conserved. The morphological abnormalities reveal that it cannot carry out some nonessential functions, however, and they underscore the importance of gamma-tubulin in morphogenesis of fission yeast cells and in maintaining normal interphase microtubule arrays.

12573250|a|The hyperchromic effect has been used to detect the effect of tau on the transition of double-stranded DNA to single-stranded DNA. It was shown that tau increased the melting temperature of calf thymus DNA from 67 to 81 degrees C and that of plasmid from 75 to 85 degrees C. Kinetically, rates of increase in absorbance at 260 nm of DNA incubated with tau were markedly slower than those of DNA and DNA/bovine serum albumin used as controls during thermal denaturation. In contrast, rates of decrease in the DNA absorbance with tau were faster than those of controls when samples were immediately transferred from thermal conditions to room temperature. It revealed that tau prevented DNA from thermal denaturation, and improved renaturation of DNA. Circular dichroic spectra results indicated that there were little detectable conformational changes in DNA double helix when tau was added. Furthermore, tau showed its ability to protect DNA from hydroxyl radical (.OH) attacking in vitro, implying that tau functions as a DNA-protecting molecule to the radical.

12678504|a|Tau, a major microtubule-associated protein of the neuron, which is known to promote the assembly of and to stabilize microtubules, has also been seen associated with chromatin in neuronal cell lines, but its role in this subcellular compartment is still unknown. In this study, the binding of tau to DNA was investigated using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Using polynucleotide as probe, we found that tau bound to double-stranded but not to single-stranded DNA. Formation of tau-polynucleotide complex was disrupted by alkaline pH and a high concentration of NaCl, but was not affected by dithiothreitol. Electron microscopy revealed that the protein associated with the nucleic acid in a necklacelike manner. DNA-cellulose chromatography and radioimmunodot-blot analyses showed that calf thymus histones VI-S, VII-S and VIII-S could replace both recombinant human brain tau352 (tau-23) and tau441 (tau-40) from DNA. Thus, tau appears to bind to DNA reversibly in the presence of histones.

12244261|a|The developmental stages of the maize embryo sac were correlated with the corresponding silk lengths of ear florets in the female inflorescence. The development of embryo sacs in the ovules of spikes occurs in a gradient pattern with the initiation of the embryo sac beginning at the base of the ear and progressing to the top. At the beginning of meiosis, the presence of conspicuous cortical microtubules coincides with the extensive elongation of the megasporocyte. The spindles at metaphase I and II align along the long axis of the megasporocyte leading to the linear alignment of the dyad and tetrad of megaspores. During megagametogenesis, micropylar and chalazal nuclei of the embryo sac undergo synchronized divisions and migration at the second and third mitosis. Radiate perinuclear microtubules are present during the interphase of the second and third mitosis, and inter-sister nuclear microtubules occur at the late four-nucleate embryo sac. The configuration and orientation of the spindles, phragmoplasts, and pairs of nuclei result in precise positioning of the nuclei. The fusion of the polar nuclei and the formation of a microtubule organizing center-like structure in the filiform apparatus occur right after the first division of the antipodal cells. The different patterns of organization of microtubules in the cells of the mature embryo sac reflect their structural adaptations for their future function.

12239418|a|The indeterminate gametophyte1 mutation in maize has been known to disrupt development of the female gametophyte. Mutant embryo sacs have abnormal numbers and behavior of micropylar and central cell nuclei, which result in polyembryony and elevated ploidy levels in the endosperm of developing kernels. In this study, we confirm abnormal nuclear behavior and present novel findings. In contrast to the normal form, there is no obvious polarity in two-nucleate embryo sacs or in the micropylar cells of eight-nucleate embryo sacs. We show that the second and third mitoses are not fully synchronized and that additional mitoses can occur in all of the nuclei of the mutant embryo sac or in just the micropylar or central regions. After cellularization, individual micropylar cells can undergo mitosis. Abnormal microtubular behavior results in irregular positioning of the nuclei, asynchronous microtubular patterns in different pairs of nuclei, and abnormal phragmoplasts after the third mitotic division. These results indicate that in addition to acting primarily in controlling nuclear divisions, the indeterminate gametophyte1 gene acts secondarily in regulating microtubule behavior. This cytoskeletal activity most likely controls the polarization and nuclear migration underlying the formation and fate of the cells of the normal embryo sac.

We localized translation sites by incubating permeabilized mammalian cells with [3H]lysine or lysyl-transfer RNA tagged with biotin or BODIPY; although most nascent polypeptides were cytoplasmic, some were found in discrete nuclear sites known as transcription "factories." Some of this nuclear translation also depends on concurrent transcription by RNA polymerase II. This coupling is simply explained if nuclear ribosomes translate nascent transcripts as those transcripts emerge from still-engaged RNA polymerases, much as they do in bacteria.

11146620|a|Coordination of microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton is important in several types of cell movement. mDia1 is a member of the formin-homology family of proteins and an effector of the small GTPase Rho. It contains the Rho-binding domain in its amino terminus and two distinct regions of formin homology, FH1 in the middle and FH2 in the carboxy terminus. Here we show that expression of mDia1(DeltaN3), an active mDia1 mutant containing the FH1 and FH2 regions without the Rho-binding domain, induces bipolar elongation of HeLa cells and aligns microtubules in parallel to F-actin bundles along the long axis of the cell. The cell elongation and microtubule alignment caused by this mutant is abolished by co-expression of an FH2-region fragment, and expression of mDia1(DeltaN3) containing point mutations in the FH2 region causes an increase in the amount of disorganized F-actin without cell elongation and microtubule alignment. These results indicate that mDia1 may coordinate microtubules and F-actin through its FH2 and FH1 regions, respectively.

10097118|a|Increasingly, studies of genes and genomes are indicating that considerable horizontal transfer has occurred between prokaryotes. Extensive horizontal transfer has occurred for operational genes (those involved in housekeeping), whereas informational genes (those involved in transcription, translation, and related processes) are seldomly horizontally transferred. Through phylogenetic analysis of six complete prokaryotic genomes and the identification of 312 sets of orthologous genes present in all six genomes, we tested two theories describing the temporal flow of horizontal transfer. We show that operational genes have been horizontally transferred continuously since the divergence of the prokaryotes, rather than having been exchanged in one, or a few, massive events that occurred early in the evolution of prokaryotes. In agreement with earlier studies, we found that differences in rates of evolution between operational and informational genes are minimal, suggesting that factors other than rate of evolution are responsible for the observed differences in horizontal transfer. We propose that a major factor in the more frequent horizontal transfer of operational genes is that informational genes are typically members of large, complex systems, whereas operational genes are not, thereby making horizontal transfer of informational gene products less probable (the complexity hypothesis).

12486237|a|Tubulins, the protein constituents of the microtubule cytoskeleton, are present in all known eukaryotes but have never been found in the Bacteria or Archaea. Here we report the presence of two tubulin-like genes [bacterial tubulin a (btuba) and bacterial tubulin b (btubb)] in bacteria of the genus Prosthecobacter (Division Verrucomicrobia). In this study, we investigated the organization and expression of these genes and conducted a comparative analysis of the bacterial and eukaryotic protein sequences, focusing on their phylogeny and 3D structures. The btuba and btubb genes are arranged as adjacent loci within the genome along with a kinesin light chain gene homolog. RT-PCR experiments indicate that these three genes are cotranscribed, and a probable promoter was identified upstream of btuba. On the basis of comparative modeling data, we predict that the Prosthecobacter tubulins are monomeric, unlike eukaryotic alpha and beta tubulins, which form dimers and are therefore unlikely to form microtubule-like structures. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the Prosthecobacter tubulins are quite divergent and do not support recent horizontal transfer of the genes from a eukaryote. The discovery of genes for tubulin in a bacterial genus may offer new insights into the evolution of the cytoskeleton.

Other than the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, the steps leading to eukaryotic endomembranes and endoskeleton are poorly understood. Ras-family small GTPases are key regulators of cytoskeleton dynamics, vesicular trafficking and nuclear function. They are specific for eukaryotes and their expansion probably traces the evolution of core eukaryote features. The phylogeny of small GTPases suggests that the first endomembranes to evolve during eukaryote evolution had secretory, and not phagocytic, function. Based on the reconstruction of putative roles for ancestral small GTPases, a hypothetical scenario on the origins of the first endomembranes, the nucleus, and phagocytosis is presented.

Pattern formation during embryogenesis generates a basic body organisation, including self-maintaining stem-cell systems called meristems at opposite ends of the main axis of polarity. During post-embryonic development, the meristems produce new organs with reference to the existing body, transforming the juvenile seedling into the species-specific adult plant. Studies in Arabidopsis indicate that patterning in plants involves not only cell surface interactions but also unique modes of communication such as movement of transcription factors between cells and directional transport of the signaling molecule auxin.

In mitosis, Ran-GTP promotes spindle assembly around chromosomes by locally discharging cargoes that regulate microtubule dynamics and organization. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors to visualize gradients of Ran-GTP and liberated cargoes around chromosomes in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts. Both gradients were required to assemble and maintain spindle structure. During interphase, Ran-GTP was highly enriched in the nucleoplasm, and a steep concentration difference between nuclear and cytoplasmic Ran-GTP was established, providing evidence for a Ran-GTP gradient surrounding chromosomes throughout the cell cycle.

12609034|a|Arabidopsis encodes at least eight actin-related proteins (ARPs) most of which have orthologs in other distant organisms. To gain insight into the role of ARPs in plants, we have examined the spatial expression and subcellular distribution of two highly divergent Arabidopsis ARPs, AtARP4 and AtARP7. AtARP4 is a homolog of human BAF53 and yeast Arp4, and AtARP7 is a novel, ancient and plant-specific actin-related protein that is not distinctly related to any known ARPs from other kingdoms. Analysis of both these proteins with AtARP4- and AtARP7-specific antibodies revealed that they were most abundant in young meristematic and floral tissues, but were expressed constitutively in all organs and cell types irrespective of their developmental stage. Immunofluorescence studies showed that both AtARP4 and AtARP7 were localized predominantly to the nucleus during interphase. In mitotic cells lacking a nuclear envelope (e.g. metaphase, anaphase, and early telophase stages), these ARPs were excluded from the condensed chromosomes and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, a putative Arabidopsis histone H2B protein remained associated with the interphase nuclei as well as chromosomes throughout the cell cycle. Based on our results and data on the yeast ortholog of AtARP4, these two nuclear plant ARPs may be involved in the modulation of chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation mainly in interphase cells.

The biochemical and physical principles that govern the assembly of this machine are still unclear. However, accumulated discoveries indicate that chromosomes play a key role. Apparently, they generate a local cytoplasmic state that supports the nucleation and growth of microtubules. Then soluble and chromosome-associated molecular motors sort them into a bipolar array. The emerging picture is that spindle assembly is governed by a combination of modular principles and that their relative contribution may vary in different cell types and in various organisms.

Previous analyses based on morphology and ultrastructure failed to pinpoint both the sister taxon to eukaryotes and the branching order of eukaryotic lineages. However, the expectation that molecular data would provide resolution has not been met since a growing number of gene genealogies present conflicting hypotheses for the origin and diversification of eukaryotes. Instead of reconstructing a simple bifurcating tree of life, these gene genealogies have generated a complex picture of eukaryotic genomes whereby ancient lateral transfers (of individual genes or perhaps even entire genomes) has tangled the evolutionary history of eukaryotes. Resolution of these conflicting genealogies comes in recognizing that eukaryotes are chimeric, containing genetic information from multiple ancestral lineages.

11683319|a|Histones of the H1 group (linker histones) are abundant components of chromatin in eukaryotes, occurring on average at one molecule per nucleosome. The recent reports on the lack of a clear phenotypic effect of knock-out mutations as well as overexpression of histone H1 genes in different organisms have seriously undermined the long-held view that linker histones are essential for the basic functions of eukaryotic cells. In an attempt to resolve the paradox of an abundant conserved protein without a clear function, we re-examined the molecular and phylogenetic data on linker histones to see if they could reveal any correlation between the features of H1 and the functional or morphological characteristics of cells or organisms. Because of an earlier demonstration that in sea urchin the chromatin-type histone H1 is also found in the flagellar microtubules (Multigner et al. 1992), we focused on the correlation between the features of H1 and those of microtubular structures. A phylogenetic tree based on multiple alignment of over 100 available HI sequences suggests that the first divergence of the globular domain of H1 (GH1) resulted in branching into separate types characteristic for plants/Dictyostelium and for animals/ascomycetes, respectively. The GH1s of these two types differ by a short region (usually 5 amino acids) placed at a specific location within the C-terminal wing subdomain of GH1. Evolutionary analysis of the diversification of H1 mRNA into cell-cycle-dependent (polyA-) and independent (polyA+) forms showed a mosaic occurrence of these two forms in plants and animals, despite the fact that the H1 proteins of plants and animals belong to two well-distinguished groups. However, among organisms from both animal and plant kingdom, only those with H1 mRNA of a polyA- type have flagellated gametes. This correlation as well as the demonstration that in Volvox carteri the accumulation of polyA- mRNA of H1 occurs concurrently with the production of new flagella (Lindauer et al. 1993), suggests a direct link between polyA- phenotype of histone H1 mRNA and flagellogenesis.

We characterized tubulin genes from the cryptomonad Guillardia theta. Despite the apparent absence of microtubules in the endosymbiont, we recovered genes encoding alpha-, beta-, and gamma-tubulins from the nucleomorph genome of G. theta. The presence of tubulin genes in the nucleomorph indicates that some component of the cytoskeleton is still present in the cryptomonad symbiont despite the fact that very little cytoplasm remains, no mitosis is known in the nucleomorph, and microtubules have never been observed anywhere in the symbiont. Phylogenetic analyses with nucleomorph alpha- and beta-tubulins support the origin of the cryptomonad nucleomorph from a red alga. We also characterized alpha and beta-tubulins from the host nucleus of G. theta and compared these with tubulins we isolated from two flagellates, Goniomonas truncata and Cyanophora paradoxa, previously proposed to be related to the cryptomonad host. Phylogenetic analyses support a relationship between the cryptomonad host and Goniomonas but do not support any relationship between cryptomonads and Cyanophora.

14517334|a|The small Ran GTPase, a key regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport, is also involved in microtubule assembly and nuclear membrane formation. Herein, we show by immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy, and biochemical analysis that a fraction of Ran is tightly associated with the centrosome throughout the cell cycle. Ran interaction with the centrosome is mediated by the centrosomal matrix A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP450). Accordingly, when AKAP450 is delocalized from the centrosome, Ran is also delocalized, and as a consequence, microtubule regrowth or anchoring is altered, despite the persisting association of gamma-tubulin with the centrosome. Moreover, Ran is recruited to Xenopus sperm centrosome during its activation for microtubule nucleation. We also demonstrate that centrosomal proteins such as centrin and pericentrin, but not gamma-tubulin, AKAP450, or ninein, undertake a nucleocytoplasmic exchange as they concentrate in the nucleus upon export inhibition by leptomycin B. Together, these results suggest a challenging possibility, namely, that centrosome activity could depend upon nucleocytoplasmic exchange of centrosomal proteins and local Ran-dependent concentration at the centrosome.

11285289|a|When centrosomes are destroyed during prophase by laser microsurgery, vertebrate somatic cells form bipolar acentrosomal mitotic spindles (Khodjakov, A., R.W. Cole, B.R. Oakley, and C.L. Rieder. 2000. Curr. Biol. 10:59-67), but the fate of these cells is unknown. Here, we show that, although these cells lack the radial arrays of astral microtubules normally associated with each spindle pole, they undergo a normal anaphase and usually produce two acentrosomal daughter cells. Relative to controls, however, these cells exhibit a significantly higher (30-50%) failure rate in cytokinesis. This failure correlates with the inability of the spindle to properly reposition itself as the cell changes shape. Also, we destroyed just one centrosome during metaphase and followed the fate of the resultant acentrosomal and centrosomal daughter cells. Within 72 h, 100% of the centrosome-containing cells had either entered DNA synthesis or divided. By contrast, during this period, none of the acentrosomal cells had entered S phase. These data reveal that the primary role of the centrosome in somatic cells is not to form the spindle but instead to ensure cytokinesis and subsequent cell cycle progression.

9671692|a|Evolvability is an organism's capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation. Metazoan evolution is marked by great morphological and physiological diversification, although the core genetic, cell biological, and developmental processes are largely conserved. Metazoan diversification has entailed the evolution of various regulatory processes controlling the time, place, and conditions of use of the conserved core processes. These regulatory processes, and certain of the core processes, have special properties relevant to evolutionary change. The properties of versatile protein elements, weak linkage, compartmentation, redundancy, and exploratory behavior reduce the interdependence of components and confer robustness and flexibility on processes during embryonic development and in adult physiology. They also confer evolvability on the organism by reducing constraints on change and allowing the accumulation of nonlethal variation. Evolvability may have been generally selected in the course of selection for robust, flexible processes suitable for complex development and physiology and specifically selected in lineages undergoing repeated radiations.

10899120|a|Spindle pole bodies (SPBs) are the centrosome equivalents in yeast, required for microtubule organization. In yeast, the SPB further serves as the attachment sites of the prospore membrane during meiosis. Here we report the identification of two new meiosis-specific components of the SPB, Mpc54p and Mpc70p, and the first protein specific for the prospore membrane, Don1p. Mpc54p and Mpc70p are not present in mitotic SPBs, and during meiosis II they are components of a meiosis-specific structural alteration of the outer plaque of the SPB. Both proteins are dispensable for the meiotic divisions but are essentially required for the formation of the prospore membrane. In the mpc54 and mpc70 mutants, the Don1p-containing precursors of the prospore membrane can still be found in the cytoplasm and associated with the SPB. Unexpectedly, however, the assembly of the precursors to a continuous membrane system is affected. Thus, the meiotic SPB is directly involved in the formation of a specialized membrane system, the membrane of the prospore.

14636561|a|ACF7 is a member of the spectraplakin family of cytoskeletal crosslinking proteins possessing actin and microtubule binding domains. Here, we show that ACF7 is an essential integrator of MT-actin dynamics. In endodermal cells, ACF7 binds along microtubules but concentrates at their distal ends and at cell borders when polarized. In ACF7's absence, microtubules still bind EB1 and CLIP170, but they no longer grow along polarized actin bundles, nor do they pause and tether to actin-rich cortical sites. The consequences are less stable, long microtubules with skewed cytoplasmic trajectories and altered dynamic instability. In response to wounding, ACF7 null cultures activate polarizing signals, but fail to maintain them and coordinate migration. Rescue of these defects requires ACF7's actin and microtubule binding domains. Thus, spectraplakins are important for controlling microtubule dynamics and reinforcing links between microtubules and polarized F-actin, so that cellular polarization and coordinated cell movements can be sustained.

12154083|a|Microtubule dynamics were investigated in CHO and NRK cells by novel experimental approaches designed to evaluate the microtubule behavior in the cell interior. These approaches were: (1) laser photobleaching of a path through the centrosome; (2) direct observation of microtubules in centrosome-containing cytoplasts; (3) GFP-CLIP-170 expression as a marker for microtubule plus end growth; and (iv) sequential subtraction analysis. The combination of these approaches allowed us to obtain data where the density of microtubules had previously prevented conventional methods to be applicable. In the steady state, nascent microtubules grew persistently from the centrosome towards the cell margin. Frequently, they arrived at the cell margin without undergoing any transition to the shortening phase. In contrast to the growth of microtubules, shortening of the plus ends from the periphery was non-persistent; that is, rescue was frequent and the extent of shortening showed a distribution of lengths reflecting a stochastic process. The combination of persistent growth and a cell boundary led to a difference in apparent microtubule behavior in the cell interior compared with that near the cell margin. Whereas microtubules in the cell interior showed asymmetric transition frequencies, their behavior near the cell margin showed frequent fluctuations between phases of shortening and growth. Complete microtubule turnover was accomplished by the relatively rare episodes of shortening back to the centrosome. Release from the centrosome with subsequent minus end shortening also occurred but was a minor mechanism for microtubule turnover compared with the plus end pathway. We propose a life cycle for a microtubule which consists of rapid growth from the centrosome to the cell margin followed by an indefinite period of fluctuations of phases of shortening and growth. We suggest that persistent growth and asymmetric transition frequencies serve the biological function of providing a mechanism by which microtubules may rapidly accommodate to the changing shape and advancing edge of motile cells.

14558592|a|The merging of two independent populations of heterotrophs and autotrophs into a single population of mixotrophs has occurred frequently in evolutionary history. It is an example of a wide class of related phenomena, known as symbiogenesis. The physiological basis is almost always (reciprocal) syntrophy, where each species uses the products of the other species. Symbiogenesis can repeat itself after specialization on particular assimilatory substrates. We discuss quantitative aspects and delineate eight steps from two free-living interacting populations to a single fully integrated endosymbiotic one. The whole process of gradual interlocking of the two populations could be mimicked by incremental changes of particular parameter values. The role of products gradually changes from an ecological to a physiological one. We found conditions where the free-living, epibiotic and endobiotic populations of symbionts can co-exist, as well as conditions where the endobiotic symbionts outcompete other symbionts. Our population dynamical analyses give new insights into the evolution of cellular homeostasis. We show how structural biomass with a constant chemical composition can evolve in a chemically varying environment if the parameters for the formation of products satisfy simple constraints. No additional regulation mechanisms are required for homeostasis within the context of the dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory for the uptake and use of substrates by organisms. The DEB model appears to be dosed under endosymbiosis. This means that when each free-living partner follows DEB rules for substrate uptake and use, and they become engaged in an endosymbiotic relationship, a gradual transition to a single fully integrated system is possible that again follows DEB rules for substrate uptake and use.

12960380|a|Structural protein 4.1, which has crucial interactions within the spectrin-actin lattice of the human red cell membrane skeleton, also is widely distributed at diverse intracellular sites in nucleated cells. We previously showed that 4.1 is essential for assembly of functional nuclei in vitro and that the capacity of 4.1 to bind actin is required. Here we report that 4.1 and actin colocalize in mammalian cell nuclei using fluorescence microscopy and, by higher-resolution detergent-extracted cell whole-mount electron microscopy, are associated on nuclear filaments. We also devised a cell-free assay using Xenopus egg extract containing fluorescent actin to follow actin during nuclear assembly. By directly imaging actin under nonperturbing conditions, the total nuclear actin population is retained and visualized in situ relative to intact chromatin. We detected actin initially when chromatin and nuclear pores began assembling. As nuclear lamina assembled, but preceding DNA synthesis, actin distributed in a reticulated pattern throughout the nucleus. Protein 4.1 epitopes also were detected when actin began to accumulate in nuclei, producing a diffuse coincident pattern. As nuclei matured, actin was detected both coincident with and also independent of 4.1 epitopes. To test whether acquisition of nuclear actin is required for nuclear assembly, the actin inhibitor latrunculin A was added to Xenopus egg extracts during nuclear assembly. Latrunculin A strongly perturbed nuclear assembly and produced distorted nuclear structures containing neither actin nor protein 4.1. Our results suggest that actin as well as 4.1 is necessary for nuclear assembly and that 4.1-actin interactions may be critical.

3327863|a|In most animal cells, the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC) and the Golgi apparatus (GA) are co-localized on one side of the nucleus, an arrangement that allows these cells to acquire a functional polarity. An exception has been reported in the skeletal muscle myotube, where the MTOC and GA exhibit a circumnuclear distribution. We wished to determine if this unusual distribution of the MTOC and GA was peculiar to syncytial myotubes or reflected a pattern found in muscle cells generally. Immunofluorescence microscopic studies of cultured chicken skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and gizzard smooth muscle cells were carried out using preimmune sera that recognized the pericentriolar material, anti-tubulin antibodies to label the MTOC, and fluorescent wheat-germ agglutinin to label the GA. These studies have shown that cardiac myocytes possess a circumnuclear distribution of their MTOC and GA as do skeletal myotubes, but smooth muscle cells exhibit the centrosomal MTOC and GA distribution found in most other cells. The circumnuclear MTOC/GA distribution therefore is associated with striated muscle cells. We also found that as embryonic cardiac myocytes pass through the cell cycle the microtubule-organizing activity in these cells switches from a circumnuclear distribution in interphase to the conventional centrosomal location during mitosis. Thus, cardiac myocytes provide a rare example of mononucleated animal cells that do not display a centrosomal MTOC or a polarized GA, and also reveal a system in which the MTOC structure can be reversibly altered in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

12602947|a|Cortical microtubules are considered to regulate the direction of cellulose microfibril deposition. Despite their significant role in determining cell morphology, cortical microtubules completely disappear from the cell cortex during M phase and become reorganized at G1 phase. The mechanism by which these microtubules become properly formed again is, however, still unclear. We have proposed that the origin of cortical microtubules is on the daughter nuclear surface, but further cortical microtubule reorganization occurs at the cell cortex. Hence it is probable that the locations of microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) are actively changing. However, the actual MTOC sites of cortical microtubules were not clearly determined. In this paper, we have examined the distribution of gamma-tubulin, one of the key molecules of MTOCs in various organisms, during cortical microtubule reorganization using both immunofluorescence and a GFP reporter system. Using a monoclonal antibody (clone G9) that recognizes highly conserved residues in y-tubulin, y-tubulin was found to be constitutively expressed and to be clearly localized to microtubule structures, such as the preprophase bands, spindles, and phragmoplasts, specific to each cell cycle stage. This distribution pattern was confirmed by the GFP reporter system. During cortical microtubule reorganization at the M to G1 transition phase, gamma-tubulin first accumulated at the daughter nuclear surfaces, and then seemed to spread onto the cell cortex along with microtubules elongating from the daughter nuclei. Based on the results, it was confirmed that daughter nuclear surfaces acted as origins of cortical microtubules, and that further reorganization occurred on the cell cortex.

In most cell types, the position of the mitotic spindle at the onset of anaphase dictates the orientation of the division axis; in unicellular organisms, it plays an important role in chromosome segregation. Cortical factors play a key role in the orientation of the spindle. Recent data from yeast reveal that the spindle does not passively react to cortical signals but actively interprets them to find its correct position.

19866635|a|This paper reports an electron microscope examination of the cortices of some plant cells engaged in wall formation. Previous studies of similar material fixed in OSO(4) alone have disclosed discontinuities in the plasma membrane and other evidence of inadequate fixation. After glutaraldehyde, used as a fixative in this present study, the general preservation of cortical fine structure is greatly improved. This is shown, for example, by the first evidence of slender tubules, 230 to 270 A in diameter and of indeterminate length, in plant cells of this type. They have been found in the cortical regions of cells of two angiosperms and one gymnosperm, representing all the material so far studied following this method of fixation. The tubules are identical in morphology to those also observed here in the mitotic spindles of plant cells, except that the latter have a somewhat smaller diameter. It is noted that the cortical tubules are in a favored position to govern cytoplasmic streaming and to exert an influence over the disposition of cell wall materials. In this regard it may be of some significance that the tubules just beneath the surface of the protoplast mirror the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils of the adjacent cell walls.

12972545|a|We examined spindle morphology and chromosome alignment in vertebrate cells after simultaneous perturbation of the chromokinesin Kid and either NuMA, CENP-E, or HSET. Spindle morphology and chromosome alignment after simultaneous perturbation of Kid and either HSET or CENP-E were no different from when either HSET or CENP-E was perturbed alone. However, short bipolar spindles with organized poles formed after perturbation of both Kid and NuMA in stark contrast to splayed spindle poles observed after perturbation of NuMA alone. Spindles were disorganized if Kid, NuMA, and HSET were perturbed, indicating that HSET is sufficient for spindle organization in the absence of Kid and NuMA function. In addition, chromosomes failed to align efficiently at the spindle equator after simultaneous perturbation of Kid and NuMA despite appropriate kinetochore-microtubule interactions that generated chromosome movement at normal velocities. These data indicate that a functional relationship between the chromokinesin Kid and the spindle pole organizing protein NuMA influences spindle morphology, and we propose that this occurs because NuMA forms functional linkages between kinetochore and nonkinetochore microtubules at spindle poles. In addition, these data show that both Kid and NuMA contribute to chromosome alignment in mammalian cells.

Based on the observation of phagokinetic tracks, we found that the syncitia were able to locomote if the MTOCs aggregated into a common centrosphere cluster, and the clustered centrospheres were excluded from the cluster of nuclei of the syncitium. The results suggest that each individual pair of one nucleus and one centrosphere contributes, in a process of vectorial addition, its individual polarity to the polarity of the syncitium. Thus the widely accepted idea that the centrosphere is involved in the determination of cell polarity can be generalized beyond the case of single cells.

7686171|a|An antibody specific for a conserved gamma-tubulin peptide identifies a plant polypeptide of 58 kDa. gamma-Tubulin antibody affinity purified from this polypeptide recognizes the centrosome in mammalian cells. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we determined the distribution of this gamma-tubulin-related polypeptide during the complex changes in microtubule arrays that occur throughout the plant cell cycle. We report a punctate association of gamma-tubulin-related polypeptide with the cortical microtubule array and the preprophase band. As cells enter prophase, gamma-tubulin-related polypeptide accumulates around the nucleus and forms a polar cap from which early spindle microtubules radiate. During metaphase and anaphase, gamma-tubulin-related polypeptide preferentially associates with kinetochore fibers and eventually accumulates at the poles. In telophase, localization occurs over the phragmoplast. gamma-Tubulin-related polypeptide appears to be excluded from the plus ends of microtubules at the metaphase plate and cell plate.

Since their discovery in plants 40 years ago, microtubules have been suspected of forming a template that helps to regulate the direction of growth. The detailed mechanism, however, has been elusive, especially as plants lack a microtubule-organizing centre. Developmental mutants are now beginning to show how microtubules are organized and how this affects plant morphology.

11294887|a|During skeletal muscle differentiation, the Golgi complex (GC) undergoes a dramatic reorganization. We have now visualized the differentiation and fusion of living myoblasts of the mouse muscle cell line C2, permanently expressing a mannosidase-green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct. These experiments reveal that the reorganization of the GC is progressive (1-2 h) and is completed before the cells start fusing. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), immunofluorescence, and immunogold electron microscopy demonstrate that the GC is fragmented into elements localized near the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites. FRAP analysis and the ER relocation of endogenous GC proteins by phospholipase A2 inhibitors demonstrate that Golgi-ER cycling of resident GC proteins takes place in both myoblasts and myotubes. All results support a model in which the GC reorganization in muscle reflects changes in the Golgi-ER cycling. The mechanism is similar to that leading to the dispersal of the GC caused, in all mammalian cells, by microtubule-disrupting drugs. We propose that the trigger for the dispersal results, in muscle, from combined changes in microtubule nucleation and ER exit site localization, which place the ER exit sites near microtubule minus ends. Thus, changes in GC organization that initially appear specific to muscle cells, in fact use pathways common to all mammalian cells.

Cues from sperm-donated centrosomes result in a cascade of events that polarize the distribution of widely conserved PAR proteins at the cell cortex. The PAR proteins in turn polarize the cytoplasm and position mitotic spindles. Lessons learned from C. elegans should improve our understanding of how cells become polarized and divide asymmetrically during development.

12142285|a|Spindle microtubules interact with mitotic chromosomes, binding to their kinetochores to generate forces that are important for accurate chromosome segregation. Motor enzymes localized both at kinetochores and spindle poles help to form the biologically significant attachments between spindle fibers and their cargo, but microtubule-associated proteins without motor activity contribute to these junctions in important ways. This review examines the molecules necessary for chromosome-microtubule interaction in a range of well-studied organisms, using biological diversity to identify the factors that are essential for organized chromosome movement. We conclude that microtubule dynamics and the proteins that control them are likely to be more important for mitosis than the current enthusiasm for motor enzymes would suggest.

Plastid division relies on proteins that are also responsible for bacterial division, although may of the genes for these proteins have been confiscated by the host. Plastid protein import on the other hand relies on proteins that seem to have functioned originally as exporters but that have now been persuaded to operate in the reverse direction to traffic proteins from the host cell into the endosymbiont.

11331898|a|Disruption of the cell plasma membrane is a commonplace occurrence in many mechanically challenging, biological environments. 'Resealing' is the emergency response required for cell survival. Resealing is triggered by Ca2+ entering through the disruption; this causes vesicles present in cytoplasm underlying the disruption site to fuse rapidly with one another (homotypically) and also with the adjacent plasma membrane (heterotypically/exocytotically). The large vesicular products of homotypic fusion are added as a reparative 'patch' across the disruption, when its resealing requires membrane replacement. The simultaneous activation of the local cytoskeleton supports these membrane fusion events. Resealing is clearly a complex and dynamic cell adaptation, and, as we emphasize here, may be an evolutionarily primitive one that arose shortly after the ancestral eukaryote lost its protective cell wall.

12672953|a|The capacity to reseal a plasma membrane disruption rapidly is required for cell survival in many physiological environments. Intracellular membrane (endomembrane) is thought to play a central role in the rapid resealing response. We here directly compare the resealing response of a cell that lacks endomembrane, the red blood cell, with that of several nucleated cells possessing an abundant endomembrane compartment. RBC membrane disruptions inflicted by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser, even those initially smaller than hemoglobin, failed to reseal rapidly. By contrast, much larger laser-induced disruptions made in sea urchin eggs, fibroblasts, and neurons exhibited rapid, Ca(2+)-dependent resealing. We conclude that rapid resealing is not mediated by simple physiochemical mechanisms; endomembrane is required.

17815080|a|A successive pattern of nuclear divisions that result in mitotic waves has been observed within the coenocytic nonarticulated laticifers of embryos of Euphorbia marginata Pursh. These waves originate independently in the cotyledonary or hypocotyl portion of the laticifer and exhibit uni-or bidirectional movement at variable velocities. Individual nuclei or groups of neighoring nuclei in a laticifer were observed in a sequence of mitotic stages ranging from prophase to telophase; division activity varied with individual laticifers in an embryo. Two mitotic patterns were apparent in the embryo: a random pattern associated with various cells in the meristematic area, and a successive pattern restricted to the laticifer. A substance, synthesized by and restricted to the laticifer, may be associated with this mitotic pattern.

6891383|a|We examined the formation of motile, chemotactically active, anucleate fragments from human blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN, granulocytes), induced by the brief application of heat. These granule-poor fragments are former protopods (leading fronts, lamellipodia) that become uncoupled from the main body of the cell and leave it, at first with a connecting filament that breaks and seals itself. The usual random orientation of such filaments can be controlled by preorientation of cells in a gradient of the chemotactic peptide, N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (F-Met-Leu-Phe) (2x10(-9) M- 1x10(-8)). Cytochalsin B, 2.5-5 mug/ml, prevents fragment formation; colchicine, 10(-5) M, does not. In scanning electron micrographs, fragments are ruffled and the cell body rounded up and rather smooth. In transmission electron micrographs, fragments contain microfilaments but lack centrioles and microtubules. Like intact cells, both bound and free fragments can respond chemotactically to an erythrocyte destroyed by laser microirradiation (necrotaxis); the free, anucleate fragments may do so repeatedly, even after having been held overnight at ambient temperatures. We propse the name cytokineplast for the result of this self-purification of motile apparatus. The exodus of the motile machinery from the granulocyte requires anchoring of the bulk of the cell to glass and uncoupling, which may involve heat-induced dysfunction of the centrosome. In ultrastructural studies of the centrosomal region after heat, centriolar structure remains intact, but pericentriolar osmiophilic material appears condensed, and microtubules are sparse. These changes are found in all three blood cell types examined: PMN, eosinophil, and monocyte. Of these, the first two make fragments under our conditions; the more sluggish monocyte does not. Uncoupling is further linked to centrosomal dysfunction by the observation that colchicines-treated granulocytes (10(-5)M, to destroy the centrosome's efferent arm) make fragments after less heat than controls. If motive force and orientation are specified mainly from the organelle-excluding leading front, then endoplasmic streaming in PMN is a catch-up phenomenon, and microtubules do not provide the vector of locomotion but rather stabilize and orient the "baggage" (nucleus, granuloplasm)-i.e., they prevent fishtailing. Moreover, constraints emanating from the centrosome may now be extended to include, maintenance of the motile machinery as an integral part of the cell.

14583738|a|Histones are best known as the architectural proteins that package the DNA of eukaryotic organisms, forming octameric nucleosome cores that the double helix wraps tightly around. Although histones have traditionally been viewed as slowly evolving scaffold proteins that lack diversification beyond their abundant tail modifications, recent studies have revealed that variant histones have evolved for diverse functions. H2A and H3 variants have diversified to assume roles in epigenetic silencing, gene expression and centromere function. Such diversification of histone variants and 'deviants' contradicts the perception of histones as monotonous members of multigene families that indiscriminately package and compact the genome. How these diverse functions have evolved from ancestral forms can be addressed by applying phylogenetic tools to increasingly abundant sequence data.

14697201|a|The centrosome and nucleus are intimately associated in most animal cells, yet the significance of this interaction is unknown. Mutations in the zyg-12 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans perturb the attachment of the centrosome to the nucleus, giving rise to aberrant spindles and ultimately, DNA segregation defects and lethality. These phenotypes indicate that the attachment is essential. ZYG-12 is a member of the Hook family of cytoskeletal linker proteins and localizes to both the nuclear envelope (via SUN-1) and centrosomes. ZYG-12 is able to bind the dynein subunit DLI-1 in a two-hybrid assay and is required for dynein localization to the nuclear envelope. Loss of dynein function causes a low percentage of defective centrosome/nuclei interactions in both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. We propose that dynein and ZYG-12 move the centrosomes toward the nucleus, followed by a ZYG-12/SUN-1-dependent anchorage.

11572984|a|The leading edge of motile cells is propelled by polymerization of actin filaments according to a dendritic nucleation/array treadmilling mechanism. However, little attention has been given to the origin and maintenance of the dendritic array. Here we develop and test a population-kinetics model that explains the organization of actin filaments in terms of the reproduction of dendritic units. The life cycle of an actin filament consists of dendritic nucleation on another filament (birth), elongation by addition of actin subunits and, finally, termination of filament growth by capping protein (death). The regularity of branch angle between daughter and mother filaments endows filaments with heredity of their orientation. Fluctuations of branch angle that become fixed in the actin network create errors of orientation (mutations) that may be inherited. In our model, birth and death rates depend on filament orientation, which then becomes a selectable trait. Differential reproduction and elimination of filaments, or natural selection, leads to the evolution of a filament pattern with a characteristic distribution of filament orientations. We develop a procedure based on the Radon transform for quantitatively analyzing actin networks in situ and show that the experimental results are in agreement with the distribution of filament orientations predicted by our model. We conclude that the propulsive actin network can be understood as a self-organizing supramolecular ensemble shaped by the evolution of dendritic lineages through natural selection of their orientation.

10860956|a|We present a testable model for the origin of the nucleus, the membrane-bounded organelle that defines eukaryotes. A chimeric cell evolved via symbiogenesis by syntrophic merger between an archaebacterium and a eubacterium. The archaebacterium, a thermoacidophil resembling extant Thermoplasma, generated hydrogen sulfide to protect the eubacterium, a heterotrophic swimmer comparable to Spirochaeta or Hollandina that oxidized sulfide to sulfur. Selection pressure for speed swimming and oxygen avoidance led to an ancient analogue of the extant cosmopolitan bacterial consortium "Thiodendron latens." By eubacterial-archaebacterial genetic integration, the chimera, an amitochondriate heterotroph, evolved. This "earliest branching protist" that formed by permanent DNA recombination generated the nucleus as a component of the karyomastigont, an intracellular complex that assured genetic continuity of the former symbionts. The karyomastigont organellar system, common in extant amitochondriate protists as well as in presumed mitochondriate ancestors, minimally consists of a single nucleus, a single kinetosome and their protein connector. As predecessor of standard mitosis, the karyomastigont preceded free (unattached) nuclei. The nucleus evolved in karyomastigont ancestors by detachment at least five times (archamoebae, calonymphids, chlorophyte green algae, ciliates, foraminifera). This specific model of syntrophic chimeric fusion can be proved by sequence comparison of functional domains of motility proteins isolated from candidate taxa.

For about 100 years, the principle of endosymbiosis has figured into thoughts as to how these processes might have occurred. A number of models that have been discussed in the literature and that are designed to explain this difference are summarized. The evolutionary histories of the enzymes of anaerobic energy metabolism (oxygen-independent ATP synthesis) in the three basic types of heterotrophic eukaryotes those that lack organelles of ATP synthesis, those that possess mitochondria and those that possess hydrogenosomes--play an important role in this issue. Traditional endosymbiotic models generally do not address the origin of the heterotrophic lifestyle and anaerobic energy metabolism in eukaryotes. Rather they take it as a given, a direct inheritance from the host that acquired mitochondria. Traditional models are contrasted to an alternative endosymbiotic model (the hydrogen hypothesis), which addresses the origin of heterotrophy and the origin of compartmentalized energy metabolism in eukaryotes.

11839792|a|The Ran GTPase is an essential protein that has multiple functions in eukaryotic cells. Fission yeast cells in which Ran is misregulated arrest after mitosis with condensed, unreplicated chromosomes and abnormal nuclear envelopes. The fission yeast sns mutants arrest with a similar cell cycle block and interact genetically with the Ran system. sns-A10, sns-B2 and sns-B9 have mutations in the fission yeast homologues of S. cerevisiae Sar1p, Sec31p and Sec53p, respectively, which are required for the early steps of the protein secretory pathway. The three sns mutants accumulate a normally secreted protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), have an increased amount of ER membrane, and the ER/nuclear envelope lumen is dilated. Neither a post-ER block in the secretory pathway, nor ER proliferation caused by overexpression of an integral ER membrane protein, results in a cell cycle-specific defect. Therefore, the arrest seen in sns-A10, sns-B2 and sns-B9 is most likely due to nuclear envelope defects that render the cells unable to re-establish the interphase organization of the nucleus after mitosis. As a consequence, these mutants are unable to decondense their chromosomes or to initiate of the next round of DNA replication.

10099932|a|Organised cell division and expansion play important roles in plant embryogenesis. To address their cellular basis, we have analysed Arabidopsis abnormal-embryo mutants which were isolated for their characteristic phenotype: mutant embryos are small, mushroom-shaped ("pilz") and consist of only one or few large cells each containing one or more variably enlarged nuclei and often cell wall stubs. These 23 mutants represent four genes, PFIFFERLING, HALLIMASCH, CHAMPIGNON, and PORCINO, which map to different chromosomes. All four genes have very similar mutant phenotypes although porcino embryos often consisted of only one large cell. The endosperm did not cellularise and contained a variably reduced number of highly enlarged nuclei. By contrast, genetic evidence suggests that these genes are not required for gametophyte development. Expression of cell cycle genes, Cdc2a, CyclinA2 and CyclinB1, and the cytokinesis-specific KNOLLE gene was not altered in mutant embryos. However, KNOLLE syntaxin accumulated in patches but no KNOLLE-positive structure resembling a forming cell plate occurred in mitotic cells. A general defect in microtubule assembly was observed in all mutants. Interphase cells lacked cortical microtubules, and spindles were absent from mitotic nuclei although in rare cases, short stubs of microtubules were attached to partially condensed chromosomes. Our results suggest that the cellular components affected by the pilz group mutations are necessary for continuous microtubule organisation, mitotic division and cytokinesis but do not mediate cell cycle progression.

No alternative explanation has replaced it. The historical problem was the failure to identify centrosomes as compact physical bodies in a great many kinds of cells. In this essay, I consider the evidence that centrosomes are flexible bodies; they may take on alternative forms and their forms determine the shapes of mitotic poles and other organizers of microtubular structures. Compact corpuscular centrosomes are not necessary and would not be expected in cases where microtubules clearly do not originate from point sources. A model of the flexible centrosome is introduced and the speculation that the centrosome is a bearer of morphological information is considered.

12386932|a|Embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster begins with a rapid series of mitotic nuclear divisions, unaccompanied by cytokinesis, to produce a multi-nucleated single cell embryo, the syncytial blastoderm. The syncytium then undergoes a process of cell formation, in which the individual nuclei become enclosed in individual cells. This process of cellularization involves integrating mechanisms of cell polarity, cell-cell adhesion and a specialized form of cytokinesis. The detailed molecular mechanism, however, is highly complex and, despite extensive analysis, remains poorly understood. Nevertheless, new insights are emerging from recent studies on aspects of membrane polarization and insertion, which show that membrane components from intracellular organelles are involved. In addition, actin and actin-associated proteins have been heavily implicated while new evidence shows that microtubule cytoskeletal elements are mechanistically involved in all aspects of cellularization. This review will draw on both the traditional models and the new data to provide a current perspective on the nature of cellular blastoderm formation in Drosophila melanogaster.

8577841|a|Actin filaments and microtubules form the cytoskeleton of all eukaryotic cells, and they are responsible for organizing the cytoplasm and supporting motile processes. Both polymers are highly dynamic, and their polymerization dynamics are central to their organization. Though their evolutionary origins appear to be distinct, actin and tubulin have a similar mechanism for promoting polymerization dynamics in which the energy of nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis during polymerization is used to weaken the bonds between subunits, thus promoting subsequent depolymerization. The evolutionary origins of actin and tubulin are unclear. It is likely that motile mechanisms driven by reversible polymerization, termed thermal ratchets, are older than those based on ATPase motor proteins. Such mechanisms are still important in modern eukaryotes, and may have powered early versions of the critical motile processes of phagocytosis and chromosome segregation in primitive cells. Thus evolution of dynamic cytoskeletal polymers may have been one of the earliest and most important steps leading to the evolution of eukaryotes. Plausible evolutionary pathways can be constructed leading from simple enzymes to dynamic cytoskeletal polymers.

14690601|a|Bacterial DNA segregation takes place in an active and ordered fashion. In the case of Escherichia coli plasmid R1, the partitioning system (par) separates paired plasmid copies and moves them to opposite cell poles. Here we address the mechanism by which the three components of the R1 par system act together to generate the force required for plasmid movement during segregation. ParR protein binds cooperatively to the centromeric parC DNA region, thereby forming a complex that interacts with the filament-forming actin-like ParM protein in an ATP-dependent manner, suggesting that plasmid movement is powered by insertional polymerization of ParM. Consistently, we find that segregating plasmids are positioned at the ends of extending ParM filaments. Thus, the process of R1 plasmid segregation in E. coli appears to be mechanistically analogous to the actin-based motility operating in eukaryotic cells. In addition, we find evidence suggesting that plasmid pairing is required for ParM polymerization.

11135312|a|RCC1, the chromatin-bound guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small nuclear GTPase, Ran, is required for coordinating the onset of mitosis with S-phase completion in mammalian cells. Other defects in the Ran-GTPase network also result in disruption of cell-cycle processes such as DNA replication, exit from mitosis and, at least in budding yeast, accurate chromosome segregation. However, the Ran system is now best known for its pivotal role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, where RanGTP is used as a positional flag for the nucleus during interphase. Ran's effectors are the shuttling transport factors, importins and exportins, which facilitate the transit of cargoes between the nucleus and cytoplasm: RanGTP regulates their cargo-binding properties so that they can move their cargo in the correct direction. RanGTP also plays a separate role during mitosis, influencing microtubule polymerisation, possibly specifically in the vicinity of chromosomes. Most recently, Ran has been shown to be crucial for the regeneration of a nuclear envelope after exit from mitosis. So, can the problems with cell-cycle progression and control induced by perturbing the Ran-system be attributed to defects in these three processes? This article examines this issue, concentrating on vertebrate systems. BioEssays 23:77-85, 2001.

11967185|a|We have studied Golgi apparatus dynamics during mouse oocyte in vitro maturation, employing both live imaging with the fluorescent lipid BODIPY-ceramide and immunocytochemistry using several specific markers (beta-COP, giantin, and TGN38). In germinal vesicle oocytes the Golgi consisted of a series of structures, possibly cisternal stacks, dispersed in the ooplasm, but slightly more concentrated in the interior than at the cortex. A similar pattern was detected in rhesus monkey germinal vesicle oocytes. These "mini-Golgis" were functionally active because they were reversibly disrupted by the membrane trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A. However, the drug had no visible effect if the oocytes had been previously microinjected with GTP-gamma-S. During in vitro maturation the large Golgi apparatus structures fragmented at germinal vesicle breakdown, and dispersed homogenously throughout the ooplasm, remaining in a fragmented state in metaphase-II oocytes. Similarly to what has been reported using protein synthesis inhibitors, the presence of brefeldin A blocked maturation at the germinal vesicle breakdown stage before the assembly of the metaphase-I spindle. These results suggest that progression of murine oocyte maturation may require functional membrane trafficking.

11297925|a|Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that assemble from alpha/beta-tubulin and are vital for the establishment of cell polarity, vesicle trafficking and formation of the mitotic/meiotic spindle. gamma-Tubulin, a protein related to alpha/beta-tubulin, is required for initiating the polymerization of microtubules in vivo. gamma-Tubulin has been found in two main protein complexes: the gamma-tubulin ring complex and its subunit, the gamma-tubulin small complex. The latter is analogous to the yeast Tub4 complex. In the past year, important advances have been made in understanding the structure and function of the gamma-tubulin ring complex and how it interacts with microtubules.

14675420|a|Microtubules are essential for many aspects of polarity in multicellular organisms, ranging from the asymmetric distribution of cell-fate determinants in the one-cell embryo to the transient polarity generated in migrating fibroblasts. Epithelial cells exhibit permanent cell polarity characterized by apical and basolateral surface domains of distinct protein and lipid composition that are segregated by tight junctions. They are also endowed with a microtubule network that reflects the asymmetry of their cell surface: microtubule minus-ends face the apical- and microtubule plus-ends the basal domain. Strikingly, the formation of distinct surface domains during epithelial differentiation is accompanied by the re-organization of microtubules from a uniform array focused at the centrosome to the noncentrosomal network that aligns along the apico-basolateral polarity axis. The significance of this coincidence for epithelial morphogenesis and the signaling mechanisms that drive microtubule repolymerization in developing epithelia remain major unresolved questions that we are only beginning to address. Studies in cultured polarized epithelial cells have established that microtubules serve as tracks that facilitate targeted vesicular transport. Novel findings suggest, moreover, that microtubule-based transport promotes protein sorting, and even the generation of transport carriers in the endo- and exocytic pathways.

12706117|a|In the present study, we analyze multinuclear osteoclasts obtained from several avian and mammalian species and describe the reorganization of their microtubular architecture and Golgi complex orientation during osteoclast differentiation and activation for bone resorption. In nonresorbing quail and chicken multinuclear osteoclasts, microtubules radiate from multiple centrosomal microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs), whose number is equal to the number of nuclei. However, centrosomal MTOCs disappear at the time of cell activation for bone resorption and the Golgi membranes redistribute to circumscribe nuclei. In contrast to avian osteoclasts, both resorbing and nonresorbing rat, rabbit, and human osteoclasts have no or few centrosomal MTOCs. Instead, after cold-induced depolymerization, regrowing microtubules nucleate from the perinuclear area where immunofluoresce and immunoelectron scanning microscopy reveal pericentriolar matrix protein pericentrin associated with vimentin filaments. Furthermore, the circumnuclear reorganization of MTOCs and the Golgi is a result of mammalian osteoclast maturation and occur before any resorptive activity of the mononuclear osteoclasts and their fusion into multinucleated cells. Our results show that unlike previously suggested, the nuclear surfaces of mammalian osteoclasts act as the microtubule anchoring sites similarly to nuclear surfaces in multinucleated myotubes and suggest the role of perinuclear intermediate filament network in orchestrating the microtubular cytoskeleton.

1436071|a|Complex microtubule assemblies are essential components of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. They are extremely stable and are not affected by agents that normally induce polymer disassembly. The molecular basis of this microtubular stability is unknown, and it is not related to any feature of the constitutive tubulin. In sea urchin sperm flagella, axonemal microtubules are found to be stabilized by a protein identical to histone H1, a result that defines a new role for this histone and provides evidence for a concerted evolution of chromatin and microtubular structures.

12045224|a|We examined the relationship between the spindle orientation and the determination site of cytokinesis in brown algal cells using polyspermic zygotes of Scytosiphon lomentaria. When two male gametes fuse with one female gamete, the zygote has two pairs of centrioles derived from male gametes and three chloroplasts from two male and one female gametes. Just before mitosis, two pairs of centrioles duplicate and migrate towards the future mitotic poles. Spindle MTs develop and three or four spindle poles are formed. In a tri-polar spindle, one pair of centrioles shifts away from the spindle, otherwise, two pairs of centrioles exist adjoining at one spindle pole. Chromosomes arrange at several equators of the spindle. As a result of these multipolar mitoses, three or four daughter nuclei developed. Subsequently, these daughter nuclei form a line along the long axis of the cell. Cell partition always takes place between daughter nuclei, perpendicular to the long axis of the cell. Three or four daughter cells are produced by cytokinesis. Some of the daughter cells after cytokinesis do not have a nucleus, but all of them always contain the centrosome and chloroplast. Therefore, the number of daughter cells always coincides with the number of centrosomes or microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). These results show that the cytokinetic plane in the brown algae is determined by the position of centrosomes after mitosis and is not dependent on the spindle position.

The ASR requires Wsc membrane proteins that are trapped along the secretory path, rather than those which are at the plasma membrane. The activity of the downstream kinase, Pkc1p, is also required; however, the Pkc1p MAP kinase cascade is not. sec mutants initiate compensatory transcriptional changes distinct from those of the unfolded protein response.

12456727|a|The small GTPase Ran is the central regulator of macromolecular transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Recent work has suggested that RanGTP also plays an important role in regulating some intra-nuclear processes. In this study, we have investigated whether RanGTP is required for the intra-nuclear transport of RNAs. Specifically, we directly analyzed the nucleolar localization of Box C/D and Box H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in mammalian (tsBN2) cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus oocytes under conditions that deplete nuclear RanGTP and prevent RNA export to the cytoplasm. Our data suggest that depletion of nuclear RanGTP does not significantly alter the nucleolar localization of U3 snoRNA in tsBN2 cells. Complementary studies in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae using conditional Ran mutants as well as mutants in Ran regulatory proteins also indicate that disruption of the Ran gradient or of Ran itself does not detectably affect the nucleolar localization of snoRNAs. Finally, microinjection into Xenopus oocytes was used to clearly demonstrate that a specific pool of snoRNAs could still be efficiently targeted to the nucleolus even when the RanGTP gradient was disrupted by microinjection of mutant Ran proteins. Taken together, our data from three phylogenetically distinct experimental systems suggest that nuclear RanGTP, which is essential for trafficking of RNAs between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, is not required for nuclear retention or nucleolar localization of snoRNAs.

12796288|a|Spore formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs via the de novo synthesis of the prospore membrane during the second meiotic division. Prospore membrane formation is triggered by assembly of a membrane-organizing center, the meiotic outer plaque (MOP), on the cytoplasmic face of the spindle pole body (SPB) during meiosis. We report here the identification of two new components of the MOP, Ady4p and Spo74p. Ady4p and Spo74p interact with known proteins of the MOP and are localized to the outer plaque of the SPB during meiosis II. MOP assembly and prospore membrane formation are abolished in spo74Delta/spo74Delta cells and occur aberrantly in ady4Delta/ady4Delta cells. Spo74p and the MOP component Mpc70p are mutually dependent for recruitment to SPBs during meiosis. In contrast, both Ady4p and Spo74p are present at SPBs, albeit at reduced levels, in cells that lack the MOP component Mpc54p. Our findings suggest a model for the assembled MOP in which Mpc54p, Mpc70p, and Spo74p make up a core structural unit of the scaffold that initiates synthesis of the prospore membrane, and Ady4p is an auxiliary component that stabilizes the plaque.

2649796|a|Microtubules, which are essential for mitosis and many other cytoskeletal functions, are composed primarily of alpha- and beta-tubulin. The properties of microtubules are due, in part, to proteins other than tubulins that are part of, or interact with, microtubules and the identification and characterization of such proteins is important to understanding how microtubules function. Analyses of mutations at the mipA (microtubule interacting protein) locus of Aspergillus nidulans have suggested that the product of mipA interacts specifically, probably physically, with beta-tubulin in vivo and is involved in microtubule function. We have cloned and sequenced the wild-type mipA gene as well as complementary DNA copies of its messenger RNA. Comparisons of the predicted product of mipA with tubulins from diverse organisms reveal that mipA is a previously undiscovered member of the tubulin superfamily of genes; the only member yet discovered that does not encode alpha- or beta-tubulin. We propose that the product of mipA be called gamma-tubulin.

9247191|a|Both the nucleus and the centrosome are complex, dynamic structures whose architectures undergo cell cycle-specific rearrangements. CP190 and CP60 are two Drosophila proteins of unknown function that shuttle between centrosomes and nuclei in a cell cycle-dependent manner. These two proteins are associated in vitro, and localize to centrosomes in a microtubule independent manner. We injected fluorescently labeled, bacterially expressed CP190 and CP60 into living Drosophila embryos and followed their behavior during the rapid syncytial blastoderm divisions (nuclear cycles 10-13). Using quantitative 3-D wide-field fluorescence microscopy, we show that CP190 and CP60 cycle between nuclei and centrosomes asynchronously with the accumulation of CP190 leading that of CP60 both at centrosomes and in nuclei. During interphase, CP190 is found in nuclei. Immediately following nuclear envelope breakdown, CP190 localizes to centrosomes where it remains until telophase, thereafter accumulating in reforming nuclei. Unlike CP190, CP60 accumulates at centrosomes primarily during anaphase, where it remains into early interphase. During nuclear cycles 10 and 11, CP60 accumulates in nuclei simultaneous with nuclear envelope breakdown, suggesting that CP60 binds to an unknown nuclear structure that persists into mitosis. During nuclear cycles 12 and 13, CP60 accumulates gradually in nuclei during interphase, reaching peak levels just before nuclear envelope breakdown. Once in the nucleus, both CP190 and CP60 appear to form fibrous intranuclear networks that remain coherent even after nuclear envelope breakdown. The CP190 and CP60 networks do not co-localize extensively with each other or with DNA. This work provides direct evidence, in living cells, of a coherent protein network that may represent a nuclear skeleton.

12045110|a|The existence and function of actin in the nucleus has been hotly debated for forty years. Recently, beta-actin was found to be a component of mammalian SWI/SNF-like BAF chromatin remodeling complexes and still more recently other SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complexes in yeast, flies, and man. Although the function of actin in these chromatin remodeling complexes is only starting to be explored, the fact that actin is one of the most regulated proteins in the cell suggests that control of nuclear actin may be a critical regulatory point in the control of chromatin remodeling. Actin rapidly shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm offering additional sites and modes of regulation. In addition, actin-related proteins (Arps) are also components of these chromatin remodeling complexes and have been implicated in transcriptional control in yeast. The observation that the BAF chromatin remodeling complex in which actin was originally identified, is also a human tumor suppressor complex necessary for the actions of the retinoblastoma protein indicates that the study of nuclear actin is likely to contribute to understanding cell growth control.

11337398|a|The endosperm develops from the central cell of the megagametophyte after introduction of the second male gamete into the diploid central cell. Of the three forms of endosperm in angiosperms, the nuclear type is prevalent in economically important species, including the cereals. Landmarks in nuclear endosperm development are the coenocytic, cellularization, differentiation, and maturation stages. The differentiated endosperm contains four major cell types: starchy endosperm, aleurone, transfer cells, and the cells of the embryo surrounding region. Recent research has demonstrated that the first two phases of endosperm occur via mechanisms that are conserved among all groups of angiosperms, involving directed nuclear migration during the coenocytic stage and anticlinal cell wall deposition by cytoplasmic phragmoplasts formed in interzones between radial microtubular systems emanating from nuclear membranes. Complete cellularization of the endosperm coenocyte is achieved through centripetal growth of cell files, extending to the center of the endosperm cavity. Key points in cell cycle control and control of the MT (microtubular) cytoskeletal apparatus central to endosperm development are discussed. Specification of cell fates in the cereal endosperm appears to occur via positional signaling; cells in peripheral positions, except over the main vascular tissues, assume aleurone cell fate. Cells over the main vascular tissue become transfer cells and all interior cells become starchy endosperm cells. Studies in maize have implicated Crinkly4, a protein receptor kinase-like molecule, in aleurone cell fate specification.

Contractions evoked by wounding partition the cytoplasm into hundreds of spherical protoplasts with approximately 40 percent less total plasma-membrane surface area than the original cell.

10852938|a|Cell wall formation in the syncytial endosperm of Arabidopsis was studied by using high-pressure-frozen/freeze-substituted developing seeds and immunocytochemical techniques. The endosperm cellularization process begins at the late globular embryo stage with the synchronous organization of small clusters of oppositely oriented microtubules ( approximately 10 microtubules in each set) into phragmoplast-like structures termed mini-phragmoplasts between both sister and nonsister nuclei. These mini-phragmoplasts produce a novel kind of cell plate, the syncytial-type cell plate, from Golgi-derived vesicles approximately 63 nm in diameter, which fuse by way of hourglass-shaped intermediates into wide ( approximately 45 nm in diameter) tubules. These wide tubules quickly become coated and surrounded by a ribosome-excluding matrix; as they grow, they branch and fuse with each other to form wide tubular networks. The mini-phragmoplasts formed between a given pair of nuclei produce aligned tubular networks that grow centrifugally until they merge into a coherent wide tubular network with the mini-phragmoplasts positioned along the network margins. The individual wide tubular networks expand laterally until they meet and eventually fuse with each other at the sites of the future cell corners. Transformation of the wide tubular networks into noncoated, thin ( approximately 27 nm in diameter) tubular networks begins at multiple sites and coincides with the appearance of clathrin-coated budding structures. After fusion with the syncytial cell wall, the thin tubular networks are converted into fenestrated sheets and cell walls. Immunolabeling experiments show that the cell plates and cell walls of the endosperm differ from those of the embryo and maternal tissue in two features: their xyloglucans lack terminal fucose residues on the side chain, and callose persists in the cell walls after the cell plates fuse with the parental plasma membrane. The lack of terminal fucose residues on xyloglucans suggests that these cell wall matrix molecules serve both structural and storage functions.

14610676|a|The mechanism of cell wall formation after male meiosis was studied in microsporocytes of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. by means of thin-section and immuno-electron microscopy and dual-axis electron tomography of high-pressure-frozen/freeze-substituted cells. The cellularization of four-nucleate microsporocytes involves a novel type of cell plate, called a post-meiotic-type cell plate. As in the syncytial endosperm, the microsporocyte cell plates assemble in association with mini-phragmoplasts. However, in contrast to the endosperm cell plates, post-meiotic type cell plates arise simultaneously across the entire division plane. Vesicles are transported along mini-phragmoplast microtubules by putative kinesin proteins and, prior to fusion, they become connected together by 24-nm-long linkers that resemble exocyst complexes. These vesicles fuse with each other to form wide tubules and wide tubular networks. In contrast to endosperm cell plates, the wide tubular networks in microsporocytes completely lack callose and do not appear to be constricted by dynamin rings. The most peripheral wide tubular networks begin to fuse with the plasma membrane before the more central cell plate assembly sites become integrated into a coherent cell plate. Fusion with the parental plasma membrane triggers callose synthesis and the wide tubular domains are converted into convoluted sheets. As the peripheral convoluted sheets accumulate callose and arabinogalactan proteins, they are converted into stub-like projections, which grow centripetally, i.e. toward the interior of the syncytium, fusing with the wide tubular networks already assembled in the division plane. We also demonstrate that the ribosome-excluding cell plate assembly matrix is delivered to the mini-phragmoplast with the first vesicles, and encompasses all the linked vesicles and intermediate stages in cell plate formation.

16668259|a|The unusual nature of protoplasm to generate subprotoplasts spontaneously from disintegrated Bryopsis cells was examined. Protoplasm extruded from algal cells aggregated rapidly in cell sap which was derived mainly from huge central vacuoles of the cells. Electron microscopic observations revealed extensive agglutination of algal cellular membranes in the protoplasmic masses, suggesting that this is of primary importance for the wound-healing ability of the alga. Seawater caused spheration of the resultant protoplasmic aggregates. Gelatinous sheaths were formed temporarily surrounding the spherical protoplasmic masses before reformation of cell membrane. Staining with phosphotungstic and chromic acids suggested that new cell membrane was formed by fusion of the disintegrated original cell membrane with cytoplasmic vesicles on the surfaces of the protoplasmic masses. Both pH and salts were found to be essentially important at the two steps of subprotoplast generation. The newly formed cell membranes were responsible for subsequent notable plasmolysis of the wounded cells in seawater. Thus, it is suggested that unicellular marine algae Bryopsis spp. naturally contain effective materials for agglutinating and fusing particular cellular membranes through the sequential aid of acidic cell sap and alkaline seawater after disintegration of the giant cells.

The pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri, which undergo actin-based propulsion, are acknowledged models of the leading edge of lamellipodia. Actin-based motility of the bacteria or of functionalized microspheres can be reconstituted in vitro from only five pure proteins. Movement results from the regulated site-directed treadmilling of actin filaments, consistent with observations of actin dynamics in living motile cells and with the biochemical properties of the components of the synthetic motility medium.

10371020|a|Reaction-diffusion processes can lead to a macroscopic concentration pattern from an initially homogeneous solution, and thus provide a physical-chemical mechanism for biological pattern formation and morphogenesis. The central prediction of reaction-diffusion theory is that the patterns contain periodic concentration variations in some of the reactives. Microtubules assembled in vitro spontaneously self-organise and form stationary striped macroscopic structures. In agreement with reaction-diffusion theory. Here we show, in agreement with reaction-diffusion theory, that these preparations contain substantial microtubule concentration variations. Similar striped microtubule patterns arise during Drosophila embryogenesis. A characteristic of these patterns is their dependence on sample dimensions. In Drosophila eggs shortened by ligation, we found that the microtubule pattern varied with egg fragment length in the same way as the in vitro microtubule pattern varied with sample length, and as expected from theory. This is evidence that reaction-diffusion structures occur during Drosophila morphogenesis.

To investigate how self-organization depends on gravity, microtubules were assembled under low gravity conditions produced during space flight.

12429613|a|Arf proteins are important regulators of cellular traffic and the founding members of an expanding family of homologous proteins and genomic sequences. They depart from other small GTP-binding proteins by a unique structural device, which we call the 'interswitch toggle', that implements front-back communication from the N-terminus to the nucleotide binding site. Here we define the sequence and structural determinants that propagate information across the protein and identify them in all of the Arf family proteins other than Arl6 and Arl4/Arl7. The positions of these determinants lead us to propose that Arf family members with the interswitch toggle device are activated by a bipartite mechanism acting on opposite sides of the protein. The presence of this communication device might provide a more useful basis for unifying Arf homologs as a family than do the cellular functions of these proteins, which are mostly unrelated. We review available genomic sequences and functional data from this perspective, and identify a novel subfamily that we call Arl8.

12490148|a|Actin is an abundant protein in most nonmuscle cells. It has often been observed in isolated nuclei, yet cytoplasmic contamination was of course initially regarded as the most plausible origin. Numerous studies on nuclear actin appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, but the picture remained rather muddy. The viewpoint at that time was that actin-shown to move freely between cytoplasm and nucleus-was a mere "thermodynamic wanderer," transiently occupying the nucleus. More recently, evidence has been mounting that actin's presence in the nucleus is not simply governed by the laws of diffusion. The same holds true for the finding of various actin-related proteins in the nucleus, and the case for nuclear myosin, specifically myosin I, is now quite convincing. Moreover, the first intimations of functional roles of nuclear actin are now emerging. Here we examine the overall subject from cell biological and chemical perspectives. The major issue is no longer the presence of actin in the nucleus but rather its supramolecular organization, intranuclear locations, and, of course, functions. These issues interface with recent findings that reveal a surprisingly diverse repertoire of actin conformations and oligomer and polymer forms beyond monomeric G-actin and polymeric F-actin. We present ideas for advancing the nuclear actin field and call for a renewed attack on this major problem in cell biology.

Although here only Euplotidium itoi and Euplotidium arenarium from tide pools along a rocky shore near Leghorn (Ligurian sea) were studied in detail, these epibionts are certainly present on specimens of E. itoi and on other Euplotidium species in similar north coastal habitats. The complex life history of epixenosomes has two main stages. In stage I, cells with typical prokaryotic structure divide by binary fission. Stage II cells show complex organization with different cytoplasmic compartments where an extrusive apparatus within a proteinaceous matrix, although not membrane-bounded, differs from the remaining cytoplasm. The ejection process is involved in defense; extrusive apparatus is surrounded by a basket consisting of bundles of tubules. These tubules, 22 +/- 3 nm in diameter, delimited by a wall made up of globular structures, are sensitive to inhibitor of tubulin polymerization (nocodazole/4 degrees C temperature) and react positively with different antitubulin antibodies, two of which are monoclonal. The prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic nature of epixenosomes was resolved by comparative sequence analysis of amplified small subunit rRNA genes and in situ hybridization with fluorescently labeled rRNA-targeted polynucleotide probes. These unique ectosymbionts are phylogenetically related to Verrucomicrobia. Epixenosomes represent marine symbionts in this recently discovered division of the Bacteria.

21680355|a|The unique cytokinetic apparatus of higher plant cells comprises two cytoskeletal systems: a predictive preprophase band of microtubules (MTs), which defines the future division site, and the phragmoplast, which mediates crosswall formation after mitosis. We review features of plant cell division in an evolutionary context and from the viewpoint that the cell is a domain of cytoplasm (cytoplast) organized around the nucleus by a cytoskeleton consisting of a single "tensegral" unit. The term "tensegrity" is a contraction of "tensional integrity" and the concept proposes that the whole cell is organized by an integrated cytoskeleton of tension elements (e.g., actin fibers) extended over compression-resistant elements (e.g., MTs).During cell division, a primary role of the spindle is seen as generating two cytoplasts from one with separation of chromosomes a later, derived function. The telophase spindle separates the newly forming cytoplasts and the overlap between half spindles (the shared edge of two new domains) dictates the position at which cytokinesis occurs. Wall MTs of higher plant cells, like the MT cytoskeleton in animal and protistan cells, spatially define the interphase cytoplast. Redeployment of actin and MTs into the preprophase band (PPB) is the overt signal that the boundary between two nascent cytoplasts has been delineated. The "actin-depleted zone" that marks the site of the PPB throughout mitosis may be a more persistent manifestation of this delineation of two domains of cortical actin. The growth of the phragmoplast is controlled by these domains, not just by the spindle. These domains play a major role in controlling the path of phragmoplast expansion. Primitive land plants show different morphological changes that reveal that the plane of division, with or without the PPB, has been determined well in advance of mitosis.The green alga Spirogyra suggests how the phragmoplast system might have evolved: cytokinesis starts with cleavage and then actin-related determinants stimulate and positionally control cell-plate formation in a phragmoplast arising from interzonal MTs from the spindle. Actin in the PPB of higher plants may be assembling into a potential furrow, imprinting a cleavage site whose persistent determinants (perhaps actin) align the outgrowing edge of the phragmoplast, as in Spirogyra. Cytochalasin spatially disrupts polarized mitosis and positioning of the phragmoplast. Thus, the tensegral interaction of actin with MTs (at the spindle pole and in the phragmoplast) is critical to morphogenesis, just as they seem to be during division of animal cells. In advanced green plants, intercalary expansion driven by turgor is controlled by MTs, which in conjunction with actin, may act as stress detectors, thereby affecting the plane of division (a response clearly evident after wounding of tissue). The PPB might be one manifestation of this strain detection apparatus.

Investigating the behavior of the centrosome in living mitotic cells, we documented a transient and remarkable postanaphase repositioning of this organelle, which apparently controls the release of central microtubules from the midbody and the completion of cell division. We also observed that the absence of the centrosome leads to defects in cytokinesis. Together with recent results in yeasts, our data point to a conserved centrosome-dependent pathway that integrates spatial controls into the decision of completing cell division, which requires the repositioning of the centrosome organelle.

14747658|a|Understanding how cells regulate microtubule nucleation during the cell cycle has been limited by the inability to directly observe nucleation from the centrosome. To view nucleation in living cells, we imaged GFP-tagged EB1, a microtubule tip-binding protein, and determined rates of nucleation by counting the number of EB1-GFP comets emerging from the centrosome over time. Nucleation rate increased 4-fold between G(2) and prophase and continued to rise through anaphase and telophase, reaching a maximum of 7 times interphase rates. We tested several models for centrosome maturation, including gamma-tubulin recruitment and increased centrosome size. The centrosomal concentration of gamma-tubulin reached a maximum at metaphase, and centrosome size increased through anaphase, whereas nucleation remained high through telophase, implying the presence of additional regulatory processes. Injection of anti-gamma-tubulin antibodies significantly blocked nucleation during metaphase but was less effective during anaphase, suggesting that a nucleation mechanism independent of gamma-tubulin contributes to centrosome function after metaphase.

10417699|a|Cold elicits an immediate rise in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c) of plant cells. We have studied the concerted action of the three underlying mechanisms, namely sensing, sensitisation and desensitisation, which become important when plants in the field are subjected to changes in temperature. We applied different regimes of temperature changes with well-defined cooling rates to intact roots of Arabidopsis thaliana expressing the calcium-indicator, aequorin. Our results indicate that temperature sensing is mainly dependent on the cooling rate, dT/dt, whereas the absolute temperature T is of less importance. Arabidopsis roots were found to be sensitive to cooling rates of less than dT/dt = 0.01 degrees C/s. However, at cooling rates below 0.003 degrees C/s (i.e. cooling 10 degrees C in 1 h) there is no detectable [Ca2+]c response at all. At low temperature, the sensitivity of the plant cold-detection system is increased. This in turn produces greater cooling-induced [Ca2+]c elevations. Prolonged or repeated cold treatment attenuates the [Ca2+]c responses to subsequent episodes of cooling.

A core set of proteins including actin, Arp2/3 complex, profilin, capping protein, and ADF/cofilin can reconstitute the process in vitro, and mathematical models of the constituent reactions predict the rate of motion. Signaling pathways converging on WASp/Scar proteins regulate the activity of Arp2/3 complex, which mediates the initiation of new filaments as branches on preexisting filaments. After a brief spurt of growth, capping protein terminates the elongation of the filaments. After filaments have aged by hydrolysis of their bound ATP and dissociation of the gamma phosphate, ADF/cofilin proteins promote debranching and depolymerization. Profilin catalyzes the exchange of ADP for ATP, refilling the pool of ATP-actin monomers bound to profilin, ready for elongation.

In Part I of this two-part commentary, presented in the previous issue of Journal of Cell Science, we discussed the basis by which yeast establishes and maintains different states of polarity through &Rgr; GTPases and cyclin-dependent protein kinase signaling. Here we discuss how, in response to those signals, the actin cytoskeleton guides growth of the yeast cell. A polarized array of actin cables at the cell cortex is the primary structural determinant of polarity. Motors such as class V myosins use this array to transport secretory vesicles, mRNA and organelles towards growth sites, where they are anchored by a cap of cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins. Cortical actin patches enhance and maintain this polarity, probably through endocytic recycling, which allows reuse of materials and prevents continued growth at old sites. The dynamic arrangement of targeting and recycling provides flexibility for the precise control of morphogenesis.

12689592|a|Halving of the chromosome number during meiosis I depends on the segregation of maternal and paternal centromeres. This process relies on the attachment of sister centromeres to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole. We describe here the identification of a protein complex, Csm1/Lrs4, that is essential for monoorientation of sister kinetochores in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both proteins are present in vegetative cells, where they reside in the nucleolus. Only shortly before meiosis I do they leave the nucleolus and form a "monopolin" complex with the meiosis-specific Mam1 protein, which binds to kinetochores. Surprisingly, Csm1's homolog in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Pcs1, is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis II. Csm1 and Pcs1 might clamp together microtubule binding sites on the same (Pcs1) or sister (Csm1) kinetochores.

12963707|a|Here, we report on the identification of nucleolar spindle-associated protein (NuSAP), a novel 55-kD vertebrate protein with selective expression in proliferating cells. Its mRNA and protein levels peak at the transition of G2 to mitosis and abruptly decline after cell division. Microscopic analysis of both fixed and live mammalian cells showed that NuSAP is primarily nucleolar in interphase, and localizes prominently to central spindle microtubules during mitosis. Direct interaction of NuSAP with microtubules was demonstrated in vitro. Overexpression of NuSAP caused profound bundling of cytoplasmic microtubules in interphase cells, and this relied on a COOH-terminal microtubule-binding domain. In contrast, depletion of NuSAP by RNA interference resulted in aberrant mitotic spindles, defective chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. In addition, many NuSAP-depleted interphase cells had deformed nuclei. Both overexpression and knockdown of NuSAP impaired cell proliferation. These results suggest a crucial role for NuSAP in spindle microtubule organization.

Little is known of the organization, in muscle in vivo, of the subcellular organelles involved in protein synthesis despite the potential importance of targeted protein synthesis for formation and maintenance of functional domains such as the neuromuscular junction. A panel of antibodies to markers of the ER, the Golgi complex, and the centrosome were used to localize these organelles by immunofluorescence in myoblasts and myotubes of the mouse muscle cell line C2 in vitro, and in intact single muscle fibers from the rat flexor digitorum brevis. Antibodies to the ER stained structures throughout the cytoplasm of both C2 myoblasts and myotubes. In contrast, the spatial relationship between nucleus, centrosome, and Golgi complex was dramatically altered. These changes could also be observed in a low-calcium medium that allowed differentiation while preventing myoblast fusion. Muscle fibers in vivo resembled myotubes except that the ER occupied a smaller volume of cytoplasm and no staining was found for one of the Golgi complex markers, the enzyme alpha-mannosidase II. Electron microscopy, however, clearly showed the presence of stacks of Golgi cisternae in both junctional and extrajunctional regions of muscle fibers. The perinuclear distribution of the Golgi complex was also observed in live muscle fibers stained with a fluorescent lipid. Thus, the distribution of subcellular organelles of the secretory pathway was found to be similar in myotubes and muscle fibers, and all organelles were found in both junctional and extrajunctional areas of muscle.

11157074|a|The Golgi complex of skeletal muscle fibers is made of thousands of dispersed elements. The distributions of these elements and of the microtubules they associate with differ in fast compared with slow and in innervated compared with denervated fibers. To investigate the role of muscle impulse activity, we denervated fast extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and slow soleus (SOL) muscles of adult rats and stimulated them directly with patterns that resemble the impulse patterns of normal fast EDL (25 pulses at 150 Hz every 15 min) and slow SOL (200 pulses at 20 Hz every 30 sec) motor units. After 2 weeks of denervation plus stimulation, peripheral and central regions of muscle fibers were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy with regard to density and distribution of Golgi complex, microtubules, glucose transporter GLUT4, centrosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum exit sites. In extrajunctional regions, fast pattern stimulation preserved normal fast characteristics of all markers in EDL type IIB/IIX fibers, although inducing changes toward the fast phenotype in originally slow type I SOL fibers, such as a 1.5-fold decrease of the density of Golgi elements at the fiber surface. Slow pattern stimulation had converse effects such as a 2.2-fold increase of the density of Golgi elements at the EDL fiber surface. In junctional regions, where fast and slow fibers are similar, both stimulation patterns prevented a denervation-induced accumulation of GLUT4. The results indicate that patterns of muscle impulse activity, as normally imposed by motor neurons, play a major role in regulating the organization of Golgi complex and related proteins in the extrajunctional region of muscle fibers.

Kim et al.1 have recently shown the extraordinary wound-repair and propagation mechanism of one such siphonous green alga--Bryopsis plumosa. Nucleocytoplasmic aggregates, which are released after injury to this plant, are membraneless structures that can survive in seawater for 10-20 minutes, before they are surrounded by a gelatinous envelope. Subsequently, a cell membrane and cell wall are synthesized around each of these aggregates and the resulting individual cells, so formed, develop into new plants. This report represents a significant advance in our understanding of wound response and, more significantly, is probably the first example of transient survival of life without a cell membrane!

Elevation in intracellular [Ca(2+)] triggers fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane, a process regulated by the lysosomal synaptotagmin isoform Syt VII. Here, we show that Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis of lysosomes is required for the repair of plasma membrane disruptions. Lysosomal exocytosis and membrane resealing are inhibited by the recombinant Syt VII C(2)A domain or anti-Syt VII C(2)A antibodies, or by antibodies against the cytosolic domain of Lamp-1, which specifically aggregate lysosomes. We further demonstrate that lysosomal exocytosis mediates the resealing of primary skin fibroblasts wounded during the contraction of collagen matrices. These findings reveal a fundamental, novel role for lysosomes: as Ca(2+)-regulated exocytic compartments responsible for plasma membrane repair.

We have cloned a complete cDNA of Dictyostelium EB1 (DdEB1), the largest known EB1 homolog (57 kDa). Immunofluorescence analysis and expression of a green fluorescent protein-DdEB1 fusion protein revealed that DdEB1 localizes along microtubules, at microtubule tips, centrosomes, and protruding pseudopods. During mitosis, it was found at the spindle, spindle poles, and kinetochores. DdEB1 is the first EB1-homolog that is also a genuine centrosomal component, because it was localized at isolated centrosomes that are free of microtubules. Furthermore, centrosomal DdEB1 distribution was unaffected by nocodazole treatment. DdEB1 colocalized with DdCP224, the XMAP215 homolog, at microtubule tips, the centrosome, and kinetochores. Furthermore, both proteins were part of the same cytosolic protein complex, suggesting that they may act together in their functions. DdEB1 deletion mutants expressed as green fluorescent protein or maltose-binding fusion proteins indicated that microtubule binding requires homo-oligomerization, which is mediated by a coiled-coil domain. A DdEB1 null mutant was viable but retarded in prometaphase progression due to a defect in spindle formation.

9683624|a|The mechanisms underlying two types of microtubule-dependent nuclear positioning are discussed. 'MTOC-dependent nuclear positioning' occurs when a nucleus is tightly associated with a microtubule organizing center (MTOC). 'Nuclear tracking along microtubules' is analogous to the motor-driven motility of other organelles and occurs when the nucleus lacks an associated MTOC. These two basic types of microtubule-dependent nuclear positioning may cooperate in many proliferating animal cells to achieve proper nuclear positioning. Microtubule polymerization and dynamics, motor proteins, MAPs and specialized sites such as cortical anchors function to control nuclear movements within cells.

9656480|a|The phylogenies for each of the protein-coding genes from the Methanococcus jannaschii genome were surveyed to determine the history of the major groups of life. For each gene, homologous sequences from other archaea, eucarya, and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were collected and aligned, and a phylogeny was reconstructed with a maximum-likelihood algorithm. The majority of significant phylogenies favor the eucarya and the archaca as sister groups. A smaller, but still substantial, portion of these significant phylogenies favor an eucarya/Gram-negative clade. These results indicate that support for the early history of life is not unequivocal. A chimeric origin of eukaryotes or an ancient, massive horizontal transfer of genes from Gram-negative bacteria to eucarya can explain many of the observed phylogenies.

11350626|a|Rho proteins are well known for their effects on the actin cytoskeleton, and are activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. Several Rho family members are localized to vesicular compartments, and increasing evidence suggests that they play important roles in the trafficking of vesicles on both endocytic and exocytic pathways. In particular, RhoA, RhoB, RhoD, Rac and Cdc42 have been shown to affect various steps of membrane trafficking. The underlying molecular basis for these effects of Rho proteins are incompletely understood, but in the case of Cdc42 it appears that it can drive vesicle movement through Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization at the surface of the vesicle. This is similar to what is believed to happen when Rac and Cdc42 stimulate actin polymerization at the plasma membrane. Rho proteins may also affect membrane trafficking by altering phosphatidylinositide composition of membrane compartments, or through interactions with microtubules.

For years, the functions of the centrosome were thought to revolve around its ability to nucleate and organize the various microtubule arrays seen in interphase and mitosis. But the centrosome is more than just a microtubule-organizing center. Recent work reveals that this organelle is essential for cell-cycle progression and that this requirement is independent of its ability to organize microtubules. Here, we review the various functions attributed to the centrosome and ask which are essential for the survival and reproduction of the cell, the organism, or both.

9062188|a|Fish melanophore cells aggregate pigment granules at the centre or redisperse them throughout the cytoplasm. The granules move along radial microtubules by means of molecular motors. Cytoplasmic fragments of melanophores organize a radial array of microtubules and aggregate pigment at its centre. Here we report self-centring in microsurgically produced cytoplasmic fragments of black tetra melanophores. We observed rapid (10 min) formation of a radial microtubule array after stimulation of aggregation. Arrangement of microtubules in the fragments returned to random during pigment redispersion. Apparently, formation of the radial array does not depend on a pre-existing microtubule-organizing centre. The array did not form in granule-free fragments nor in fragments treated with inhibitors of the intracellular motor protein cytoplasmic dynein. We conclude that formation of the radial microtubule array is induced by directional motion of pigment granules along microtubules and present evidence that its position is defined by interaction of microtubules with the surface.

12213835|a|EB1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that localizes to the plus ends of growing microtubules. In yeast, the EB1 homologue (BIM1) has been shown to modulate microtubule dynamics and link microtubules to the cortex, but the functions of metazoan EB1 proteins remain unknown. Using a novel preparation of the Drosophila S2 cell line that promotes cell attachment and spreading, we visualized dynamics of single microtubules in real time and found that depletion of EB1 by RNA-mediated inhibition (RNAi) in interphase cells causes a dramatic increase in nondynamic microtubules (neither growing nor shrinking), but does not alter overall microtubule organization. In contrast, several defects in microtubule organization are observed in RNAi-treated mitotic cells, including a drastic reduction in astral microtubules, malformed mitotic spindles, defocused spindle poles, and mispositioning of spindles away from the cell center. Similar phenotypes were observed in mitotic spindles of Drosophila embryos that were microinjected with anti-EB1 antibodies. In addition, live cell imaging of mitosis in Drosophila embryos reveals defective spindle elongation and chromosomal segregation during anaphase after antibody injection. Our results reveal crucial roles for EB1 in mitosis, which we postulate involves its ability to promote the growth and interactions of microtubules within the central spindle and at the cell cortex.

1469054|a|Multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers are compartmentalized with respect to the expression and organization of several intracellular and cell surface proteins including acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Mosaic muscle fibers formed from homozygous myoblasts expressing two allelic variants of AChE preferentially translate and assemble the polypeptides in the vicinity of the nucleus encoding the mRNA (Rotundo, R. L. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 110:715-719). To determine whether the locally synthesized AChE molecules are targeted to specific regions of the myotube surface, primary quail myoblasts were mixed with mononucleated cells of the mouse muscle C2/C12 cell line and allowed to fuse, forming heterospecific mosaic myotubes. Cell surface enzyme was localized by immunofluorescence using an avian AChE-specific monoclonal antibody. HOECHST 33342 was used to distinguish between quail and mouse nuclei in myotubes. Over 80% of the quail nuclei exhibited clusters of cell surface AChE in mosaic quail-mouse myotubes, whereas only 4% of the mouse nuclei had adjacent quail AChE-positive regions of membrane, all of which were located next to a quail nucleus. In contrast, membrane proteins such as Na+/K+ ATPase, which are not restricted to specific regions of the myotube surface, are free to diffuse over the entire length of the fiber. These studies indicate that the AChE molecules expressed in multinucleated muscle fibers are preferentially transported and localized to regions of surface membrane overlying the nucleus of origin. This targeting could play an important role in establishing and maintaining specialized cell surface domains such as the neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions.

12654904|a|Here, we report the first evidence that the Ran GTPase cycle is required for nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly. Using a genetic approach, factors required for NPC assembly were identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Four mutant complementation groups were characterized that correspond to respective mutations in genes encoding Ran (gsp1), and essential Ran regulatory factors Ran GTPase-activating protein (rna1), Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (prp20), and the RanGDP import factor (ntf2). All the mutants showed temperature-dependent mislocalization of green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged nucleoporins (nups) and the pore-membrane protein Pom152. A decrease in GFP fluorescence associated with the nuclear envelope was observed along with an increase in the diffuse, cytoplasmic signal with GFP foci. The defects did not affect the stability of existing NPCs, and nup mislocalization was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and continued cell growth. Electron microscopy analysis revealed striking membrane perturbations and the accumulation of vesicles in arrested mutants. Using both biochemical fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy methods, these vesicles were shown to contain nups. We propose a model wherein a Ran-mediated vesicular fusion step is required for NPC assembly into intact nuclear envelopes.

We have analyzed the function of the stress-activated alfalfa MAP kinase SIMK in root hairs. In epidermal cells, SIMK is predominantly nuclear. During root hair formation, SIMK was activated and redistributed from the nucleus into growing tips of root hairs possessing dense F-actin meshworks. Actin depolymerization by latrunculin B resulted in SIMK relocation to the nucleus. Conversely, upon actin stabilization with jasplakinolide, SIMK co-localized with thick actin cables in the cytoplasm. Importantly, latrunculin B and jasplakinolide were both found to activate SIMK in a root-derived cell culture. Loss of tip-focused SIMK and actin was induced by the MAPK kinase inhibitor UO 126 and resulted in aberrant root hairs. UO 126 inhibited targeted vesicle trafficking and polarized growth of root hairs. In contrast, overexpression of gain-of-function SIMK induced rapid tip growth of root hairs and could bypass growth inhibition by UO 126. These data indicate that SIMK plays a crucial role in root hair tip growth.

12445267|a|The reorganization of membrane, cytoskeletal and signaling molecules during immune interactions is critical for the generation of immune response. At the initiation of the T cell-antigen presenting cell (APC) interaction, antigen-independent weak adhesion forces allow the scanning of the APC surface by the T cell receptor for specific antigens. The stabilization of T cell-APC conjugates involves the segregation of membrane and intracellular signaling proteins, driven by reorganization of membrane microdomains and cytoskeletal changes. In early T cell-APC cognate interactions, the microtubular cytoskeleton undergoes drastic changes that lead to microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) reorientation to the vicinity of the cell-cell contact area. Recent data on the dynamics of MTOC redistribution and its influence in T cell-APC conjugate stabilization, together with the description of an increasing number of signaling molecules associated to this complex, underscore the key role of MTOC translocation in the T cell response. We focus on the mechanisms that control the early MTOC reorientation during T cell-APC interaction and the relevance of this process to T cell activation.

7738110|a|The acidic carboxy-terminal regions of alpha- and beta-tubulin subunits are currently thought to be centrally involved in microtubule stability and in microtubule association with a variety of proteins (MAPs) such as MAP2 and tau proteins. Here, pure tubulin microtubules were exposed to subtilisin to produce polymers composed of cleaved tubulin subunits lacking carboxy termini. Polymer exposure to subtilisin was achieved in buffer conditions compatible with further tests of microtubule stability. Microtubules composed of normal alpha-tubulin and cleaved beta-tubulin were indistinguishable from control microtubules with regard to resistance to dilution-induced disassembly, to cold temperature-induced disassembly and to Ca(2+)-induced disassembly. Microtubules composed of cleaved alpha- and beta-tubulins showed normal sensitivity to dilution-induced disassembly and to low temperature-induced disassembly, but marked resistance to Ca(2+)-induced disassembly. Polymers composed of normal alpha-tubulin and cleaved beta-tubulin or of cleaved alpha- and beta-tubulins were stabilized in the presence of added MAP2, myelin basic protein and histone H1. Cleavage of tubulin carboxy termini greatly potentiated microtubule stabilization by tau proteins. We show that this potentiation of polymer stabilization can be ascribed to tau-induced microtubule bundling. In our working conditions, such bundling upon association with tau proteins occurred only in the case of microtubules composed of cleaved alpha- and beta-tubulins and triggered apparent microtubule cross-stabilization among the bundled polymers. These results, as well as immunofluorescence analysis, which directly showed interactions between subtilisin-treated microtubules and MAPs, suggest that the carboxy termini of alpha- and beta-tubulins are not primarily involved in the binding of MAPs onto microtubules. However, interactions between tubulin carboxy termini and MAPs remain possible and might be involved in the regulation of MAP-induced microtubule bundling.

7559758|a|Cytokinesis in the green alga Spirogyra (Zygnemataceae) is characterized by centripetal growth of a septum, which impinges on a persistent, centrifugally expanding telophase spindle, leading to a phragmoplast-like structure of potential phylogenetic significance (Fowke, L. C., and J. D. Pickett-Heaps. 1969. J. Phycol. 5:273-281). Combining fluorescent tagging of the cytoskeleton in situ and video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy of live cells, the process of cytokinesis was investigated with emphasis on cytoskeletal reorganization and concomitant redistribution of organelles. Based on a sequence of cytoskeletal arrangements and the effects of cytoskeletal inhibitors thereon, cytokinetic progression could be divided into three functional stages with respect to the contribution of microfilaments (MFs) and microtubules (MTs): (1) Initiation: in early prophase, a cross wall initial was formed independently of MFs and MTs at the presumptive site of wall growth. (2) Septum ingrowth: numerous organelles accumulated at the cross wall initial concomitant with reorganization of the extensive peripheral interphase MF array into a distinct circumferential MF array. This array guided the ingrowing septum until it contacted the expanding interzonal MT array. (3) Cross wall closure: MFs at the growing edge of the septum coaligned with and extended along the interzonal MTs toward the daughter nuclei. Thus, actin-based transportation of small organelles during this third stage occurred, in part, along a scaffold previously deployed in space by MTs. Displacement of the nuclei-associated interzonal MT array by centrifugation and depolymerization of the phragmoplast-like structure showed that the success of cytokinesis at the third stage depends on the interaction of both MF and MT cytoskeletons. Important features of the phragmoplast-like structure in Spirogyra were different from the higher plant phragmoplast: in particular, MFs were responsible for the positioning of organelles at the fusion site, contrary to the proposed role of MTs in the higher plant phragmoplast.

Here, the site of interaction on TPX2 for importin alpha is mapped. A TPX2 mutant that cannot bind importin alpha is constitutively active in the induction of microtubule-containing aster-like structures in Xenopus egg extract, demonstrating that no other importin alpha or RanGTPase target is required to mediate microtubule assembly in this system. Further, recombinant TPX2 is shown to induce the formation and bundling of microtubules in dilute solutions of pure tubulin. In this purified system, importin alpha prevents TPX2-induced microtubule formation, but not TPX2-tubulin interaction or microtubule bundling. This demonstrates that TPX2 has more than one mode of interaction with tubulin and that only one of these types of interaction is abolished by importin alpha. The data suggest that the critical early function in spindle formation regulated by importin alpha is TPX2-mediated microtubule nucleation.

12224551|a|Higher plants have developed a unique pathway to control their cytoskeleton assembly and dynamics. In most other eukaryotes, microtubules are nucleated in vivo at the nucleation and organizing centers and are involved in the establishment of polarity. Although the major cytoskeletal components are common to plant and animal cells, which suggests conserved regulation mechanisms, plants do not possess centrosome-like organelles. Nevertheless, they are able to build spindles and have developed their own specific cytoskeletal arrays: the cortical arrays, the preprophase band, and the phragmoplast, which all participate in basic developmental processes, as shown by defective mutants. New approaches provide essential clues to understanding the fundamental mechanisms of microtubule nucleation. Gamma-tubulin, which is considered to be the universal nucleator, is the essential component of microtubule-nucleating complexes identified as gamma-tubulin ring complexes (gamma-TuRC) in centriolar cells. A gamma-tubulin small complex (gamma-TuSC) forms a minimal nucleating unit recruited at specific sites of activity. These components--gamma-tubulin, Spc98p, and Spc97p--are present in higher plants. They play a crucial role in microtubule nucleation at the nuclear surface, which is known as the main functional plant microtubule-organizing center, and also probably at the cell cortex and at the phragmoplast, where secondary nucleation sites may exist. Surprisingly, plant gamma-tubulin is distributed along the microtubule length. As it is not associated with Spc98p, it may not be involved in microtubule nucleation, but may preferably control microtubule dynamics. Understanding the mechanisms of microtubule nucleation is the major challenge of the current research.

12475941|a|Spindle orientation is critical for accurate chromosomal segregation in eukaryotic cells. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, orientation of the mitotic spindle is achieved by a program of microtubule-cortex interactions coupled to spindle morphogenesis. We previously implicated Bud6p in directing microtubule capture throughout this program. Herein, we have analyzed cells coexpressing GFP:Bud6 and GFP:Tub1 fusions, providing a kinetic view of Bud6p-microtubule interactions in live cells. Surprisingly, even during the G1 phase, microtubule capture at the recent division site and the incipient bud is dictated by Bud6p. These contacts are eliminated in bud6 delta cells but are proficient in kar9 delta cells. Thus, Bud6p cues microtubule capture, as soon as a new cell polarity axis is established independent of Kar9p. Bud6p increases the duration of interactions and promotes distinct modes of cortical association within the bud and neck regions. In particular, microtubule shrinkage and growth at the cortex rarely occur away from Bud6p sites. These are the interactions selectively impaired at the bud cortex in bud6 delta cells. Finally, interactions away from Bud6p sites within the bud differ from those occurring at the mother cell cortex, pointing to the existence of an independent factor controlling cortical contacts in mother cells after bud emergence.

10822258|a|Cell fusion is a universal process that occurs during fertilization and in the formation of organs such as muscles, placenta, and bones. Very little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cell fusion during pattern formation. Here we review the dynamic anatomy of all cell fusions during embryonic and postembryonic development in an organism. Nearly all the cell fates and cell lineages are invariant in the nematode C. elegans and one third of the cells that are born fuse to form 44 syncytia in a reproducible and stereotyped way. To explain the function of cell fusion in organ formation we propose the fusomorphogenetic model as a simple cellular mechanism to efficiently redistribute membranes using a combination of cell fusion and polarized membrane recycling during morphogenesis. Thus, regulated intercellular and intracellular membrane fusion processes may drive elongation of the embryo as well as postembryonic organ formation in C. elegans. Finally, we use the fusomorphogenetic hypothesis to explain the role of cell fusion in the formation of organs like muscles, bones, and placenta in mammals and other species and to speculate on how the intracellular machinery that drive fusomorphogenesis may have evolved.

Until recently, understanding of the mechanisms of cell fusion was restricted to fusion between enveloped viruses and their target cells. The identification of new factors that take part in developmental cell fusion in C. elegans opens the way to understanding how cells fuse and what the functions of this process are.

We have isolated and characterized the gamma-tubulin gene from a liverwort, one of the extant basal land plants. Sequence similarity to the gamma-tubulin gene of higher plants suggests that the gamma-tubulin gene is highly conserved in land plants. The G9 antibody to fission yeast gamma-tubulin recognized a single band of 55 kD in immunoblots from bryophytes. Immunohistochemistry with the G9 antibody clearly documented the association of gamma-tubulin with various MTOC sites in basal land plants (e.g., discrete centrosomes with and without centrioles and the plastid surface in monoplastidic meiosis of bryophytes). Changes in the distribution of gamma-tubulin occur in a cell cycle-specific manner during monoplastidic meiosis in the liverwort Dumortiera hirsuta. gamma-Tubulin changes its localization from the plastid surface in prophase I to the spindle, from the spindle to phragmoplasts and the nuclear envelope in telophase I, and back to the plastid surfaces in prophase II. In vitro experiments show that gamma-tubulin is detectable on the surface of isolated plastids and nuclei of D. hirsuta, and microtubules can be repolymerized from the isolated plastids. gamma-Tubulin localization patterns on plastid and nuclear surfaces are not affected by the destruction of microtubules by oryzalin. We conclude that gamma-tubulin is a highly conserved protein associated with microtubule nucleation in basal land plants and that it has a cell cycle-dependent distribution essential for the orderly succession of microtubule arrays.

14702385|a|In the yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sporulation involves de novo synthesis of forespore membrane (FSM) within the cytoplasm of mother cells. The FSM ultimately becomes the plasma membrane of the developing ascospores. Several protein components of the FSM have been identified. Visualization of these proteins has demonstrated the dynamic nature of the genesis and development of the FSM. It begins to develop at the differentiated outer plaque of the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and extends outwards, encapsulating each of the haploid nuclei produced by meiosis. Several coiled-coil proteins are specifically recruited to the SPBs and play indispensable roles in FSM assembly. Temporal and spatial coordination of meiotic nuclear divisions and membrane assembly is of special importance. Comparison of the processes of FSM assembly in these yeasts shows that the basic mechanism has been conserved, even though the individual proteins involved are often different. Understanding these dynamic aspects of yeast sporulation will help to elucidate a general mechanism for the cellularization of cytoplasm containing multiple nuclei.

12787780|a|The nucleoskeleton is composed of many interacting structural proteins that provide the framework for DNA replication, transcription and a variety of other nuclear functions. For example, the type-V intermediate filament proteins, the lamins, and their associated proteins (e.g. Lap2alpha) play important roles in DNA replication and transcription. Furthermore, actin, actin-related proteins and other actin-associated proteins likewise appear to be important in nuclear functions because they are components of chromatin-remodeling complexes and are involved in mRNA synthesis, processing and transport. Newly described nuclear proteins that contain both actin- and lamin-binding domains could be involved in regulating molecular crosstalk between these two types of nucleoskeletal proteins. This range of activities might help to explain why genetic defects in some of the nucleoskeletal proteins contribute to an ever-expanding list of human diseases.

The mutant is not defective in cell wall beta-glucanase activity but shows increased sensitivity to Ca2+ and Mg2+, and increased resistance to the microtubule inhibitor benomyl. The mycelial growth of sep1-1 provides a convenient method for the examination of the polar growth pattern and for pedigree analysis as demonstrated by the segregation of mating types in the homothallic microhyphae. sep1 is closely linked to ade1 (0.94 cM) on the right arm of chromosome II. The ts mutation spl1-1 confers a bent cell shape and causes aberrant septum formation at the restrictive temperature. sep1+ and spl1+ perform closely related functions as their mutant alleles interact with each other and with another septation mutant cdc4-8. These functions may overlap with certain cytoskeletal processes and with the determination of cell polarity because the triple mutant forms huge multinucleate syncytia with promiscuous branching and rare septum formation.

14079495|a|Small cytoplasmic tubules are present in the interstitial cells and cnidoblasts of hydra. They are referred to here as "microtubules." These tubular elements have an outside diameter of 180 A and an inside diameter of 80 A. By difference, the membranous wall is estimated to be 50 A thick. The maximum length of the microtubules cannot be determined from thin sections but is known to exceed 1.5 micro. In the interstitial cells the microtubules are found in the intercellular bridges, free in the cytoplasm and in association with the centrioles. In the cnidoblast they form a framework around the developing nematocyst and in late stages are related to the cnidocil forming a tight skein in the basal part of the cell. Especially in this cell, confluence of microtubules with small spherical vesicles of the Golgi complex has been observed. It is proposed that these tubules function in the transport of water, ions, or small molecules.

9605969|a|We analyzed transformation of the interphase microtubular cytoskeleton into the prophase spindle and followed the pattern of spindle axis determination. Microtubules in endosperm of the higher plant Haemanthus (Scadoxus) were stained by the immunogold and immunogold silver-enhanced methods. Basic structural units involved in spindle morphogenesis were "microtubule converging centers." We emphasized the importance of relative independence of chromosomal and microtubular cycles, and the influence of these cycles on the progress of mitosis. Cells with moderately desynchronized cycles were functional, but extreme desynchronization led to aberrant mitosis. There were three distinct phases of spindle development. The first one comprised interphase and early to mid-prophase. During this phase, the interphase microtubule meshwork radiating from the nuclear surface into the cytoplasm rearranged and formed a dense microtubule cage around the nucleus. The second phase comprised mid to late prophase, and resulted in the formation of normal (bipolar) or transitory aberrant (apolar or multipolar) prophase spindles. The third phase comprised late prophase with prometaphase. The onset of prometaphase was accompanied by a rapid association of microtubule converging centers with kinetochores. In this stage aberrant spindles transformed invariably into bipolar ones. Lateral association of a few bipolar kinetochore fibers at early prometaphase established the core of the bipolar spindle and its alignment. We concluded that (1) spindle formation is a largely independent microtubular process modified by the chromosomal/kinetochore cycle; and (2) the initial polarity of the spindle is established by microtubule converging centers, which are a functional substitute of the centrosome/MTOC. We believe that the dynamics of microtubule converging centers is an expression of microtubule self-organization driven by motor proteins as proposed by Mitchison [1992: Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 336:99].

7593284|a|The multinucleated bone-resorbing osteoclast has a hematopoietic origin. We have demonstrated previously that osteoclasts are derived from the monocytic lineage by fusion of mononuclear macrophage precursors. Using an in vitro-osteoclast differentiation model derived from pure populations of chick macrophage cultures, osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) can be formed by fusion following an active proliferation phase. However, after reaching a peak with 70% of the culture being MNGCs, a new round of expansion of the mononuclear cells is observed. The following experiments suggest that these mononuclear cells were derived directly from the MNGCs by a budding process, selectively from the central zone of the apical surface. After microinjection of the membrane-impermeable probe, Lucifer Yellow, into single MNGCs, initially only diffuse fluorescence, limited to the whole MNGC injected, was observed. However, after 24-48 hours fluorescent mononuclear cells were observed adjacent but distinct from the injected MNGC. To confirm that these mononuclear cells were indeed derived from a parent MNGC, single MNGCs were cloned into single wells. Within a week, the MNGC was surrounded by mononuclear cells, which eventually populated the entire well. These mononuclear cells could then give rise to a second generation of MNGCs following a three-week period of culture. To determine whether this process required mitosis, MNGCs were cultured for three days in the presence of the mitotic inhibitor, Ara-C, prior to microinjection with Lucifer Yellow. Fluorescent mononuclear cells were still seen to arise from a single injected MNGC under these conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

12368473|a|Controlling cell division is fundamental. One environmental cue that exerts profound control over both the orientation and frequency of cell division in vivo is a naturally occurring, wound-induced electric field (EF). Wounds in rat corneas generate endogenous EFs in the plane of the epithelial sheet because the transcorneal potential difference (TCPD; +40 mV internally positive) collapses at the wound edge, but is maintained at normal levels at 0.5 mm back from the wound. We manipulated the endogenous EF this creates by using drugs with differing actions. The wound-induced EF controlled the orientation of cell division; most epithelial cells divided with a cleavage plane parallel to the wound edge and perpendicular to the EF vector. Increasing or decreasing the EF pharmacologically, respectively increased or decreased the extent of oriented cell division. In addition, cells closest to the wound edge, where the EF was highest, were oriented most strongly by the EF. Remarkably, an endogenous EF also enhanced the frequency of cell division. This also was regulated by enhancing or suppressing the EF pharmacologically. Because the endogenous EF also regulated the wound healing rate, it may act as one control of the interplay between cell migration and cell division during healing.

12421698|a|Distinct forms of cytokinesis characterise specific phases of development in plants. In Arabidopsis, as in many other species, the endosperm that nurtures the embryo in the seed initially develops as a syncytium. This syncytial phase ends with simultaneous partitioning of the multinucleate cytoplasm into individual cells, a process referred to as cellularisation. Our in vivo observations show that, as in cytokinesis, cellularisation of the Arabidopsis endosperm is coupled to nuclear division. A genetic analysis reveals that most Arabidopsis mutations affecting cytokinesis in the embryo also impair endosperm cellularisation. These results imply that cellularisation and cytokinesis share multiple components of the same basic machinery. We further report the identification of mutations in a novel gene, SPATZLE, that specifically interfere with cellularisation of the endosperm, but not with cytokinesis in the embryo. The analysis of this mutant might identify a specific checkpoint for the onset of cellularisation.

12451594|a|Although motile endocytic vesicles form actin-rich rocket tails [Merrifield et al., 1999: Nature Cell Biol 1:72-74], the mechanism of intracellular organelle locomotion remains poorly understood. We now demonstrate that bone marrow macrophages treated with lanthanum and zinc ions, well-known secretagogue antagonists, reliably exhibit vesicle motility. This treatment results in accentuated membrane ruffling and the formation of phagosomes and early endosomes that move rapidly through the cytoplasm by assembling actin filament rocket tails. Protein-specific immunolocalization demonstrated the presence of Arp2/3 complex in the polymerization zone and throughout the actin-rich tail, whereas N-WASP was most abundant in the polymerization zone. Although Arp2/3 and N-WASP play essential roles in nucleating filament assembly, other processes (i.e., elongation and filament cross-linking) are required to produce forces needed for motility. Efficient elongation was found to require zyxin, VASP, and profilin, proteins that interact by means of their ABM-1 and ABM-2 proline-rich motifs. The functional significance of these motifs was demonstrated by inhibition of vesicle motility by the motif-specific ABM-1 and ABM-2 analogues. Furthermore, lanthanum/zinc treatment also facilitated the early onset of actin-based vaccinia motility, a process that also utilizes Arp2/3 and N-WASP for nucleation and the zyxin-VASP-profilin complex for efficient elongation. Although earlier studies using cell extracts clouded the role of oligoproline sequences in activating the polymerization zone, our studies emphasize the importance of evaluating motility in living cells.

14597736|a|Mycobacteria are responsible for a number of human and animal diseases and are classical intracellular pathogens, living inside macrophages rather than as free-living organisms during infection. Numerous intracellular pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, and Rickettsia rickettsii, exploit the host cytoskeleton by using actin-based motility for cell to cell spread during infection. Here we show that Mycobacterium marinum, a natural pathogen of fish and frogs and an occasional pathogen of humans, is capable of actively inducing actin polymerization within macrophages. M. marinum that polymerized actin were free in the cytoplasm and propelled by actin-based motility into adjacent cells. Immunofluorescence demonstrated the presence of host cytoskeletal proteins, including the Arp2/3 complex and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, throughout the actin tails. In contrast, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein localized exclusively at the actin-polymerizing pole of M. marinum. These findings show that M. marinum can escape into the cytoplasm of infected macrophages, where it can recruit host cell cytoskeletal factors to induce actin polymerization leading to direct cell to cell spread.

As in all of biology, new techniques have led to major advances in the cell and molecular biology of synapses, and the subject has evolved in ways (like the production of genetically engineered mice) that could not even be imagined 15 years ago. My plan for this review is to summarize what we knew about neurotransmitter release when Neuron first appeared and what we recognized we did not know, and then to describe how our views have changed in the intervening decade and a half. Some things we knew about synapses--"knew" in the sense that the field had reached a consensus--are no longer accepted, but for the most part, impressive advances have led to a new consensus on many issues. What I find fascinating is that in certain ways nothing has changed--many of the old arguments persist or recur in a different guise--but in other ways the field would be unrecognizable to a neurobiologist time-transported from 1988 to 2003.

It is the site of spindle attachment to the chromosomes and is crucial for the transfer of genetic information between cell and organismal generations. Although the centromere was first recognized more than 120 years ago, little is known about what determines its site(s) of activity, and how it contributes to kinetochore formation and spindle attachment. Recent work in this field has supported the hypothesis that most eukaryotic centromeres are determined epigenetically rather than by primary DNA sequence. Here, we review recent studies that have elucidated the organization and functions of centromeric chromatin, and evaluate present-day models for how centromere identity and propagation are determined.

8308076|a|The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, induces syncytium formation in cultures of many T cell lines. These syncytia have previously been viewed as disorganized fusion products in the throes of death. Evidence is presented that in HIV1-infected SupT1 cultures, syncytia five times to over one hundred times larger than single cells organize their many nuclei into blastula-like balls, reorganize their cytoskeleton to mimic that of a single cell, and extend single, giant pseudopods in a polar fashion. Medium-sized syncytia are capable of translocation through extension of these giant pseudopods. The rate of translocation of syncytia is comparable to that of single cells. Single cell motility, syncytium motility and pseudopod extension also appear to play roles in the recruitment of cells into syncytia. Finally, condensation of F-actin at cell-syncytium and syncytium-syncytium adhesion sites suggests the involvement of the cytoskeleton in the adhesion and/or subsequent fusion event. These results suggest that the fusion events involved in HIV-induced syncytia formation involve both cell motility and reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and demonstrate that syncytia are highly organized, motile entities.

1495985|a|Reduction-diffusion theories can account for both morphogenesis and the sensitivity of biological systems to weak fields. They predict that gravity can cause the symmetry breaking that is necessary for pattern formation. Microtubules play an important role in organizing the cell, and recent studies hae shown that they can form in vitro dissipative structures. We have found that these structures show patterns of microtubular orientation that are gravity dependent and that the gravitational field causes symmetry breaking. This behavior, which cannot be explained by convection, is in accordance with the theory of dissipative structures. These results suggest that microtubular dissipative structures may play an important role both in morphogenesis and in accounting for the sensitivity of biological systems to weak fields. They aso provide another explanation for biological gravitropism.

11799984|a|The molecular processes by which gravity is transduced into biological systems are poorly, if at all, understood. Under equilibrium conditions, chemical and biochemical structures do not depend upon gravity. It has been proposed that biological systems might show a gravity dependence by way of the bifurcation properties of certain types of non-linear chemical reactions that are far-from-equilibrium. We have found that in-vitro preparations of microtubules, an important element of the cellular cytoskeleton, show this type of behaviour. On earth, the solutions show macroscopic self-ordering, and the morphology of the structures that form depend upon the orientation of the sample with respect to gravity at a critical moment at an early stage in the development of the self-organised state. An experiment carried out in a sounding rocket, showed that as predicted by theories of this type, no self-organisation occurs when the microtubules are assembled under low gravity conditions. This is an experimental demonstration of how a very simple biochemical system, containing only two molecules, can be gravity sensitive. At a molecular level this behaviour results from an interaction of gravity with macroscopic concentration and density fluctuations that arise from the processes of microtubule contraction and elongation.

11152757|a|Small GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) exist in eukaryotes from yeast to human and constitute a superfamily consisting of more than 100 members. This superfamily is structurally classified into at least five families: the Ras, Rho, Rab, Sar1/Arf, and Ran families. They regulate a wide variety of cell functions as biological timers (biotimers) that initiate and terminate specific cell functions and determine the periods of time for the continuation of the specific cell functions. They furthermore play key roles in not only temporal but also spatial determination of specific cell functions. The Ras family regulates gene expression, the Rho family regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and gene expression, the Rab and Sar1/Arf families regulate vesicle trafficking, and the Ran family regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport and microtubule organization. Many upstream regulators and downstream effectors of small G proteins have been isolated, and their modes of activation and action have gradually been elucidated. Cascades and cross-talks of small G proteins have also been clarified. In this review, functions of small G proteins and their modes of activation and action are described.

3880758|a|Microtubule organization and nucleation were studied during in vitro human myogenesis by immunocytology that used monoclonal and polyclonal antitubulin antibodies and a rabbit nonimmune serum that reacts with human centrosomes. In myoblasts, we observed a classical microtubule network centered on juxtanuclear centrosomes. Myotubes possessed numerous microtubules organized in parallel without any apparent nucleation centers. Centrosomes in these cells were not associated one to each nucleus but were often clustered in the vicinity of nuclei groups. They were significantly smaller than those of the mononucleated cells. The periphery of each nucleus in myotubes was labeled with the serum that labels centrosomes suggesting a profound reorganization of microtubule-nucleating material. Regrowth experiments after Nocodazole treatment established that microtubules were growing from the periphery of the nuclei. The redistribution of nucleating material was shown to take place early after myoblast fusion. Such a phenomenon appears to be specific to myogenic differentiation in that artificially induced polykaryons behaved differently: the centrosomes aggregated to form only one or a few giant nucleating centers and the nuclei did not participate directly in the nucleation of microtubules. The significance of these results is discussed in relation to the possible role of the centrosome in establishing cell polarity.

3894380|a|In vitro myogenesis involves a dramatic reorganization of the microtubular network, characterized principally by the relocalization of microtubule nucleating sites at the surface of the nuclei in myotubes, in marked contrast with the classical pericentriolar localization observed in myoblasts (Tassin, A. M., B. Maro, and M. Bornens, 1985, J. Cell Biol., 100:35-46). Since a spatial relationship between the Golgi apparatus and the centrosome is observed in most animal cells, we have decided to follow the fate of the Golgi apparatus during myogenesis by an immunocytochemical approach, using wheat germ agglutinin and an affinity-purified anti-galactosyltransferase. We show that Golgi apparatus in myotubes displays a perinuclear distribution which is strikingly different from the polarized juxtanuclear organization observed in myoblasts. As a result, the Golgi apparatus in myotubes is situated close to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC), the cis-side being situated at a fixed distance from the nuclear envelope, a situation which suggests the existence of a structural association between the Golgi apparatus and the nuclear periphery. This is supported by experiments of microtubule depolymerization by nocodazole, in which a minimal effect was observed on Golgi apparatus localization in myotubes in contrast with the dramatic scattering observed in myoblasts. In both cell types, electron microscopy reveals that microtubule disruption generates individual dictyosomes; this suggests that the connecting structures between dictyosomes are principally affected. This structural dependency of the Golgi apparatus upon microtubules is not apparently accompanied by a reverse dependency of MTOC structure or function upon Golgi apparatus activity. Golgi apparatus modification by monensin, as effective in myotubes as in myoblasts, is without apparent effect on MTOC localization or activity and on microtubule stability. The main result of our study is to show that in a cell type where the MTOC is dissociated from centrioles and where antero-posterior polarity has disappeared, the association between the Golgi apparatus and the MTOC is maintained. The significance of such a tight association is discussed.

Within minutes of egg activation, dynamic actin-rich comet tails appeared on a subset of cytoplasmic vesicles that were enriched in protein kinase C (PKC), causing the vesicles to move through the cytoplasm. Actin comet tail formation in vivo was stimulated by the PKC activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and this process could be reconstituted in a cell-free system. We used this system to define the characteristics that distinguish vesicles associated with actin comet tails from other vesicles in the extract. We found that the protein, N-WASP, was recruited to the surface of every vesicle associated with an actin comet tail, suggesting that vesicle movement results from actin assembly nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex, the immediate downstream target of N-WASP. The motile vesicles accumulated the dye acridine orange, a marker for endosomes and lysosomes. Furthermore, vesicles associated with actin comet tails had the morphological features of multivesicular endosomes as revealed by electron microscopy. Endosomes and lysosomes from mammalian cells preferentially nucleated actin assembly and moved in the Xenopus egg extract system. These results define endosomes and lysosomes as recruitment sites for the actin nucleation machinery and demonstrate that actin assembly contributes to organelle movement. Conversely, by nucleating actin assembly, intracellular membranes may contribute to the dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton.

11909553|a|A key feature of myogenesis is the fusion of myoblasts to form multinucleate myotubes. Recent work in Drosophila has uncovered a collection of genes that operate at different stages of this process. Some interactions between them have been described that begin to define links from outside the cell via the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Future studies will establish the extent to which the molecular mechanisms of myoblast fusion are conserved between Drosophila and other animals, as found in other aspects of myogenesis.

12589071|a|In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an actomyosin-based contractile ring is present during cytokinesis, as occurs in animal cells. However, the precise requirement for this structure during budding yeast cytokinesis has been controversial. Here we show that deletion of MYO1, the single myosin II gene, is lethal in a commonly used strain background. The terminal phenotype of myo1Delta is interconnected chains of cells, suggestive of a cytokinesis defect. To further investigate the role of Myo1p in cytokinesis, we conditionally disrupted Myo1 function by using either a dominant negative Myo1p construct or a strain where expression of Myo1p can be shut-off. Both ways of disruption of Myo1 function result in a failure in cytokinesis. Additionally, we show that a myo1Delta strain previously reported to grow nearly as well as the wild type contains a single genetic suppressor that alleviates the severe cytokinesis defects of myo1Delta. Using fluorescence time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy techniques, we show that cytokinesis in this strain is achieved through formation of multiple aberrant septa. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the actomyosin ring is crucial for successful cytokinesis in budding yeast, but new cytokinetic mechanisms can evolve through genetic changes when myosin II function is impaired.

11309419|a|The correct positioning of the nucleus is often important in defining the spatial organization of the cell, for example, in determining the cell division plane. In interphase Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells, the nucleus is positioned in the middle of the cylindrical cell in an active microtubule (MT)-dependent process. Here, we used green fluorescent protein markers to examine the dynamics of MTs, spindle pole body, and the nuclear envelope in living cells. We find that interphase MTs are organized in three to four antiparallel MT bundles arranged along the long axis of the cell, with MT plus ends facing both the cell tips and minus ends near the middle of the cell. The MT bundles are organized from medial MT-organizing centers that may function as nuclear attachment sites. When MTs grow to the cell tips, they exert transient forces produced by plus end MT polymerization that push the nucleus. After an average of 1.5 min of growth at the cell tip, MT plus ends exhibit catastrophe and shrink back to the nuclear region before growing back to the cell tip. Computer modeling suggests that a balance of these pushing MT forces can provide a mechanism to position the nucleus at the middle of the cell.

12019561|a|On the basis of "cell theory," we tend to think that some changes in cellular behavior must be responsible for mutant morphology. According to the cell theory, the unit of morphogenesis of a multicellular organism is the cell. Another interpretation of morphogenesis of plants is the "organismal theory," which postulates that the individual cell is not the basic unit of morphogenesis. Here we examine the validity of the cell and organismal theories, with particular emphasis on the phenotypes of mutant or transgenic Arabidopsis plants with altered leaf morphology. Genetic evidence shows that a compensatory system(s) is involved in leaf morphogenesis, and an increase in cell volume might be triggered by a decrease in cell number. Such evidence provides a new link between cell and organismal theories. In conclusion, the size and number of leaf cells affect the dimensions and sizes of leaves. Moreover, the leaf size is, at least to some extent, uncoupled from the size and number of cells by the compensatory system(s).

14588246|a|In centrosome-containing cells, microtubules utilized in spindle formation are thought to be nucleated at the centrosome. However, spindle formation can proceed following experimental destruction of centrosomes or in cells lacking centrosomes, suggesting that non-centrosome-associated microtubules may contribute to spindle formation, at least when centrosomes are absent. Direct observation of prometaphase cells expressing GFP-alpha-tubulin shows that peripheral, non-centrosome-associated microtubules are utilized in spindle formation, even in the presence of centrosomes. Clusters of peripheral microtubules moved into the centrosomal region, demonstrating that a centrosomal microtubule array can be composed of both centrosomally nucleated and peripheral microtubules. Peripheral bundles also moved laterally into the forming spindle between the spindle poles; 3D reconstructions of fixed cells reveal interactions between peripheral and centrosome-associated microtubules. The spindle pole component NuMA and gamma-tubulin were present at the foci of peripheral microtubule clusters, indicating that microtubules moved into the spindle with minus ends leading. Photobleach- and photoactivation-marking experiments of cells expressing GFP-tubulin or a photoactivatable variant of GFP-tubulin, respectively, demonstrate that microtubule motion into the forming spindle results from transport and sliding interactions, not treadmilling. Our results directly demonstrate that non-centrosome-associated microtubules contribute to spindle formation in centrosome-containing cells.

15037305|a|Animal cell division is believed to be mediated primarily by the 'purse-string' mechanism, which entails furrowing of the equatorial region, driven by the interaction of actin and myosin II filaments within contractile rings. However, myosin II-null Dictyostelium cells on substrates divide efficiently in a cell cycle-coupled manner. This process, termed cytokinesis B, appears to be driven by polar traction forces. Data in the literature can be interpreted as suggesting that adherent higher animal cells also use a cytokinesis B-like mechanism for cytokinesis. An additional chemotaxis-based cytokinesis that involves a 'midwife' cell has also been reported. Collectively, these findings demonstrate an unexpected diversity of mechanisms by which animal cells carry out cytokinesis.

Recent genomic and functional studies suggest that five cargo-carrying motors emerged in primitive eukaryotes and have been widely used throughout evolution. The complexity of these "Toolbox" motors expanded in higher eukaryotes through gene duplication, alternative splicing, and the addition of associated subunits, which enabled new cargoes to be transported. Remarkably, fungi, parasites, plants, and animals have distinct subsets of Toolbox motors in their genomes, suggesting an underlying diversity of strategies for intracellular transport.

The changes depend on field orientation, strength, and timing. We present a model that qualitatively accounts for these effects and which presumes that the structures involved in cell division are cylindrically symmetric and diamagnetically anisotropic and that the geometry of the centrosome replication and spreading processes dictates the nominal cleavage geometry. Within this model, the altered cleavage geometry results from the magnetic field-induced realignment of mitotic structures, which causes a realignment of the centrosome replication and spreading processes.

The bacterial ancestry is made even more obvious by the findings that the bacterial cell-shape-determining proteins Mreb and Mbl form large spirals inside non-spherical cells, and that MreB polymerises in vitro into protofilaments very similar to actin. Recent advances in research on two proteins involved in prokaryotic cytokinesis and cell shape determination that have similar properties to the key components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton are discussed.

11544518|a|It was thought until recently that bacteria lack the actin or tubulin filament networks that organize eukaryotic cytoplasm. However, we show here that the bacterial MreB protein assembles into filaments with a subunit repeat similar to that of F-actin-the physiological polymer of eukaryotic actin. By elucidating the MreB crystal structure we demonstrate that MreB and actin are very similar in three dimensions. Moreover, the crystals contain protofilaments, allowing visualization of actin-like strands at atomic resolution. The structure of the MreB protofilament is in remarkably good agreement with the model for F-actin, showing that the proteins assemble in identical orientations. The actin-like properties of MreB explain the finding that MreB forms large fibrous spirals under the cell membrane of rod-shaped cells, where they are involved in cell-shape determination. Thus, prokaryotes are now known to possess homologues both of tubulin, namely FtsZ, and of actin.

12393012|a|Growing evidence shows that the actin cytoskeleton is a key effector of signal transduction, which controls and maintains the shape of plant cells, as well as playing roles in plant morphogenesis. Recently, several signaling pathways, including those triggered by hormones, Ca(2+), and cAMP, have been reported to be connected to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The molecular mechanisms involved in such signaling cascades are, however, largely unknown. The Arabidopsis genome sequence is a valuable tool for identifying some of the highly conserved molecules that are involved in such signaling cascades. Recent work has begun to unravel these complex pathways using a panoply of techniques, including genetic analysis, live-cell imaging of intracellular actin dynamics, in vivo localization of factors that are involved in the control of actin dynamics, and the biochemical characterization of how these factors function.

3332655|a|Actin cortex and microtubules determine two different types of morphological organization of the cytoplasm. Cooperation and competition between these two organizations may produce a diversity of final forms. Actin cortex alone, without the other cytoskeletal systems, is sufficient for the organization of vectorized pseudopod-forming cytoplasmatic units termed 'actinoplasts'. Reversible segregation of cytoplasm into actinoplasts and microtubule-rich stable domains ('tubuloplasts') is suggested to play an important role in many types of morphogenesis. Segregation of this type can be induced in fibroblasts of certain lines by the tumour promotor, tetradecanoyl phorbol-acetate (TPA). Self-organization of each actinoplast leads to the development of microfilament bundles associated with focal contacts. Analysis of the evolution of these bundle-contact structures during spreading of mouse fibroblasts suggests that their patterns are determined by the degree of centripetal tension within the actin cortex; the microtubular system stabilizes these patterns. Pseudopodial activity of the edges of the actinoplasts can be controlled by environmental factors. One particular type of control, i.e. the effect of cell-cell contact, is discussed. Actin cortex and microtubules seem to have alternative effects on the distribution of vimentin-containing intermediate filaments.

9889119|a|Directional cell motility implies the presence of a steering mechanism and a functional asymmetry between the front and rear of the cell. How this functional asymmetry arises and is maintained during cell locomotion is, however, unclear. Lamellar fragments of fish epidermal keratocytes, which lack nuclei, microtubules and most organelles, present a simplified, perhaps minimal, system for analyzing this problem because they consist of little other than the motile machinery enclosed by a membrane and yet can move with remarkable speed and persistence.We have produced two types of cellular fragments: discoid stationary fragments and polarized fragments undergoing locomotion. The organization and dynamics of the actin-myosin II system were isotropic in stationary fragments and anisotropic in the moving fragments. To investigate whether the creation of asymmetry could result in locomotion, a transient mechanical stimulus was applied to stationary fragments. The stimulus induced localized contraction and the formation of an actin-myosin II bundle at one edge of the fragment. Remarkably, stimulated fragments started to undergo locomotion and the locomotion and associated anisotropic organization of the actin-myosin II system were sustained after withdrawal of the stimulus.We propose a model in which lamellar cytoplasm is considered a dynamically bistable system capable of existing in a non-polarized or polarized state and interconvertible by mechanical stimulus. The model explains how the anisotropic organization of the lamellum is maintained in the process of locomotion. Polarized locomotion is sustained through a positive-feedback loop intrinsic to the actin-myosin II machinery: anisotropic organization of the machinery drives translocation, which then reinforces the asymmetry of the machinery, favoring further translocation.

These proteins function as molecular switches that cycle between "active" and "inactive" states, and this cycle is linked to the binding and hydrolysis of GTP. The Arabidopsis genome contains 93 genes that encode small GTP-binding protein homologs. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes shows that plants contain Rab, Rho, Arf, and Ran GTPases, but no Ras GTPases. We have assembled complete lists of these small GTPases families, as well as accessory proteins that control their activity, and review what is known of the functions of individual members of these families in Arabidopsis. We also discuss the possible roles of these GTPases in relation to their similarity to orthologs with known functions and localizations in yeast and/or animal systems.

11514633|a|Actin microfilaments, which are prominent in pollen tubes, have been implicated in the growth process; however, their mechanism of action is not well understood. In the present work we have used profilin and DNAse I injections, as well as latrunculin B and cytochalasin D treatments, under quantitatively controlled conditions, to perturb actin microfilament structure and assembly in an attempt to answer this question. We found that a approximately 50% increase in the total profilin pool was necessary to half-maximally inhibit pollen tube growth, whereas a approximately 100% increase was necessary for half-maximal inhibition of cytoplasmic streaming. DNAse I showed a similar inhibitory activity but with a threefold more pronounced effect on growth than streaming. Latrunculin B, at only 1--4 nM in the growth medium, has a similar proportion of inhibition of growth over streaming to that of profilin. The fact that tip growth is more sensitive than streaming to the inhibitory substances and that there is no correlation between streaming and growth rates suggests that tip growth requires actin assembly in a process independent of cytoplasmic streaming.

11169856|a|The glycoprotein secretory pathway of yeast serves mainly for cell surface growth and cell division. It involves a centrifugal transport of transit macromolecules among organelles, whose membranes contain resident proteins needed for driving the transport. These resident membrane proteins return by retrograde vesicular transport. Apart from this, the pathway involves endocytosis. The model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and vertebrate cells were found to contain very similar gene products regulating the molecular mechanism of glycoprotein transport, and the cellular mechanism of their secretion pathways was therefore also presumed to be identical. Biochemists have postulated that, in S. cerevisiae, the translocation of peptides through the endoplasmic reticulum membranes into the lumen of ER cisternae and the core glycosylation is followed by a vector-mediated transport into the functional cascade of the Golgi system cisternae and between them. This is the site of maturation and sorting of glycoproteins, before the ultimate transport by other vectors involving either secretion from the cells (exocytosis across the plasmalemma into the cell wall) or transport into the lysosome-like vacuole via a prevacuolar compartment, which serves at the same time as a primary endosome. The established cellular model of secretion deals with budding yeast; interphase yeast cells, in which the secretion is limited and which predominate in exponential cultures, have not been taken into consideration. The quality of organelle imaging in S. cerevisiae ultra-thin sections depends on the fixation technique used and on specimen contrasting by metals. The results achieved by combinations of different techniques differ mostly in the imaging of bilayers of membrane interfaces and the transparence of the matrix phase. Fixation procedures are decisive for the results of topochemical localisations of cellular antigenic components or enzyme activities, which form the basis of the following survey of functional morphology of organelles involved in the yeast secretory pathway. The existing results of these studies do not confirm all aspects of the vertebrate model of the Golgi apparatus proposed by molecular geneticists to hold for S. cerevisiae, and alternative models of the cellular mechanism of secretion in this yeast are, therefore, also discussed.

11081513|a|In Caenorhabditis elegans, polarity along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis is established shortly after fertilization and is determined by the sperm, whose position specifies the posterior end of the embryo'. Although many factors required for the establishment of A/P polarity have been described, the nature of the spatial cue provided by the sperm remains unknown. Here we show that a microtubule-organizing centre is necessary and sufficient to establish several aspects of A/P polarity. In wildtype embryos, appearance of the first molecular asymmetries along the A/P axis correlates with and requires nucleation of microtubules by the sperm-derived centrosomes (sperm asters). In mutant embryos arrested in meiosis, sperm asters fail to form, and posterior is defined by the position of the persistent meiotic spindle rather than by the position of the sperm. Together, our data indicate that the primary spatial cue for A/P polarity in C. elegans derives from microtubules emanating from the sperm asters. Our findings support a parallel between C. elegans zygotes and other cells, such as Drosophila oocytes, which rely on microtubules to regulate polarity.

14659004|a|The retroviral Gag protein is the central player in the process of virion assembly at the plasma membrane, and is sufficient to induce the formation and release of virus-like particles. Recent evidence suggests that Gag may co-opt the host cell's endocytic machinery to facilitate retroviral assembly and release.A search for novel partners interacting with the Gag protein of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) via the yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interaction assay resulted in the identification of endophilin 2, a component of the machinery involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that endophilin interacts with the matrix or MA domain of the Gag protein of Mo-MuLV, but not of human immunodeficiency virus, HIV. Both exogenously expressed and endogenous endophilin are incorporated into Mo-MuLV viral particles. Titration experiments suggest that the binding sites for inclusion of endophilin into viral particles are limited and saturable. Knock-down of endophilin with small interfering RNA (siRNA) had no effect on virion production, but overexpression of endophilin and, to a lesser extent, of several fragments of the protein, result in inhibition of Mo-MuLV virion production, but not of HIV virion production.This study shows that endophilins interact with Mo-MuLV Gag and affect virion production. The findings imply that endophilin is another component of the large complex that is hijacked by retroviruses to promote virion production.

11896182|a|Plant microtubule arrays differ fundamentally from their animal, fungal and protistan counterparts. These differences largely reflect the requirements of plant composite polymer cell walls and probably also relate to the acquisition of chloroplasts. Plant microtubules are usually dispersed and lack conspicuous organizing centres. The key to understanding this dispersed nature is the identification of proteins that interact with and regulate the spatial and dynamic properties of microtubules. Over the past decade, a number of these proteins have been uncovered, including numerous kinesin-related proteins and a 65 kDa class of structural microtubule-associated proteins that appear to be unique to plants. Mutational analysis has identified MOR1, a probable stabilizer of microtubules that is a homologue of the TOGp-XMAP215 class of high-molecular-weight microtubule-associated proteins, and a katanin p60 subunit homologue implicated in the severing of microtubules. The identification of these two proteins provides new insights into the mechanisms controlling microtubule assembly and dynamics, particularly in the dispersed cortical array found in highly polarized plant cells.

The formation of heterokaryons increases in a linear manner over 1.5 years and seems to be stable. The dominant Purkinje neurons caused the BMDC nuclei within the resulting heterokaryons to enlarge, exhibit dispersed chromatin and activate a Purkinje neuron-specific transgene, L7-GFP.

11231570|a|The guanosine tri-phosphatase Ran stimulates assembly of microtubule spindles. However, it is not known what aspects of the microtubule cytoskeleton are subject to regulation by Ran in mitosis. Here we show that Ran-GTP stimulates microtubule assembly by increasing the rescue frequency of microtubules three- to eightfold. In addition to changing microtubule dynamics, Ran-GTP also alters the balance of motor activities, partly as a result of an increase in the amount of motile Eg5, a plus-end-directed microtubule motor that is essential for spindle formation. Thus, Ran regulates multiple processes that are involved in spindle assembly.

10871281|a|TPX2, the targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2 (Xklp2), was identified as a microtubule-associated protein that mediates the binding of the COOH-terminal domain of Xklp2 to microtubules (Wittmann, T., H. Boleti, C. Antony, E. Karsenti, and I. Vernos. 1998. J. Cell Biol. 143:673-685). Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of Xenopus TPX2. TPX2 is a novel, basic 82.4-kD protein that is phosphorylated during mitosis in a microtubule-dependent way. TPX2 is nuclear during interphase and becomes localized to spindle poles in mitosis. Spindle pole localization of TPX2 requires the activity of the dynein-dynactin complex. In late anaphase TPX2 becomes relocalized from the spindle poles to the midbody. TPX2 is highly homologous to a human protein of unknown function and thus defines a new family of vertebrate spindle pole components. We investigated the function of TPX2 using spindle assembly in Xenopus egg extracts. Immunodepletion of TPX2 from mitotic egg extracts resulted in bipolar structures with disintegrating poles and a decreased microtubule density. Addition of an excess of TPX2 to spindle assembly reactions gave rise to monopolar structures with abnormally enlarged poles. We conclude that, in addition to its function in targeting Xklp2 to microtubule minus ends during mitosis, TPX2 also participates in the organization of spindle poles.

11835058|a|Polarity is a common feature of many different cell types, including the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, the Drosophila oocyte and mammalian epithelial cells. The initial establishment of cell polarity depends on asymmetric cues that lead to reorganization of the cytoskeleton and polarized localization of several cortical proteins that act downstream of the polarization cues. The past year revealed that homologs of the C. elegans par (partitioning defective) genes are also essential for establishing polarity in Drosophila and vertebrate cells. There is growing evidence that the proteins encoded by these genes interact with key regulators of both the actin and the microtubule cytoskeletons.

12077305|a|A theory for the evolution of cellular organization is presented. The model is based on the (data supported) conjecture that the dynamic of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is primarily determined by the organization of the recipient cell. Aboriginal cell designs are taken to be simple and loosely organized enough that all cellular componentry can be altered and/or displaced through HGT, making HGT the principal driving force in early cellular evolution. Primitive cells did not carry a stable organismal genealogical trace. Primitive cellular evolution is basically communal. The high level of novelty required to evolve cell designs is a product of communal invention, of the universal HGT field, not intralineage variation. It is the community as a whole, the ecosystem, which evolves. The individual cell designs that evolved in this way are nevertheless fundamentally distinct, because the initial conditions in each case are somewhat different. As a cell design becomes more complex and interconnected a critical point is reached where a more integrated cellular organization emerges, and vertically generated novelty can and does assume greater importance. This critical point is called the "Darwinian Threshold" for the reasons given.

11732614|a|Cell walls are at the basis of a structural, four-dimensional framework of plant form and growth time. Recent rapid progress of cell wall research has led to the situation where the old, long-lasting juxtaposition: "living" protoplast--"dead" cell wall, had to be dropped. Various attempts of re-interpretation cast, however, some doubts over the very nature of plant cell and the status of the walls within such a cell. Following a comparison of exocellular matrices of plants and animals, their position in relation to cells and organisms is analysed. A multitude of perspectives of the biological organisation of living beings is presented with particular attention paid to the cellular and organismal theories. Basic tenets and resulting corollaries of both theories are compared, and evolutionary and developmental implications are considered. Based on these data, "The Plant Body"--an organismal concept of plants and plant cells is described.

8577831|a|The problem of the nature of life has a long history going back to the Greeks. There was little real progress until the 19th century and Aristotle may have been at home with many 18th century ideas about vital forces and basic units. Although Hooke described cells in 1665 it took a further 200 years for the significance and nature of cells to be appreciated. In the mid 18th century some considered the basic building blocks of living matter to be fibrous. Globular theories, the precursor to the cell theory, were quite popular at the beginning of the 19th century. Many workers, as microscopes improved, had described various cell types and structures including the nucleus but the idea that cells were the universal units is associated with in 1838 and that of Schwann in 1839. However, Schwann mistakenly thought that cells could form de novo. Cell division was established by Remak and others in the 1850s. Mitosis was first understood by Flemming in 1882. The existence of the animal cell membrane was only established by the beautiful experiments of Overton in 1895. The history of the cell theory can be used to show that progress can be based on incorrect but productive ideas. It is one of the most important ideas in all of biology.

12679039|a|All eukaryotic cells have regulatory mechanisms that limit genomic replication to a single round each cell cycle. These systems function by blocking formation of prereplication complexes. The regulatory mechanisms in the yeast S. cerevisiae have been identified, but these do not appear to be conserved in metazoans. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we have identified a metazoan-specific regulatory system that limits replication to a single round. We show that during S phase, soluble MCM helicase, an essential initiation factor, is inactivated when it associates with exportin-1/Crm1. Formation of this complex is dependent on both high Ran-GTP and cdk2 kinase activity. Lowering Ran-GTP within nuclei or nuclear extracts allows MCM to reassociate with chromatin during S phase and induces re-replication. Importantly, prevention of re-replication requires MCM-Crm1 complex formation, but it does not require export of MCM from the nucleus. Therefore, in metazoans, Crm1 functions in both nuclear export and blocking of re-replication.

11031242|a|Cell walls separate individual plant cells. To enable essential intercellular communication, plants have evolved membrane-lined channels, termed plasmodesmata, that interconnect the cytoplasm between neighboring cells. Historically, plasmodesmata were viewed as facilitating traffic of low-molecular weight growth regulators and nutrients critical to growth. Evidence for macromolecular transport via plasmodesmata was solely based on the exploitation of plasmodesmata by plant viruses during infectious spread. Now plasmodesmata are revealed to transport endogenous proteins, including transcription factors important for development. Two general types of proteins, non-targeted and plasmodesmata-targeted, traffic plasmodesmata channels. Size and subcellular location influence non-targeted protein transportability. Superimposed on cargo-specific parameters, plasmodesmata themselves fluctuate in aperture between closed, open, and dilated. Furthermore, plasmodesmata alter their transport capacity temporally during development and spatially in different regions of the plant. Plasmodesmata are exposed as major gatekeepers of signaling molecules that facilitate or regulate developmental programs, maintain physiological status, and respond to pathogens.

12211106|a|Despite abundant evidence of actin's involvement at the particle internalization stage of phagocytosis, little is known about whether phagosomes undergo the same type of actin-based motility as observed with endocytic vesicles or such intracellular pathogens as Listeria and Shigella. By employing video microscopy to follow the fate of latex bead-containing phagosomes within the cytoplasm of bone marrow macrophages, we have made the novel observation of actin-based phagosome motility. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that phagosomes containing IgG-opsonized, bovine serum albumin (or BSA) -coated or uncoated latex beads all formed actin-rich rocket tails that persisted only during a brief, 1-2 min period of actin-based motility. Average speeds of actin-based phagosome motility were 0.13 +/- 0.06 microm/s for IgG-coated beads, 0.14 +/- 0.04 microm/s for BSA-coated beads, and 0.11+/- 0.03 microm/s for uncoated beads. Moreover, the speeds and motile-phase duration of each type of phagosome were comparable to the behavior of pinosomes [Merrifield et al., 1999: Nat. Cell Biol. 1:72-74.]. Determination of optimal conditions for observing and analyzing actin-based phagosome motility should facilitate future investigations of phagocytosis and phagosome maturation.

There are many instances in which cell divisions in vivo occur in the presence of direct-current physiological EF, for example, during embryonic morphogenesis, neuronal and epithelial differentiation, wound healing, or tumor formation. Endogenous physiological EFs may play important roles in some or all of these processes by regulating the axis of cell division and, hence, the positioning of daughter cells.

12188043|a|It is recalled that dispensability of sequences and neutral substitution rate must not be construed to be markers of nonfunctionality. Different aspects of functionality relate to differently-sized nucleotide communities. At the time cells became nucleated, a boom of epigenetic processes led to uses of DNA that required many more nucleotides operating collectively than do functions definable in terms of classical genetics. Each order of magnitude of nucleotide plurality was colonized by functions germane to that order. The eukaryote genome became a great epigenetic machine. Sequences of different levels of nucleotide plurality are briefly discussed from the point of view of their functional relevance. By their activities as both transcribed genes and cis-acting repeats, SINEs and LINEs are the principal link between genetic and epigenetic processes. SINEs can act as local repeats to produce position effect variegation (PEV) in a nearby gene. PEV may thus represent a general method of overall transcriptional regulation at the level of cell collectivities. When tracking the scale dependence of nucleotide function, one finds the 100 kb order of nucleotide plurality to provide epigenetically the basis at once for PEV, imprinting, and cell determination, with sectorial repressibility a trait common to the three. In sectorial repressibility, introns may play a structural role favoring the stability of higher-order chromatin structures. At that level of nucleotide involvement, nonconserved nonhomologous nonprotein-coding sequences may often play the same structural roles. In addition, genomic distance per se--and, therefore, the mass of intervening nucleotides--can have functional effects. Distances between enhancers and promoters need to be probed in this respect. At the 1,000 kb level of nucleotide function, attention is focused on the formation of centromeres. It is one of the levels of nucleotide plurality per function where specificity in the generation of DNA/protein complexes seems to depend more upon the structural fit among factors than upon the DNA sequence. This circumstance may explain in part the prevailing difficulty in recognizing the functional nature of sequences among non-protein-coding nucleotide arrays and the propensity among investigators to tag the majority of DNA sequences in higher organisms as functionally meaningless. Noncoding DNA often may not be 'selected' as an appropriate niche for a certain function, but be 'elected' in that capacity by a group of factors, as a preexisting sequence that is only now called upon to serve. Much of the non-protein-coding DNA may thus be only conditionally functional and in fact may never be elected to functions at a high level of nucleotide plurality. Eukaryotes are composites, at different levels of this plurality, of the functional and the nonfunctional, as well as of the conditionally functional and the outright functional. Thus, a sequence that is nonfunctional at one level of nucleotide plurality may participate in a functional sequence at a more inclusive level. In the end, every nucleotide is at least infinitesimally functional if, for metabolic and developmental reasons, the chromatin mass as such becomes a selectable entity. Given the scale dependence of nucleotide function, large amounts of 'junk DNA', contrary to common belief, must be assumed to contribute to the complexity of gene interaction systems and of organisms.

10358769|a|Phagocytosis of pathogens by macrophages initiates the innate immune response, which in turn orchestrates the adaptive response. In order to discriminate between infectious agents and self, macrophages have evolved a restricted number of phagocytic receptors, like the mannose receptor, that recognize conserved motifs on pathogens. Pathogens are also phagocytosed by complement receptors after relatively nonspecific opsonization with complement and by Fc receptors after specific opsonization with antibodies. All these receptors induce rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton that lead to the internalization of the particle. However, important differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying phagocytosis by different receptors are now being appreciated. These include differences in the cytoskeletal elements that mediate ingestion, differences in vacuole maturation, and differences in inflammatory responses. Infectious agents, such as M. tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, and Salmonella typhimurium, enter macrophages via heterogeneous pathways and modify vacuolar maturation in a manner that favors their survival. Macrophages also play an important role in the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells; a notable feature of this process is the absence of an inflammatory response.

These studies evaluated the relative amounts of lipocortin I in human alveolar macrophages compared with blood monocytes, using a specific polyclonal antibody and the technique of Western analysis. Lipocortin I was detected in all isolates of human alveolar macrophages and had molecular masses of 37,000 and 33,000 D. Corticosteroids increased amounts of lipocortin I in these cells in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was specific for corticosteroids as related steroids had no effect. Blood monocytes, when compared with alveolar macrophages, contained relatively small amounts of lipocortin I. We conclude that lipocortin I is present in relatively large amounts in human alveolar macrophages and that amounts of the protein can be induced by corticosteroids. We further speculate that the relative amounts of lipocortin I within monocytes/macrophages may be a marker of differentiation.

12689596|a|Engulfment of apoptotic cells requires presentation of new cell surface ligands by the dying cells. Using a differential proteomics technology, we identify that annexin I is a caspase-dependent engulfment ligand; it is recruited from the cytosol and exported to the outer plasma membrane leaflet, colocalizes with phosphatidylserine, and is required for efficient clearance of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR) clustering around apoptotic cells indicates a requirement for annexin I. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, downregulation of the annexin homolog prevents efficient engulfment of pharyngeal cell corpses. These results provide novel mechanistic insights into how apoptotic cells are removed and may explain a pathogenic mechanism of chronic inflammatory diseases where annexin I autoantibodies have been described.

9637533|a|We have previously identified a 16-kDa protein with a pI of 5.1 (P16/5.1) that is associated with macrophage CR3. Microsequencing of P16/5.1 indicated exclusive homology to the beta-galactoside-binding lectin, galectin-1. Abs specific to a galectin-1 unique peptide reacted with P16/5.1. The association of P16/5.1 with CR3 was specifically inhibited by lactose, which binds with high affinity to galectin-1. These data together with similarities in molecular mass and pI suggest that P16/5.1 is galectin-1. Two-color immunofluorescence staining revealed the expression of galectin-1 on the macrophage surface and its colocalization with CR3. However, a surplus of CR3 was free of galectin-1, and some galectin-1 molecules were associated with cell surface receptors other than CR3. Based on these results we propose two models depicting the functional significance of CR3-galectin-1 association: 1) homodimeric galectin-1 possessing a divalent sugar binding site may act as an extracellular adapter molecule that cross-links CR3 with other receptors; and 2) association of galectin-1 with beta-galactosides on the extracellular domain of CR3 may modify the binding affinity of the receptor to its ligand. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive and can clarify the mode by which CR3 transmits signals in macrophages.

2971629|a|The mechanism by which glucocorticoid steroids suppress yeast phagocytosis in cultures of resident and thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages was examined. Time course and dose-response studies demonstrated that the phagocytic capacity of resident macrophages was suppressed by dexamethasone to the same extent in both newly established cultures and cultures that were incubated for several days. In contrast, relative to newly established cultures of elicited cells that were treated with the drug, elicited macrophages that were incubated for at least 1 day prior to exposure to dexamethasone, exhibited enhanced sensitivity to the action of the steroid. Steroid-induced phagocytic inhibitory responses were blocked by the metabolic inhibitors cycloheximide and actinomycin D. The suppression of phagocytosis by dexamethasone was mediated by a factor, present in the cellular homogenates of steroid-treated macrophages, that was partially purified by Sephadex G-25 chromatography. Since the phagocytic inhibitory activity in these homogenates was destroyed following exposure to heat and trypsin, the factor has been named phagocytosis inhibitory protein (PIP). The antiphagocytic activity of PIP was neutralized by treatment with RM23, a monoclonal antibody directed against lipocortin. The results support the hypothesis that the suppression of yeast ingestion is mediated by the action of PIP, which is induced in dexamethasone-treated macrophage cultures. Moreover, PIP appears to belong to the lipocortin family of phospholipase inhibitory proteins.

3132914|a|Dexamethasone suppresses phagocytosis of heat killed Saccharomyces cerevisiae in cultures of murine peritoneal macrophages. Recent observations suggest that dexamethasone induces a phagocytic inhibitory protein that suppresses yeast ingestion by inhibiting macrophage phospholipase A2 activity. The present investigation, therefore, examined whether macrophage lipid metabolism is modulated by dexamethasone. Control and steroid treated macrophages were allowed to incorporate radiolabeled arachidonate and were incubated subsequently in the absence and presence of yeast. Following ingestion by control macrophages, arachidonate from phosphatidylcholine was readily cleaved to free fatty acid and transferred to the neutral lipid fraction. In contrast, arachidonate release was inhibited in dexamethasone treated macrophages. These results suggest that the suppression of yeast phagocytosis by dexamethasone action may be associated with the inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity.

Although efforts have been made to understand how these carbohydrate polymers exert their immunomodulatory effects, the receptors involved in generating these responses are unknown. Here we show that Dectin-1 mediates the production of TNF-alpha in response to zymosan and live fungal pathogens, an activity that occurs at the cell surface and requires the cytoplasmic tail and immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif of Dectin-1 as well as Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and Myd88. This is the first demonstration that the inflammatory response to pathogens requires recognition by a specific receptor in addition to the TLRs. Furthermore, these studies implicate Dectin-1 in the production of TNF-alpha in response to fungi, a critical step required for the successful control of these pathogens.

12163569|a|Zymosan is a beta-glucan- and mannan-rich particle that is widely used as a cellular activator for examining the numerous responses effected by phagocytes. The macrophage mannose receptor (MR) and complement receptor 3 (CR3) have historically been considered the major macrophage lectins involved in the nonopsonic recognition of these yeast-derived particles. Using specific carbohydrate inhibitors, we show that a beta-glucan receptor, but not the MR, is a predominant receptor involved in this process. Furthermore, nonopsonic zymosan binding was unaffected by genetic CD11b deficiency or a blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CR3, demonstrating that CR3 was not the beta-glucan receptor mediating this activity. To address the role of the recently described beta-glucan receptor, Dectin-1, we generated a novel anti-Dectin-1 mAb, 2A11. Using this mAb, we show here that Dectin-1 was almost exclusively responsible for the beta-glucan-dependent, nonopsonic recognition of zymosan by primary macro-phages. These findings define Dectin-1 as the leukocyte beta-glucan receptor, first described over 50 years ago, and resolves the long-standing controversy regarding the identity of this important molecule. Furthermore, these results identify Dectin-1 as a new target for examining the immunomodulatory properties of beta-glucans for therapeutic drug design.

9257297|a|The secretion of hydrocortisone by the adrenal cortex is crucial in balancing the reaction of the body to injury or stress. In the periphery, hydrocortisone inhibits inflammation, downregulates the immune system and produces many other crucial physiological and metabolic changes. Within the neuroendocrine system, hydrocortisone inhibits the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (and other pituitary hormones), thereby governing its own secretion. The manifold actions of hydrocortisone are mediated through induction or repression of many genes but one pathway, mediated by the inducible protein lipocortin 1 (LC-1, also known as annexin 1), mediates several important effects both within the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis itself and in the periphery.

7531748|a|The responsiveness of bovine neutrophil L-selectin and CD18 to in vivo glucocorticoid administration was characterized by flow cytometric analysis. Blood was sampled intensively from dairy cows treated for 3 days with placebo, cortisol, or dexamethasone. Immunostaining was performed on whole blood (100 microliters) that was left unstimulated or was stimulated with platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1 microgram/ml blood) prior to incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against L-selectin and CD18. Results were expressed as the percentage of positive-staining cells and as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of those cells. Total leukocyte count and leukocyte differentials were also performed on all blood samples. Dexamethasone caused nearly complete down-regulation of L-selectin (P < .01) on the surface of gated cells and reduced to half the MFI of CD18 (P < .01). Compared with values for the placebo group, dexamethasone began to cause L-selectin down-regulation within 8 h after the first injection and these effects persisted until 48 h after the third injection. This was correlated in time with an acute reduction in the proportion of cells that stained positive for L-selectin (from 98% before dexamethasone injections to a low of 17% by 40 h after the first injection). Dexamethasone also caused leukocytosis and neutrophilia during this time interval. In contrast, CD18 down-regulation was delayed until 16 h after the second dexamethasone injection and persisted for roughly 8 days. However, at no time during the experiment did dexamethasone influence the proportion of gated cells staining positive for CD18 (always 100%). Effects of cortisol were generally similar in pattern to those of dexamethasone but were more subtle and more readily detected when PAF was added to blood prior to immunostaining. These results strongly suggest that one mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids is to induce dramatic down-regulation of L-selectin and CD18 adhesion molecules on blood neutrophils.

7582501|a|1. We have studied the ability of the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, to induce annexin 1 secretion by either human blood monocytes or rat peritoneal leukocytes. 2. The in vivo treatment of rats with dexamethasone (1.25 mg kg-1) selectively induced secretion of annexin 1 by peritoneal leukocytes, as assessed by incubating these cells in culture medium. Annexin 1 secretion was also induced in human cultured monocytes, in vitro, by 10(-6) M dexamethasone. 3. Annexin 1 secretion was inhibited in the presence of 20 mM NH4Cl or by conducting the experiments at 18 degrees C. In contrast, it was not inhibited by monensin, nocodazole or brefeldin A. 4. The time necessary for annexin 1 synthesis and secretion was less than 15 min. 5. These data indicate that glucocorticoids induce annexin 1 secretion by monocytes or peritoneal leukocytes. Because it is not inhibited by monensin, nocodazole or brefeldin A and it is rapid, annexin 1 secretion seems to occur by the secretory pathway similar to that used by several cytosolic proteins such as interleukin-1 beta.

12553880|a|The Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding protein Anx-A1 (annexin 1; lipocortin 1) has been described both as an inhibitor of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity and as a mediator of glucocorticoid-regulated cell growth and eicosanoid generation. Here we show that, when compared with Anx-A1(+/+) cells, lung fibroblast cell lines derived from the Anx-A1(-/-) mouse exhibit an altered morphology characterized by a spindle-shaped appearance and an accumulation of intracellular organelles. Unlike their wild-type counterparts, Anx-A1(-/-) cells also overexpress cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX 2), cytosolic PLA(2) and secretory PLA(2) and in response to fetal calf serum, exhibit an exaggerated release of eicosanoids, which is insensitive to dexamethasone (10(-8)- 10(-6) M) inhibition. Proliferation and serum-induced progression of Anx-A1(+/+) cells from G(0)/G(1) into S phase, and the associated expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) and COX 2, is strongly inhibited by dexamethasone, whereas Anx-A1(-/-) cells are refractory to the drug. Loss of the response to dexamethasone in Anx-A1(-/-) cells occurs against a background of no apparent change in glucocorticoid receptor expression or sensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Taken together, these observations suggest strongly that Anx-A1 functions as an inhibitor of signal-transduction pathways that lead to cell proliferation and may help to explain how glucocorticoids regulate these processes.

9146893|a|1. We have developed a novel model of allergen-induced eosinophil into mouse air-pouches following sensitization and challenge with ovalbumin (Ova). This model was used to investigate the mechanism(s) underlying the anti-inflammatory action of the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone (Dex). 2. Injection of 10 micrograms Ova into 6-day-old dorsal air-pouches of mice sensitized to the same antigen provoked an intense cell accumulation as early as 6 h post-challenge (0.08 +/- 0.03 and 4.0 +/- 1.0 x 10(5) leucocytes in saline and Ova-treated air-pouches, respectively), maximal at 24 h (0.02 +/- 0.01 and 6.0 +/- 0.8 x 10(5) leucocytes in saline and Ova-treated air-pouches, respectively) and persisted up to 48 h. At the 24 h time-point, the cellular infiltrate consisted of 37% eosinophils, 18% neutrophils and 45% mononuclear cells, as assessed by histological examination. The same ratio of eosinophil/neutrophil was obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, since 72% of the polymorphonuclear (PMN) population was positive for very-late antigen-4 (VLA-4) expression. 3. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of Dex (50 or 100 micrograms per mouse, -1 h) inhibited eosinophil accumulation into Ova challenged air-pouches by about 70% (P < 0.05) and 75% (P < 0.05), respectively, when compared to controls. Cell accumulation measured at 48 h after Ova injection was also significantly reduced (-75%) by Dex administration at the 24 h time-point (n = 12, P < 0.05). 4. Eosinophil numbers in the bone marrow and blood were quantitated. We found that the sensitization protocol induced a 3 fold increase in eosinophil numbers in the bone marrow (naive mice: 2.7 +/- 0.3 x 10(5); sensitized mice: 8.7 +/- 1.7 x 10(5), P < 0.05) and blood (naive mice: 0.5 +/- 0.2 x 10(5); sensitized mice: 1.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(5), P < 0.01). However, 24 h following Ova challenge, the eosinophil numbers in the bone marrow had dropped (3.7 +/- 0.8 x 10(5) with no change in the circulating pool, suggesting an equilibrium within the eosinophil pools had been reached. 5. Dex administration provoked a profound eosinopaenia in the blood of naive (5.2 +/- 1.5 to 0.9 +/- 0.6 x 10(4)) and sensitized mice (1.5 +/- 0.3 to 0.08 +/- 0.02 x 10(5)) at 4 h. This effect was reversed within 24 h. Dex also inhibited the release of eosinophils from the bone marrow in response to Ova challenge. 6. We show for the first time that express the steroid-inducible protein lipocortin 1 (LC1). FACS analysis of eosinophils emigrated into the Ova challenged air-pouches revealed detectable LC1-like immunoreactivity (373 x 10(3)). These data were also substantiated by LC1 detection in circulating eosinophils of interleukin-5 transgenic mice (strain: CBA/Ca). However, s.c. injection of Dex (50 micrograms) did not alter LC1 levels in blood eosinophils, such that 235 +/- 21 x 10(3) LC1-like molecules per cell were measured after vehicle treatment (n = 5), and 224 +/- 8 x 10(3) LC1-like molecules per cell were associated with this cell type 1 h after steroid treatment (n = 5, not significant). Finally, resident eosinophils (in the pleural cavity) were found to have much higher LC1 levels than that found in the blood circulation (2 fold increase, P < 0.05). 7. Passive immunization of mice against LC1 with a validated antiserum (termed LCS3) and protocol failed to modify the anti-migratory activity exerted by Dex towards eosinophil extravasation into Ova-challenged air-pouches. The steroid (50 micrograms s.c., -1 h) produced a similar degree of inhibition of eosinophil accumulation both in control animals (treated with a non-immune sheep serum) the LCS3-treated mice (-56% and 59%, respectively, n = 15-21, not significant). 8. In conclusion, the air-pouch provides a novel and convenient cavity to study allergen-induced cell recruitment which is sensitive to glucocorticoid hormone treatment. The effect of Dex on eosinophil distribution in these experimental conditions has been studied in detail and

8125852|a|It has been suggested that the induction of lipocortin-1, a phospholipase A2-inhibitory protein, may mediate the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids. We assessed the production of prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2, and leukotriene B4 and the expression of lipocortin-1 in different populations of blood leukocytes and in alveolar macrophages (obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage) from patients with inflammatory lung diseases (bronchial asthma, n = 21; interstitial lung disease, n = 6) undergoing glucocorticoid treatment at clinically effective doses. No inhibition of eicosanoid production was observed in either whole blood or single populations of blood leukocytes (granulocytes and monocytes) stimulated with ionophore A-23187, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine, or zymosan. Conversely, eicosanoid production from alveolar macrophages (assessed in 9 cases) was significantly inhibited by glucocorticoids. After ionophore stimulation, eicosanoid production was as follows (in ng/ml): prostaglandin E2, 0.19 +/- 0.06 and 0.06 +/- 0.01; thromboxane B2, 2.9 +/- 0.9 and 0.5 +/- 0.1; leukotriene B4, 6.6 +/- 1.1 and 3.6 +/- 1.0, before and after treatment, respectively (P < 0.05 for all differences). Lipocortin-1 expression, determined by Western blot and enzyme immunoassay, was significantly (P < 0.05) stimulated in alveolar macrophages, but not in blood leukocytes, by glucocorticoid treatment. These results indicate that alveolar macrophages, at variance from blood leukocytes, are the most likely cell target for glucocorticoid-induced eicosanoid inhibition and lipocortin expression. We suggest that cell responsiveness to glucocorticoids is acquired during differentiation from monocyte to tissue macrophage.

12379807|a|Phagocytosis of microbes coated with opsonins such as the complement component C3bi is the key activity of neutrophils. However, the mechanism by which opsonins enhance the rate of phagocytosis by these cells is unknown and has been difficult to study, partly because of the problem of observing and quantifying the events associated with phagocytosis. In this study, C3bi-opsonized particles were presented to neutrophils with a micromanipulator, so that the events of binding, pseudopod cup formation, engulfment, and completion of phagocytosis were clearly defined and distinguished from those involved with chemotaxis. Using this approach in combination with simultaneous phase contrast and Ca(2+) imaging, the temporal relationship between changes in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration and phagocytosis were correlated. Here we show that whereas small, localized Ca(2+) changes occur at the site of particle attachment and cup formation as a result of store release, rapid engulfment of the particle required a global change in cytosolic free Ca(2+) which resulted from Ca(2+) influx. This latter rise in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration also liberated a fraction of beta2 integrin receptors which were initially immobile on the neutrophil surface, as demonstrable by both fluorescence recovery after laser bleaching and by visualization of localized beta2 integrin labelling. Inhibitors of calpain activation prevented both the Ca(2+)-induced liberation of beta2 integrin and the rapid stage of phagocytosis, despite the persistence of the global Ca(2+) signal. Therefore, we propose that Ca(2+) activation of calpain causes beta2 integrin liberation, and that this signal plays a key role in the acceleration of beta2 integrin-mediated phagocytosis.

9191044|a|Annexins are a family of structurally related proteins which bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. Although the precise functions of annexins are unknown, there is an accumulating set of data arguing for a role for some of them in vesicular transport and, specifically, in membrane-membrane or membrane-cytoskeletal interactions during these processes. Here we describe our qualitative and quantitative analysis of the localization of annexins I-V in J774 macrophages that had internalized latex beads, both with and without IgG opsonization. Our results show that whereas all these annexins are present on both the plasma membrane and on phagosomes, the localization on other organelles differs. Annexins I, II, III and V were detected on early endosomes, while only annexin V was seen on late endocytic organelles and mitochondria. Annexins I and II distributed along the plasma membrane non-uniformly and co-localized with F-actin at the sites of membrane protrusions. We also investigated by western blot analysis the association of annexins with purified phagosomes isolated at different time-points after latex bead internalization. While the amounts of annexins I, II, III and V associated with phagosomes were similar at all times after their formation, the level of annexin IV was significantly higher on older phagosomes. Whereas annexins I, II, IV and V could be removed from phagosome membranes with a Ca2+ chelator they remained membrane bound under low calcium conditions. In contrast, annexin III was removed under these conditions and needed a relatively high Ca2+ concentration to remain phagosome bound. Because of their purity and ease of preparation we suggest that phagosomes are a powerful system to study the potential role of annexins in membrane traffic.

1919019|a|One of the challenges of phagocytosis research is to differentiate bacteria adherent to a host cell from bacteria which the cell has internalized. To address this question, various techniques such as fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, and flow cytometry have been used. We have adapted a flow cytometric method (Fattorossi et al., 1989) to use fluorescence microscopy for studying phagocytosis of fluorescein-labeled Listeria by inflammatory mouse peritoneal macrophages. In this assay, ethidium bromide is used as a quenching agent and is added to cells after they have phagocytosed labeled bacteria. Ethidium bromide causes extracellular FITC-labeled Listeria to fluoresce red-orange, whereas intracellular bacteria are not exposed to the dye and remain green. This process allows distinction between intracellular and extracellular bacteria by simultaneous visualization of both populations.

10704090|a|Specific binding sites for the anti-inflammatory protein annexin I have been detected on the surface of human monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). These binding sites are proteinaceous in nature and are sensitive to cleavage by the proteolytic enzymes trypsin, collagenase, elastase and cathepsin G. When monocytes and PMN were isolated independently from peripheral blood, only the monocytes exhibited constitutive annexin I binding. However PMN acquired the capacity to bind annexin I following co-culture with monocytes. PMN incubation with sodium azide, but not protease inhibitors, partially blocked this process. A similar increase in annexin I binding capacity was also detected in PMN following adhesion to endothelial monolayers. We propose that a juxtacrine activation rather than a cleavage-mediated transfer is involved in this process. Removal of annexin I binding sites from monocytes with elastase rendered monocytes functionally insensitive to full length annexin I or to the annexin I-derived pharmacophore, peptide Ac2-26, assessed as suppression of the respiratory burst. These data indicate that the annexin I binding site on phagocytic cells may have an important function in the feedback control of the inflammatory response and their loss through cleavage could potentiate such responses.

Monoclonal antibodies against CR3, M1/70 (Mac-1) and MO1, each inhibited approximately 50% of uptake of 125I-zymosan by murine and human M phi, respectively. Yeast mannan inhibited 0-50% of zymosan uptake in various M phi, in parallel with their expression of MFR. We demonstrated that M phi were the source of C3 in our assay and that the activity of other components of the complement system, namely a C3 convertase, factor I, and a factor I cofactor were also present in serum-free cultures of human monocytes. Macrophage C3 was deposited rapidly, within 10 min, on the zymosan particles and mediated binding, ingestion, and stimulation of superoxide release in BCG-activated and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal M phi via CR3. Local secretion of complement proteins by M phi themselves can therefore opsonize pathogens and cells able to activate the alternative pathway and effect their destruction.

The effect of dexamethasone, lipocorton-1(2-26) and an antiserum to lipocortin-1(2-26) (LCPS1) upon the hyperalgesic activities in rats of carrageenin, bradykinin, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-1(2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), prostaglandin E beta (PGE2) and dopamine were investigated in a model of mechanical hyperalgesia. 2. Hyperalgesic responses to intraplantar (i.pl.) injections of carrageenin (100 micrograms), bradykinin (500 ng), TNF alpha (2.5 pg), IL-1 beta (0.5 pg), and IL-6 (1.0 ng), but not responses to IL-8 (0.1 ng), PGE2 (100 ng) and dopamine (10 micrograms), were inhibited by pretreatment with dexamethasone (0.5 mg kg-1, subcutaneously, s.c., or 0.04-5.0 micrograms/paw). 3. Inhibition of hyperalgesic responses to injections (i.pl.) of bradykinin (500 ng) and IL-1 beta (0.5 pg) by dexamethasone (0.5 mg kg-1, s.c.) was reversed by LCPS1 (0.5 ml kg-1, injected s.c., 24 h and 1 h before hyperalgesic substances) and hyperalgesic responses to injections (i.pl.) of bradykinin (500 ng), TNF alpha (2.5 pg) and IL-1 beta (0.5 pg), but not responses to PGE2 (100 ng), were inhibited by pretreatment with lipocortin-1(2-26) (100 micrograms/paw). Also, lipocortin-1(2-26) (30 and 100 micrograms ml-1 and dexamethasone (10 micrograms ml-1) inhibited TNF alpha release by cells of the J774 (murine macrophage-like) cell-line stimulated with LPS (3 micrograms ml-1), and LCPS1 partially reversed the inhibition by dexamethasone. These data are consistent with an important role for endogenous lipocortin-1(2-26) in mediating the anti-hyperalgesic effect of dexamethasone, with inhibiton of TNF alpha production by lipocortin-1(2-26) contributing, in part, to this role. 4. Although arachidonic acid by itself was not hyperalgesic, the hyperalgesic response to IL-1 beta (0.25 pg, i.pl.) was potentiated by arachidonic acid (50 micrograms) and the potentiated response was inhibited by dexamethasone (50 micrograms, i.pl.) and lipocortin-1(2-26) (100 micrograms, i.pl.). Also, lipocortin-1(2-26) (30 and 100 micrograms ml-1) inhibited/abolished PGE2 release by J774 cells stimulated with LPS (3 micrograms ml-1). These data suggest that, in inflammatory hyperalgesia, inhibition of the induction of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2), rather than phospholipase A2, by dexamethasone and lipocortin-1(2-26) accounts for the anti-hyperalgesic effects of these agents. 5. The above data support the notion that induction of lipocortin by dexamethasone plays a major role in the inhibition by dexamethasone of inflammatory hyperalgesia evoked by carrageenin, bradykinin and the cytokines TNF alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6, and provides additional evidence that the biological activity of lipocortin resides within the peptide lipocortin-1(2-26). Further, the data suggest that inhibition of lipocortin-1(2-26) of eicosanoid production by COX-2 also contributes to the anti-hyperalgesic effect of lipocortin-1.

9236448|a|Recent studies have raised the hypothesis that glucocorticoids could diminish the ability of endothelial cells to direct leukocyte traffic into inflamed tissues by inhibiting expression of the adhesion molecules endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether glucocorticoids also regulate the expression of L-selectin and CD11/CD18 integrins on human neutrophil granulocytes.Incubation of human whole blood with platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1 mumol/L) evoked downregulation of L-selectin and upregulation of CD11/CD18 adhesion receptors on neutrophils as measured by flow cytometry. While dexamethasone (0.1 nmol/L to 100 mumol/L) did not affect expression of adhesion molecules on resting neutrophils, it attenuated the PAF-induced changes in L-selectin and CD18 expression in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion with IC50 values of 31 and 13 nmol/L, respectively. These effects of dexamethasone were completely aborted by RU-486 (10 mumol/L), which blocks transcriptional activation of the glucocorticoid receptor, and by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (35.5 mumol/L). Dexamethasone, up to a concentration of 1 mumol/L, neither affected significantly the release of granule enzymes nor interfered with PAF binding to its membrane receptors.Our results show that glucocorticoids at clinically relevant concentrations exert specific actions on expression of adhesion molecules on activated neutrophils, which are mediated through ligation of glucocorticoid receptors and induction of protein synthesis, and suggest a novel mechanism by which anti-inflammatory corticosteroids may inhibit leukocyte accumulation.

8184489|a|Lipocortin-1, a 37 kDa member of the annexin superfamily of proteins, originally evoked interest as one of the 'second messengers' of the anti-inflammatory actions of the glucocorticoids. Subsequent research has shown that the protein plays a major regulatory role in systems as diverse as cell-growth regulation and differentiation, neutrophil migration, CNS responses to cytokines, neuroendocrine secretion and neurodegeneration. The role of lipocortin-1 in mediating glucocorticoid-induced effects in these systems has been demonstrated using immunoneutralization strategies and by mimicking steroid actions with highly purified or recombinant lipocortin-1 or its biologically active peptide fragments. Originally the mode of action of lipocortin-1 seemed to be largely through inhibition of prostaglandin formation, but it is now clear that it can modify other aspects of cell function, perhaps pointing to a more fundamental mechanism than was originally envisaged. In this article Rod Flower and Nancy Rothwell review the nature, possible mechanisms and clinical relevance of these diverse actions of lipocortin-1.

12560218|a|Recent investigations conducted with human neutrophils have indicated an involvement for the receptor for formylated peptides, termed FPR, and its analog FPRL1 (or ALXR because it is the receptor for the endogenous ligand lipoxin A(4)) in the in vitro inhibitory actions of the glucocorticoid-regulated protein annexin 1 and its peptidomimetics. To translate these findings in in vivo settings, we have used an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) procedure to promote leukocyte-endothelium interactions in the mouse mesenteric microcirculation. In naive mice, the annexin 1 mimetic peptide Ac2-26 (20 to 100 microg administered intravenously prior to reperfusion) abolished I/R-induced cell adhesion and emigration, but not cell rolling. In FPR-deficient mice, peptide Ac2-26 retained significant inhibitory actions (about 50% of the effects in naive mice), and these were blocked by an FPR antagonist, termed butyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe, or Boc2. In vitro, neutrophils taken from these animals could be activated at high concentrations of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (30 microM; fMLP), and this effect was blocked by cell incubation with peptide Ac2-26 (66 microM) or Boc2 (100 microM). FPR-deficient neutrophils expressed ALXR mRNA and protein. Both ALXR agonists, lipoxin A(4) and peptide Ac2-26, provoked detachment of adherent leukocytes in naive as well as in FPR-deficient mice, whereas the CXC chemokine KC or fMLP were inactive. The present findings demonstrate that endogenous regulatory autocoids such as lipoxin A(4) and annexin 1-derived peptides function to disengage adherent cells during cell-cell interactions.

11917092|a|Annexins are Ca2+ and phospholipid binding proteins forming an evolutionary conserved multigene family with members of the family being expressed throughout animal and plant kingdoms. Structurally, annexins are characterized by a highly alpha-helical and tightly packed protein core domain considered to represent a Ca2+-regulated membrane binding module. Many of the annexin cores have been crystallized, and their molecular structures reveal interesting features that include the architecture of the annexin-type Ca2+ binding sites and a central hydrophilic pore proposed to function as a Ca2+ channel. In addition to the conserved core, all annexins contain a second principal domain. This domain, which NH2-terminally precedes the core, is unique for a given member of the family and most likely specifies individual annexin properties in vivo. Cellular and animal knock-out models as well as dominant-negative mutants have recently been established for a number of annexins, and the effects of such manipulations are strikingly different for different members of the family. At least for some annexins, it appears that they participate in the regulation of membrane organization and membrane traffic and the regulation of ion (Ca2+) currents across membranes or Ca2+ concentrations within cells. Although annexins lack signal sequences for secretion, some members of the family have also been identified extracellularly where they can act as receptors for serum proteases on the endothelium as well as inhibitors of neutrophil migration and blood coagulation. Finally, deregulations in annexin expression and activity have been correlated with human diseases, e.g., in acute promyelocytic leukemia and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and the term annexinopathies has been coined.

9134220|a|1. The role played by endogenous lipocortin 1 in the anti-migratory action exerted by dexamethasone (Dex) on monocyte recruitment in an in vivo model of acute inflammation was investigated by use of several neutralizing polyclonal antibodies raised against lipocortin 1 or a lipocortin 1-derived N-terminus peptide (peptide Ac2-26). The efficacy of peptide Ac2-26 in inhibiting monocyte and polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN) recruitment was also tested. 2. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of zymosan A (1 mg) produced a time-dependent cell accumulation into mouse peritoneal cavities which followed a typical profile of acute inflammation: PMN influx was maximal at 4 h post-zymosan (between 15 and 20 x 10(6) cells per mouse), and this was followed by an accumulation of monocytes which peaked at the 24 h time-point (between 10 and 15 x 10(6) cells per mouse). 3. Dex administration to mice reduced zymosan-induced 4 h PMN infiltration and 24 h monocyte accumulation with similar efficacy: approximately 50% of inhibition of recruitment of both cell types was achieved at the dose of 30 micrograms per mouse (approximately 1 mg kg-1, subcutaneously (s.c.)). Maximal inhibitions of 64% and 67% on PMN and monocyte recruitment, respectively, were measured after a dose of 100 micrograms per mouse (approximately 3 mg kg-1, s.c.). 4. Dex (30 micrograms s.c.) inhibited monocyte (53%) and PMN (69%) accumulation in response to zymosan application in mice which had been treated with a non-immune sheep serum (50 microliters s.c.). In contrast, the steroid was no longer active in reducing cell accumulation in mice which had been passively immunized against full length human recombinant lipocortin 1 (serum LCS3), or against lipocortin 1 N-terminus peptide. 5. Treatment of mice with vinblastine (1 mg kg-1, intravenously (i.v.)) produced a remarkable leucopenia as assessed 24 h after administration. This was accompanied by a 60% reduction in 4 h-PMN influx, and by a 27% reduction in 24 h-monocyte accumulation, measured after zymosan administration. The inhibitory effect of Dex on monocyte recruitment was not significantly modified in vinblastine-treated mice, with 36% and 57% of inhibition calculated at the dose of 30 micrograms Dex, and 70% and 60% of inhibition at 100 micrograms Dex, in vehicle- and vinblastine-treated mice, respectively. 6. Treatment of mice with peptide Ac2-26 dose-dependently attenuated PMN influx at 4 h post-zymosan with a significant effect at 100 micrograms per mouse (45% of inhibition, n-9, P < 0.05) and a maximal effect of 61% inhibition at the highest dose tested of 200 micrograms s.c. (n = 14, P < 0.05). No effect of peptide Ac2-26 (200 micrograms s.c.) was seen on zymosan-induced 24 h monocyte recruitment. In contrast, administration of 200 micrograms peptide Ac2-26 every 6 h was effective in reducing the number of monocytes harvested from the inflamed peritoneal cavities at 24 h post-zymosan: 9.40 +/- 0.58 x 10(6) monocytes per mouse (n = 13) and 5.74 +/- 0.34 monocytes per mouse (n = 14) in vehicle- and peptide Ac2-26-treated mice, respectively (P < 0.05). 7. Finally, peptide Ac2-26 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the rate of phagocytosis of mouse resident peritoneal macrophages as measured by flow cytometry, with a maximal reduction of 34% at the highest concentration tested of 100 micrograms ml-1 (n = 8 experiments performed in duplicate; P < 0.05). 8. In conclusion, this study suggests that in vivo monocyte recruitment during acute inflammation is, at least in part, under the negative modulatory control of endogenous lipocortin 1 (as seen after administration of Dex by using the specific antisera) and exogenous lipocortin 1 mimetics (as observed with peptide Ac2-26. In addition to the neutrophil, we can now propose that the monocyte also can be a target for the in vivo anti-inflammatory action of lipocortin 1.

7835168|a|Our laboratory recently developed a light microscopy staining technique that provides a mean to distinguish between yeast that are simply bound to the surface of macrophages and yeast that have actually been phagocytized by macrophages (7). We adapted this technique by using fluorescent probes in order to test phagocytic activity by flow cytometry. Thus we are able to distinguish unambiguously extracellular from intracellular yeast during phagocytosis with the fast rate of flow cytometry (approximately 200 cells/s). The fluorescence quenching induced by a 1% tannic acid solution (w/v) can be applied to any FITC-labeled, heat-killed yeast cell or bacteria. The yeast cells already engulfed in the macrophage remain with their native fluorescence (internal and external pH equilibrated by 50 microM monensin 30 min/4 degrees C) protected from the action of tannic acid, a nonmembrane permeable molecule. The results presented here validate this new technique. An application is presented showing the inhibition of endocytosis by cytochalasin-B.

12511873|a|The classical pathway of interferon-gamma-dependent activation of macrophages by T helper 1 (T(H)1)-type responses is a well-established feature of cellular immunity to infection with intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV. The concept of an alternative pathway of macrophage activation by the T(H)2-type cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 has gained credence in the past decade, to account for a distinctive macrophage phenotype that is consistent with a different role in humoral immunity and repair. In this review, I assess the evidence in favour of alternative macrophage activation in the light of macrophage heterogeneity, and define its limits and relevance to a range of immune and inflammatory conditions.

9831319|a|Neutrophils have been implicated in mediating much of the tissue damage associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where they are involved in destruction of both cartilage and bone. Glucocorticoids are powerful anti-inflammatory agents, often used in the treatment of this autoimmune disease. They exert significant inhibitory effects on neutrophil activation and functions, such as chemotaxis, adhesion, transmigration, apoptosis, oxidative burst, and phagocytosis. The mechanisms by which glucocorticoids exert these effects on neutrophils are unclear. Evidence from studies of inflammation in human subjects and animal models suggests that annexin-I an endogenous, glucocorticoid-induced protein also known as lipocortin-1, has a pivotal role in modulating neutrophil activation, transmigratory, and phagocytic functions. Furthermore, we present evidence for altered neutrophil functions in rheumatoid arthritis that correspond to a significantly reduced capacity of these cells to bind annexin-I. A proposed novel pathway for glucocorticoid actions on neutrophils involving annexin-I could explain the development of chronic neutrophil activation in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

12475898|a|The 37-kDa protein annexin 1 (Anx-1; lipocortin 1) has been implicated in the regulation of phagocytosis, cell signaling, and proliferation and is postulated to be a mediator of glucocorticoid action in inflammation and in the control of anterior pituitary hormone release. Here, we report that mice lacking the Anx-1 gene exhibit a complex phenotype that includes an altered expression of other annexins as well as of COX-2 and cPLA2. In carrageenin- or zymosan-induced inflammation, Anx-1-/- mice exhibit an exaggerated response to the stimuli characterized by an increase in leukocyte emigration and IL-1beta generation and a partial or complete resistance to the antiinflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. Anx-1-/- polymorphonuclear leucocytes exhibited increased spontaneous migratory behavior in vivo whereas in vitro, leukocytes from Anx-1-/- mice had reduced cell surface CD 11b (MAC-1) but enhanced CD62L (L-selectin) expression and Anx-1-/- macrophages exhibited anomalies in phagocytosis. There are also gender differences in activated leukocyte behavior in the Anx-1-/- mice that are not seen in the wild-type animals, suggesting an interaction between sex hormones and inflammation in Anx-1-/- animals.

8673068|a|Annexin I is an abundant protein in U937 cells differentiated towards a macrophagic phenotype. These cells become able to kill Escherichia coli, however, the intracellular pathogen Brucella suis, known to interfere with phagosome maturation, multiply in these differentiated cells. We have analysed by confocal and electron microscopy the cellular localization of annexin I during phagocytosis of yeast, non-pathogenic E. coli and the intracellular pathogen B. suis. Using immunocytochemical detections annexin I was found mainly as patches in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells. Upon phagocytosis of yeast or E. coli organisms, annexin I rapidly translocated and concentrated around phagosomes. On the other hand, annexin I was never detected around live B. suis-containing phagosomes. However, when dead brucellae were used, annexin I did translocate to the periphagosomal region. Our results suggest that annexin I could play a role in the molecular mechanism of phagosome maturation, which is impaired by some intracellular pathogens.

6618532|a|The rat monoclonal antibody (ab) 7/4 produced against neutrophil-rich cultured bone-marrow populations defines a polymorphic neutrophil differentiation antigen (ag). Ag 7/4 expression was characterized on cells from C57BL/6 and Swiss PO outbred mice using fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis and radioimmune binding assays. All neutrophils in bone marrow, blood, and inflammatory exudates were labeled by ab 7/4 and appeared to express similar amounts of ag 7/4 quantitated by saturation radioimmune binding assays. However, discrete populations of dimly (8-12% of nucleated cells) and brightly (30-40%) 7/4 labeled cells could be resolved by FACS analysis of bone marrow only. No binding was detected to resident or inflammatory macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast cells and mature erythroid cells in hemopoietic or lymphoid tissues. Nine inbred mouse strains tested expressed high levels of ag 7/4, while six other strains expressed insignificant levels. The expression of ag 7/4 on bone-marrow cells from F1, F2, and backcross generation mice was consistent with control by a single, autosomal dominant gene.

11482905|a|Directed mutagenesis, in the form of deletions and point mutations, was used to investigate the regulatory importance of the N-terminal domain of annexin 1. Wild-type and mutant forms were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) to track their localization and introduced in to J-774A.1 cells by transfection. The fusion of annexin 1 to GFP at the N- or C-terminal end did not alter the cellular distribution or co-localization with phagosomes. The effects of mutations were determined according to these characteristics. The prominent effect resulted from S27E mutation which mimics the phosphorylated state of Ser-27. Although still retaining the granular structures in the cytoplasm, S27E annexin 1 failed to associate with the phagosomal protein complex. This suggests an essential regulatory role of the phosphorylation of residue 27 in annexin 1 function.

10899880|a|Complement receptor type 3 (CR3) was initially described as an opsonic receptor. Subsequently, CR3-mediated lectin-sugar recognition mechanisms have been shown to play a major role in the nonopsonic phagocytosis of several pathogens, among them Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Little is known about the binding and signal transduction mechanisms operating during nonopsonic ingestion through CR3 of different microorganisms. In the present study, we used CHO cells stably transfected with CR3 to show that CR3 was able to mediate internalization of zymosan and pathogenic mycobacteria (Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium avium) but not that of nonpathogenic species (Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium phlei). A combination of mannan and beta-glucan inhibited the phagocytosis of zymosan but had no effect on M. kansasii ingestion. Among six monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the CD11b subunit of CR3 that decreased zymosan ingestion, only three inhibited M. kansasii phagocytosis. In particular, MAbs known to block the CR3 lectin site affected only internalization of zymosan. Using U937 macrophages, we observed that zymosan ingestion through CR3 induced superoxide production measured by cytochrome c reduction and by translocation of the NADPH oxidase cytosolic component p47phox to the phagosomal membrane, whereas phagocytosis of viable or heat-killed M. kansasii did not. Furthermore, lack of superoxide anion production during phagocytosis of M. kansasii was not due to inhibition of NADPH oxidase per se or superoxide anion scavenging. Together, our results indicate that (i) nonopsonic phagocytosis of zymosan and M. kansasii by CR3 implicates different molecular mechanisms involving multiple and distinct epitopes of CD11b and (ii) CR3 may transduce different cellular responses depending on the sites mediating nonopsonic phagocytosis.

10837366|a|In vitro incubation of mouse blood eosinophils with dexamethasone (DEX) resulted in concentration- and time-dependent reduction in CD11b and CD49d cell-surface expression as detected by flow cytometry. This inhibitory effect ranged between 20 and 40% for both integrins, and it was not related to alteration of cell survival. DEX was maximally effective at 1 microM, and it was prevented by coaddition of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 (mifepristone; 10 microM). Budesonide, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone, but not the sex steroids testosterone and progesterone, reduced CD11b and CD49d cell-surface expression to a similar extent. Subchronic treatment of mice with 1 mg/kg DEX again reduced both CD11b and CD49d expression on circulating eosinophils, without alterations in CD11b messenger RNA expression as assessed by polymerase chain reaction analysis. In contrast, membrane but not intracellular protein expression of either CD11b or CD49d was inhibited by eosinophil incubation with DEX in vitro; thus, an interference with exportation of these adhesion molecules to the cell surface is proposed as the mechanism of action of the glucocorticoid. Finally, steroid effects on integrin expression were linked to a reduced eosinophil function as indicated by a lower degree of cell chemotaxis after incubation with DEX, an effect which was again prevented by 10 microM RU486. These observations may explain part of the therapeutic efficacy displayed by glucocorticoid hormones in the clinical control of tissue eosinophilia in allergic disease conditions.

9826735|a|In this study we investigated, using intravital microscopy, how neutrophil extravasation across mouse mesenteric postcapillary venules is inhibited by the glucocorticoid-regulated protein lipocortin (LC; also termed annexin) 1. Intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg of zymosan into mice induced neutrophil rolling on the activated mesenteric endothelium followed by adhesion (maximal at 2 hr: 5-6 cells per 100-micrometers of vessel length) and emigration (maximal at 4 hr: 8-10 cells per high-powered field). Treatment of mice with human recombinant LC1 (2 mg/kg s.c.) or its mimetic peptide Ac2-26 (13 mg/kg s.c.) did not modify cell rolling but markedly reduced (>/=50%) the degree of neutrophil adhesion and emigration (P < 0.05). Intravenous treatment with peptide Ac2-26 (13 mg/kg) or recombinant human LC1 (0.7-2 mg/kg) promoted detachment of neutrophils adherent to the endothelium 2 hr after zymosan administration, with adherent cells detaching within 4.12 +/- 0.75 min and 2.36 +/- 0.31 min, respectively (n = 20-25 cells). Recruitment of newly adherent cells to the endothelium was unaffected. The structurally related protein LC5 was inactive in this assay, whereas a chimeric molecule constructed from the N terminus of LC1 (49 aa) attached to the core region of LC5 produced cell detachment with kinetics similar to LC1. Removal of adherent neutrophils from activated postcapillary endothelium is a novel pharmacological action, and it is at this site where LC1 and its mimetics operate to down-regulate this aspect of the host inflammatory response.

2542378|a|Glucocorticoids inhibit superoxide (O2-) generation by phagocytes through a mechanism that remains unclear. We investigated this effect by using dexamethasone on guinea pig alveolar macrophages. O2- generation was induced either by the calcium ionophore A23187, a potent stimulus of phospholipase A2, or by the protein kinase C activator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Dexamethasone inhibited O2- generation initiated by A23187 by 50-55%. This inhibition required: (a) more than 45 min incubation and was maximal after 2 h; (b) glucocorticoid receptor occupancy; and (c) protein synthesis. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone could not be explained by an interaction with the respiratory burst enzyme NADPH oxidase since O2- generation was only weakly affected upon PMA stimulation. Lipocortin I, a glucocorticoid inducible and phospholipase A2 inhibitory protein, inhibited O2- generation initiated by A23187 but failed to modulate the respiratory burst activated by PMA. These results were obtained with lipocortin I purified from mouse lungs, human blood mononuclear cells, and with human recombinant lipocortin I. We propose that lipocortin I is capable of inhibiting the activation of NADPH oxidase only when membrane signal transduction involves phospholipase A2. By mimicking the effect of dexamethasone, lipocortin I may extend its potential anti-inflammatory action to the partial control of the formation of oxygen reactive species by phagocytes.

10217523|a|1. Activated microglial cells are believed to play an active role in most brain pathologies, during which they can contribute to host defence and repair but also to the establishment of tissue damage. These actions are largely mediated by microglial secretory products, among which are prostaglandins (PGs) and nitric oxide (NO). 2. The anti-inflammatory protein, lipocortin 1 (LC1) was reported to have neuroprotective action and to be induced by glucocorticoids in several brain structures, with a preferential expression in microglia. In this paper we tested whether the neuroprotective effect of LC1 could be explained by an inhibitory effect on microglial activation. 3. We have previously shown that bacterial endotoxin (LPS) strongly stimulates PGE2 and NO production in rat primary microglial cultures, by inducing the expression of the key enzymes cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), respectively. 4. Dexamethasone (DEX, 1-100 nM) and LC1-derived N-terminus peptide (peptide Ac2-26, 1-100 microg ml(-1)) dose-dependently inhibited the production of both PGE2 and NO from LPS-stimulated microglia. The inhibitory effects of DEX on NO and of the peptide on NO and PGE2 synthesis were partially abrogated by a specific antiserum, raised against the N-terminus of human LC1. The peptide Ac2-26 did not affect arachidonic acid release from control and LPS-stimulated microglial cultures. 5. Western blot experiments showed that the LPS-induced expression of COX-2 and iNOS was effectively down-regulated by DEX (100 nM) and peptide Ac2-26 (100 microg ml(-1)). 6. In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that LC1 may foster neuroprotection by limiting microglial activation, through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.

11005211|a|The presence and localization of the anti-inflammatory protein annexin 1 (also known as lipocortin 1) in perivenular rat mast cells was investigated here. Using the rat mesenteric microvascular bed and a combination of morphologic techniques ranging from immunofluorescence to electron microscopy analyses, we detected the presence of annexin 1 in discrete intracellular sites, both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. In resting mast cells, most of the protein pool (approximately 80% of the cytosolic portion) was localized to cytoplasmic granules. In agreement with other cell types, treatment of rats with dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg, ip) increased annexin 1 expression in mast cells, inducing a remarkable appearance of clusters of protein immunoreactivity. This effect was most likely the result of de novo protein synthesis as determined by an increase in mRNA seen by in situ hybridization. Triggering an ongoing experimental inflammatory response (0.3 mg of carrageenin, ip) increased annexin 1 mRNA and protein levels. In conclusion, we report for the first time the localization of annexin 1 in connective tissue mast cells, and its susceptibility not only to glucocorticoid hormone treatment, but also to an experimental acute inflammatory response.

8428216|a|1. We have studied the occurrence, distribution and disposition of lipocortins (annexins) 1, 2 and 5 in mixed peritoneal leucocytes obtained from rats in which glucocorticoid levels were altered by adrenalectomy, administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist, RU486, or by injection of dexamethasone or hydrocortisone, as well as from rats in which the peritoneal cells were elicited by inflammatory stimuli. 2. In cells obtained from untreated rats with an intact adrenal cortex, lipocortins 1, 2 and 5 were readily detectable: the majority of each of the proteins was apparently located intracellularly with much smaller amounts in the membrane. Lipocortin 1 and to a lesser extent lipocortin 5 were also seen in a Ca(2+)-dependent association with the external plasma membrane. Following administration of RU486 (2 x 20 mg kg-1) the amounts of lipocortin 1 and 2 in cells were greatly reduced. Conversely, injection of hydrocortisone (1 mg kg-1) or dexamethasone (0.08 mg kg-1) caused an increase in the amount of lipocortin 1 and 2 in peritoneal cells within 30 min. Lipocortin 5 was unchanged by any manipulation of glucocorticoid levels. 3. Lipocortins 1 and 2 were elevated in both intracellular and membrane-associated fractions of macrophages elicited by intraperitoneal injection in inflammogens. This phenomenon also occurred in adrenalectomized animals. 4. Our data indicate that glucocorticoids control the synthesis of some members of the lipocortin family in rat mixed peritoneal cells but also suggest the existence of a separate system for controlling the generation of this protein. The significance of these observations is considered in relation to the mechanism of glucocorticoid hormone action on eicosanoid production.

9792213|a|1. Migration of blood-derived leukocytes to tissue sites of inflammation is a hallmark of the response that the host organizes to counteract an insult or a trauma or an infection. A cascade of events is then activated to allow interaction between the leukocyte and the endothelium of postcapillary venule, and this cascade is finely regulated such that mechanisms of negative control are operating side by side with pathways that promote and sustain the extravasation process. Examples of both these positive and negative regulatory systems are discussed here. 2. In vivo accumulation of specific subtypes of leukocytes in response to application of selective chemokines operates through an indirect mechanism that includes the perivenular mast cell and, in particular, the mast cell-derived amines, such as histamine and serotonin. In fact, treatments of animals with (1) histamine H1 or serotonin antagonists or with (2) the mast cell stabilizer cromolyn or with (3) prior depletion of intact mast cells are maneuvers that successfully reduce eosinophil, neutrophil and monocyte extravasation in response to eotaxin, interleukin-8 or monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively. A model in which histamine provides a P-selectin-dependent rolling phenomenon is then postulated. 3. The discovery that neutrophil-derived lipocortin 1 acts as an autocrine mediator with an inhibitory action on the emigration (diapedesis) process confirms the growing body of experimental data that showed that exogenously administered lipocortin 1 and lipocortin 1 mimetics (peptide Ac2-26) potently inhibit neutrophil extravasation in response to different stimuli. Externalization of lipocortin 1 on the plasma membrane of adherent neutrophils reduces their rate of passage through the endothelial gaps. Because cell-associated lipocortin 1 levels are under the partial control of corticosterone (endogenous circulating glucocorticoid hormone in rodents) and dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone with a potent anti-inflammatory profile), a model is proposed in which a balance between anti-inflammatory (lipocortin 1, etc.) and pro-inflammatory (adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines) mediators explains the difference in the rate of leukocyte accumulation during the different stages of the host inflammatory response. 4. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the importance of in vivo experimental systems as a valid way of obtaining pertinent observations and reiterates the importance of negative regulatory mechanisms on the leukocyte extravasation process operating within the host.

8898757|a|Polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) migration into sites of inflammation is fundamental to the host defense response. Activation of endothelial cells and PMNs increases the expression or activation of adhesion molecules, culminating in rolling and subsequent adherence of these cells to the vascular wall. Further activation of adherent PMNs, possibly by endothelial cell ligands, leads, within a few minutes, to extravasation itself. This process is not clearly understood, but adhesion molecules or related proteins, as well as endogenous chemokines, may play an important role. The anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids delay extravasation, which implies that an inhibitory regulatory system exists. Resting PMNs contain abundant cytoplasmic lipocortin 1 (LC1, also called annexin I)', and the activity profile of this protein suggests that it could reduce PMN responsiveness. To investigate this we have assessed neutrophil transmigration both in vivo and in vitro and examined the content and subcellular distribution of LC1 in PMNs by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) analysis, western blotting and confocal microscopy. We report that LC1 is mobilized and externalized following PMN adhesion to endothelial monolayers in vitro or to venular endothelium in vivo and that the end point of this process is a negative regulation of PMN transendothelial passage.

8762084|a|1. Lipocortin 1 (LC1) immunoreactivity in murine peripheral blood leukocytes was quantified by use of a flow cytometric technique associated with a permeabilisation protocol with saponin. Using specific antisera raised against the whole protein or against its N-terminus peptide, cell-associated LC1-like immunoreactivity was easily detected in circulating neutrophils and monocytes, whereas very low levels were found in lymphocytes. Of the total protein measured 17.6% and 36% were associated with the external plasma membrane in neutrophils and monocytes, as assessed in the absence of cell permeabilisation, whereas no signal was detected on lymphocyte plasma membrane. 2. Treatment of mice with dexamethasone (Dex; 0.5-5 micrograms per mouse corresponding to approximately 0.015-1.5 mg kg-1) increased LC1 levels in neutrophils and monocytes. The 2-3 fold increase in LC1 levels was time-dependent with a peak at 2 h. Treatment of mice with the steroid antagonist, RU486 (two doses of 20 mg kg-1 orally) decreased LC1-like immunoreactivity in all three types of circulating leukocytes by > or = 50%. 3. Extravasation of blood neutrophils into inflamed tissue sites resulted in a consistent reduction (> or = 50%) in LC1 levels compared with circulating neutrophils. A high LC1-like immunoreactivity was also measured in resident macrophages, of which approximately one third was membrane-associated. Induction of an acute inflammatory response in the murine peritoneal cavity did not modify total LC1 levels measured in macrophages, but reduced membrane-associated LC1 to a significant extent, i.e. up to 70%. 4. In conclusion, flow cytometric analysis is a rapid and convenient method for detecting and measuring LC1 in murine leukocytes. We confirmed that LC1 protein expression is controlled by exogenous and endogenous glucocorticoids. Amongst other factor(s) influencing protein concentrations, extravasation was found to be associated with a reduced LC1 expression in the emigrated cells.

10408367|a|Complement (C) has two major effector systems available for host defense. The membrane attack complex (MAC) generated from components C5-C9 can form membrane-penetrating lesions that lead to cell death by causing a rapid loss of cytoplasmic components. The MAC is only effective against pathogens with outer phospholipid membranes, and cannot kill gram-positive bacteria or yeast whose membranes are protected by cell walls. The most important effector mechanism of C is the opsonization of microbial pathogens with the serum protein C3 that leads to their high avidity attachment to the C3-receptors of phagocytic cells. Pathogens that activate complement are first coated with the C3b fragment of C3, which is rapidly proteolyzed into the iC3b fragment by serum factor I. These iC3b fragments serve to promote the high avidity attachment of the 'iC3b-opsonized' pathogens to the iC3b-receptors (CR3, CD11b/CD18) of phagocytic cells and natural killer (NK) cells, stimulating phagocytosis and/or cytotoxic degranulation. Host cells, including neoplastic tumor cells, have been endowed with natural mechanisms for self-protection against both the MAC and the cytotoxic activation of CR3. This review discusses a novel type of immunotherapy for cancer that uses soluble yeast beta-glucan to override the normal resistance of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells to the cytotoxic activation of phagocyte and NK cell CR3, allowing this important effector mechanism of the C system to function against tumor cells in the same way that it normally functions against bacteria and yeast. Moreover, the cytotoxic activation of beta-glucan-primed NK cell CR3 by iC3b-opsonized tumors is shown to be accompanied by a tumor-localized secretion of the cytokines TNFalpha, IFNalpha, IFNgamma, and IL-6.

12516535|a|The 37kDa protein annexin 1 (Anx-1; lipocortin 1) is a glucocorticoid-regulated protein that has been implicated in the regulation of phagocytosis, cell signalling and proliferation, and postulated to be a mediator of glucocorticoids action in inflammation and in the control of anterior pituitary hormone release. Immuno-neutralisation or antisense strategies support this hypothesis as they can reverse the effect of glucocorticoids in several systems. We recently generated a line of mice lacking the Anx-1 gene noting that some tissues taken from such animals exhibited an increased expression of several proteins including COX-2 and cPLA2. In models of experimental inflammation, Anx-1(-/-) mice exhibit an exaggerated response and a partial or complete resistance to the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. Several other anomalies were noted including abnormal leukocyte adhesion molecule expression, an increased spontaneous migratory behaviour of PMN in Anx-1(-/-) mice and a resistance in Anx-1(-/-) macrophages to glucocorticoid inhibition of superoxide generation. This paper reviews these and other data in the light of the development of the 'second messenger' hypothesis of glucocorticoid action.

8002935|a|The annexins are Ca(2+)-regulated, phospholipid-binding proteins which have been suggested to take part in cellular events such as exocytosis. The subcellular localization of annexins in human neutrophils was determined using monoclonal antibodies against annexins I, II, IV and VI and a polyclonal peptide antiserum against an annexin consensus sequence. Several annexins were translocated to the light membrane fraction enriched in plasma membranes and secretory vesicles. Annexins were associated also with the azurophil and specific granules. Whereas annexins I, IV and VI and one unidentified 35 kDa protein translocated to each of the isolated organelles, annexin II, a 66 kDa annexin IV-like protein, and a 38 kDa annexin I-like protein exhibited organelle-related differences in their association with membranes. The 38 kDa annexin associated only with specific granules and the secretory vesicles/plasma membrane but not with azurophil granules. Annexin II and the 66 kDa annexin IV-like protein associated with each of the neutrophil organelles, but the binding to specific granules and secretory vesicles/plasma membrane showed a Ca(2+)-dependency different from that of azurophil granules. This observation suggests that these proteins may contribute to the secretory process in neutrophils.

10465305|a|It is now well established that lipocortin 1 (LC1) plays an important role as a mediator of early delayed glucocorticoid feedback action in the hypothalamo-hypophysial system. In both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland, LC1 mimics some of the actions of glucocorticoids; moreover, glucocorticoids stimulate the synthesis of LC1 and cause the translocation of intracellular LC1 to the outer cell surface. The mechanism by which LC1 acts in these tissues is only partially understood, but may involve paracrine and/or autocrine actions. To address these possibilities we have investigated the localization of LC1 in the rat pituitary gland, using double labeling immunohistochemistry to identify the pituitary cell types that express LC1. At the light microscopic level LC1 was not detected in the endocrine cells in cryosections of the pituitary, but it was found in abundance in the surrounding folliculo-stellate (FS) cells. In the anterior and interme diate pituitary lobes, there was a near total colocalization of LC1 and S100, a specific marker of FS cells. By contrast, in the posterior pituitary gland, LC1 immunoreactivity was not colocalized with S100 which labeled most pituicytes, or with OX-42 monoclonal antibody, a marker of the microglial cells. Immunogold electron microscopy confirmed that LC1 is present in the nongranulated FS cells. LC1 im munoreactivity was also present in a mouse pituitary FS-like cell line (TtT/GF), particularly in the periphery of the cytoplasm. The localization of LC1 in the FS cells of the anterior pituitary gland defines LC1 as a new marker of the FS cell population. These results support our hypothesis that LC1 acts as one of the paracrine agents liberated by FS cells that modulate the release of pituitary hormones.

10548109|a|Macrophages orchestrate innate immunity by phagocytosing pathogens and coordinating inflammatory responses. Effective defence requires the host to discriminate between different pathogens. The specificity of innate immune recognition in Drosophila is mediated by the Toll family of receptors; Toll mediates anti-fungal responses, whereas 18-wheeler mediates anti-bacterial defence. A large number of Toll homologues have been identified in mammals, and Toll-like receptor 4 is critical in responses to Gram-negative bacteria. Here we show that Toll-like receptor 2 is recruited specifically to macrophage phagosomes containing yeast, and that a point mutation in the receptor abrogates inflammatory responses to yeast and Gram-positive bacteria, but not to Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, during the phagocytosis of pathogens, two classes of innate immune receptors cooperate to mediate host defence: phagocytic receptors, such as the mannose receptor, signal particle internalization, and the Toll-like receptors sample the contents of the vacuole and trigger an inflammatory response appropriate to defence against the specific organism.

10603493|a|Resolution of inflammation involves the clearance of excess or effete inflammatory cells by a process of physiological programmed cell death (apoptosis) and the subsequent recognition and removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytes. The therapeutic induction of apoptosis for the resolution of chronic inflammation and the general pharmacology of apoptosis have become subjects of increasing interest. In this article, some of the unique and important differences in the control of apoptosis of various inflammatory cells (particularly neutrophil and eosinophil granulocytes) are highlighted. It is suggested that apoptosis can be specifically regulated pharmacologically and could be exploited to develop new drug therapies.

7536934|a|Administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 mg/kg i.v.) to male Wistar rats caused within 240 min (i) a sustained fall (approximately 30 mmHg) in mean arterial blood pressure, (ii) a reduction (> 75%) in the pressor responses to norepinephrine (1 microgram/kg i.v.), and (iii) an induction of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as measured in the lung. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg i.p. at 2 h prior to LPS) attenuated the hypotension and the vascular hyporeactivity to norepinephrine and reduced (by approximately 77%) the expression of iNOS in the lung. These effects of dexamethasone were prevented by pretreatment of LPS-treated rats with a neutralizing antiserum to lipocortin 1 (anti-LC1; 60 mg/kg s.c. at 24 h prior to LPS) but not by a control nonimmune sheep serum. Stimulation of J774.2 macrophages with LPS (1 microgram/ml for 24 h) caused the expression of iNOS and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) protein and significantly increased nitrite generation; this was prevented by dexamethasone (0.1 microM at 1 h prior to LPS), which also increased cell surface lipocortin 1. Pretreatment of J774.2 cells with anti-LC1 (1:60 dilution at 4 h prior to LPS) also abolished the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on iNOS expression and nitrite accumulation but not that on COX-2 expression. A lipocortin 1 fragment (residues 1-188 of human lipocortin 1; 20 micrograms/ml at 1 h prior to LPS) also blocked iNOS in J774.2 macrophages activated by LPS (approximately 78% inhibition), and this too was prevented by anti-LC1. We conclude that the extracellular release of endogenous lipocortin 1 (i) mediates the inhibition by dexamethasone of the expression of iNOS, but not of COX-2, and (ii) contributes substantially to the beneficial actions of dexamethasone in rats with endotoxic shock.

8537402|a|When a mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was cultured in the presence of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), the release of prostaglandin E2 and the cyclooxygenase activity increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The increase of the enzyme activity was attributed mostly to the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 rather than cyclooxygenase-1 as judged by the inhibitory effect of NS398, Western blotting, and Northern blotting. In this system we attempted to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of the cyclooxygenase-2 gene. As examined by the luciferase assay, two positive regulatory regions (-186 to -131 and -512 to -385 base pairs) were found in the 5'-flanking promoter region of the mouse cyclooxygenase-2 gene in the TNF alpha-stimulated cells. The former included putative NF-IL6 (C/EBP beta) and AP2 elements, and the latter contained the NF kappa B motif. A DNA probe including the NF-IL6 and AP2 sites gave positive bands upon electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the nuclear extracts of MC3T3-E1 cells. The bands were supershifted by the addition of anti-NF-IL6 antibody but not by anti-AP2 antibody. A probe including the NF kappa B site also gave positive bands, which were supershifted by anti-NF kappa B p50 and p65 antibodies. Furthermore, when the motif of NF-IL6 or NF kappa B or both was subjected to point mutation, the luciferase activity was markedly reduced. These data suggested a potential role of both NF-IL6 and NF kappa B in the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by TNF alpha.

We report here the purification of a PGG-glucan-binding element from human leukocytes and its identification as lactosylceramide, a major glycosphingolipid of neutrophils, which includes the CDw17 epitope. The binding of radiolabeled PGG-glucan to purified lactosylceramide was saturable, specific, and time- and temperature-dependent. Lactosylceramides from human leukocytes were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography in order to analyze the effect of ceramide structure on binding. A variety of fatty acid chain lengths with varying degrees of unsaturation were found to support binding to radiolabeled PGG-glucan. However, DL-lactosylceramides containing dihydrosphingosine did not bind. Radiolabeled PGG-glucan bound several other neutral glycosphingolipids with a terminal galactose, including galactosylceramide, globotriaosylceramide, and gangliotetraosylceramide. The binding of radiolabeled PGG-glucan to lactosylceramide was not inhibited by glycogen, dextran, mannan, pustulan, laminarin, or a low molecular weight beta-(1-3)-glucan, but was inhibited by high molecular weight beta-(1-3)-glucans and by a monoclonal antibody to lactosylceramide. Although this glycosphingolipid has been shown in numerous reports to bind various microorganisms, this represents the first report of lactosylceramide binding to a macromolecular carbohydrate.

7956833|a|The copulatory structure of the C. elegans male tail includes a set of nine bilaterally symmetrical pairs of sense organs known as rays. Each ray comprises three cells, which are generated by a stereotyped cell sublineage expressed by 18 epidermal ray precursor cells. A pattern formation mechanism in the epidermis guides the specification of morphogenetic differences between the rays necessary for correct organelle assembly at specific positions within the epidermis. Expression of these ray differences was altered in mutations we described previously, resulting in displaced and fused rays. Here we show that two genes of the C. elegans HOM-C/Hox gene complex play a role in the pattern formation mechanism. Increasing or decreasing the gene dosage of mab-5, an Antennapedia homolog, and egl-5, an Abdominal B homolog, results in displacement and fusion of specific rays. These changes are interpreted as anterior or posterior transformations in ray identities. Mutations in the genes previously described are dominant modifiers of these effects. This suggests that these genes act in the same morphogenetic pathway as mab-5 and egl-5. Several lines of evidence, including cell ablation experiments, argue that the identity of each ray is specified cell-autonomously in the terminal cells of the ray lineages. mab-5 and egl-5, therefore, specify the morphogenetic properties of differentiating cells, without change in cell lineage or apparent cell type. Modifier genes may act upstream of mab-5 and egl-5 to regulate their expression. Alternatively, they may act at the same step in the pathway, as cofactors, or they may be target genes. Target genes could include genes specifying cell recognition and adhesion molecules governing ray organelle assembly.

8582275|a|The gene mab-21, which encodes a novel protein of 386 amino acids, is required for the choice of alternate cell fates by several cells in the C. elegans male tail. Three cells descended from the ray 6 precursor cell adopt fates of anterior homologs, and a fourth, lineally unrelated hypodermal cell is transformed into a neuroblast. The affected cells lie together in the lateral tail epidermis, suggesting that mab-21 acts as part of a short-range pattern-formation mechanism. Each of the changes in cell fate brought about by mab-21 mutants can be interpreted as a posterior-to-anterior homeotic transformation. mab-21 mutant males and hermaphrodites have additional pleiotropic phenotypes affecting movement, body shape and fecundity, indicating that mab-21 has functions outside the tail region of males. We show that the three known alleles of mab-21 are hypomorphs of a new gene. Mosaic analysis revealed that mab-21 acts cell autonomously to specify the properties of the sensory ray, but non-autonomously in the hypodermal versus neuroblast cell fate choice. Presence of cell signalling in the choice of the neuroblast fate was confirmed by cell ablation experiments. Mutations in mab-21 were shown previously to be genetic modifiers of the effects of HOM-C/Hox gene mutations on ray identity specification. The results presented here support the conclusion that mab-21 acts as part of a mechanism required for correct cell fate choice, possibly involving the function of HOM-C/Hox genes in several body regions.

8733127|a|The two most consistent features of the diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion-neuropsychiatric symptoms and the phenomenon of genetic anticipation-may be present in forms of dementia, hereditary ataxia, Parkinsonism, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia and autism. To identify candidate genes for these disorders, we have screened human brain cDNA libraries for the presence of gene fragments containing polymorphic trinucleotide repeats. Here we report the cDNA cloning of CAGR1, originally detected in a retinal cDNA library. The 2743 bp cDNA contains a 1077 bp open reading frame encoding 359 amino acids. This amino acid sequence is homologous (56% amino acid identify and 81% amino acid conservation) to the Caenorhabditis elegans cell fate-determining protein mab-21. CAGR1 is expressed in several human tissues, most prominently in the cerebellum, as a message of approximately 3.0 kb. The gene was mapped to 13q13, just telomeric to D13S220. A 5'-untranslated CAG trinucleotide repeat is highly polymorphic, with repeat length ranging from six to 31 triplets and a heterozygosity of 87-88% in 684 chromosomes from several human populations. One allele from an individual with an atypical movement disorder and bipolar affective disorder type II contains 46 triplets, 15 triplets longer than any other allele detected. Though insufficient data are available to link the long repeat to this clinical phenotype, an expansion mutation of the CAGR1 repeat can be considered a candidate for the etiology of disorders with anticipation or developmental abnormalities, and particularly any such disorders linked to chromosome 13.

There are two previous reports of chromosome 13 abnormalities in patients with autism. The deletion in the subject described in this paper maps between the two chromosome 13 linkage peaks described by Bradford et al. (2001) in studies of subjects with autism and language deficits. The 9-Mb region deleted in the patient described here contains at least four genes that are expressed in brain and that play a role in brain development. They are NBEA, MAB21L1, DCAMKL1 and MADH9. These genes therefore represent candidate genes for autism and specific language deficits.

10349626|a|A multitude of regulatory genes are involved in phylogenetically conserved developmental cascades required for the patterning, cell-type specification, and differentiation of specific central nervous system (CNS) structures. Here, we describe the distribution of a mouse transcript encoding a homolog of the C. elegans mab-21 gene. In the nematode tail, mab-21 is required for the short-range patterning and cell-fate determination events mediated by egl-5 and mab-18, two homeobox genes homologous to Abd-B and Pax6, respectively. In mouse midgestation embryogenesis, Mab21 is expressed at its highest levels in the rhombencephalon, cerebellum, midbrain, and prospective neural retina. Our data and the genetic interactions previously documented in the nematode suggest that Mab21 may represent a novel, important regulator of mammalian cerebellum and eye development.

The expanding mab-21 gene family, which is strikingly conserved in evolution, includes two putative Drosophila members. The two mammalian genes, encoding 41 kDa nuclear basic proteins, are expressed in partially overlapping territories in the embryonic brain, eye and limbs, as well as in neural crest derivatives. Recent genetic data implicating mab-21 as a downstream target of TGF-beta signaling, together with the distribution of mab-21 transcripts in the mouse embryo, propose these novel genes as relevant factors in various aspects of vertebrate neural development.

Whole mount in situ hybridization data from embryonic day 8.5 to day 15 revealed that Mab21l2 expression patterns partially overlapped with that of Mab21l1. In addition, its strong expression in the mid- and hindbrain, otic vesicle, optic vesicle, maxillary and mandibular process, paraxial mesoderm, dorsal midline, limb bud and developing digits suggest that Mab21l2 has more diverse functions in vertebrate development.

We showed that its expression in Xenopus was initiated at gastrulation and prominent signal was detected in neurulating embryos at the neural tube, the optic tissue, the developing midbrain, and the pharyngeal pouches.

11677058|a|Random screening for tissue specific genes in zebrafish by in situ hybridization led us to isolate a gene which showed highly restricted expression in the developing eyes and midbrain at somitogenesis stages. This gene was very similar to mouse and human mab21l2. The characteristic expression pattern of mab21l2 facilitates a detailed description of the morphogenesis of the eyes and midbrain in the zebrafish. In the eye field, mab21l2 expression illustrates the transformation of the eye field to form two separate eyes in the anterior neural plate. Mab21l2 staining in the cyclopic mutants, cyc and oep, exhibited incomplete splitting of the eye primodium. In the midbrain, mab21l2 is expressed in the tectum, and its expression follows the expansion of the tectal region. In mutants affecting the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB), mab21l2 expression is affected differentially. In the noi/pax2.1 mutant, mab21l2 is down-regulated and the size of the tectum remains small, whereas in the ace/fgf8 mutant, mab21l2 expression persists although the shape of the tectum is altered.

Similarly, vertebrate homologs of this gene have been shown to express in the craniofacial tissues, limb bud and neural tissues. We report here the cloning and expression analysis of two zebrafish mab21 genes. Both genes have a conserved open reading frame of 1080 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the two family subgroups existed prior to the divergence of vertebrates. Their expression profiles revealed that mab21l1 was turned on in embryos as early as 8 h post-fertilization (hpf) while mab21l2 was first detected at around 11 hpf. In situ hybridization results showed that expression of these mab21 genes marked the early differentiating olfactory bulbs, eye primordia, midbrain and subsequently the branchial pouches and neural tube.

11857508|a|The nematode mab-21 gene specifies sensory ray cell identity and was first isolated because of its mutant sensory ray defects. Vertebrate Mab21 orthologs have since been identified in mammals and amphibians. In this report, we characterized in detail two Mab21 orthologs in mouse, Mab21l1 and Mab21l2.We examined the genomic organizations of Mab21 genes and used northern blot and in situ hybridizations to assay their temporal-spatial expression pattern. Their embryonic functions were revealed by specific attenuation of Mab21 messages with antisense oligos in cultured embryos.Mab21l1 and Mab21l2 have very similar protein make-up and gene structures. Both genes were expressed in overlapping domains of actively differentiating embryonic tissues. In addition, Mab21l1 had unique expression in the lens vesicles and genital tubercle whereas Mab21l2 was expressed in the retinal epithelium and umbilical cord. Mab21l1 and Mab21l2 depleted embryos had severe defects in notochord, neural tube, organogenesis, vasculogenesis, and axial turning.The findings demonstrate that both Mab21 genes are required in developing embryos for embryonic turning, formation of the notochord, neural tube, and other organ tissues.

12642482|a|The mab-21 gene was first identified because of its requirement for ray identity specification in Caenorhabditis elegans. It is now known to constitute a family of genes that are highly conserved from vertebrates to invertebrates, and two homologs, Mab21l1 and Mab21l2, have been identified in many species. We describe the generation of Mab21l1-deficient mice with defects in eye and preputial gland formation. The mutant mouse eye has a rudimentary lens resulting from insufficient invagination of the lens placode caused by deficient proliferation. Chimera analyses suggest that the lens placode is affected in a cell-autonomous manner, although Mab21l1 is expressed in both the lens placode and the optic vesicle. The defects in lens placode development correlate with delayed and insufficient expression of Foxe3, which is also required for lens development, while Maf, Sox2, Six3 and PAX6 levels are not significantly affected. Significant reduction of Mab21l1 expression in the optic vesicle and overlying surface ectoderm in Sey homozygotes indicates that Mab21l1 expression in the developing eye is dependent upon the functions of Pax6 gene products. We conclude that Mab21l1 expression dependent on PAX6 is essential for lens placode growth and for formation of the lens vesicle; lack of Mab21l1 expression causes reduced expression of Foxe3 in a cell-autonomous manner.

15183718|a|Two alleles of an eyeless mutant, chokh (chk), were identified in ongoing zebrafish F(3) mutagenesis screens. Morphologically, chk mutants can be identified at 15 h post-fertilization by the failure of optic primordia to evaginate from the forebrain. The chk phenotype appears specific, as marker genes in the forebrain, midbrain, and pineal are expressed in normal temporal, spatial, and circadian patterns. Sequence analysis of the chk alleles revealed nonsense or missense mutations in the rx3 homeobox. Rx genes encode paired-type homeodomain transcription factors known to be key regulators of eye development in mouse, medaka, Xenopus, and zebrafish. To uncover novel Rx targets, we analyzed the expression of multiple eye development genes in chk. We find that expression of mab21l2, mab21l1 and rx2 are specifically absent in the eye field of chk embryos. Knockdown of Mab21l2 by antisense morpholino microinjections partially phenocopies the rx3 mutation, leading to microphthalmia, incomplete eye maturation, and dramatic increases in apoptotic eye progenitors. We propose that mab21l2 is an early downstream effector of rx3 and is critical for survival of eye progenitors.

10021351|a|We have identified a new member of the TGF-beta superfamily, CET-1, from Caenorhabditis elegans, which is expressed in the ventral nerve cord and other neurons. cet-1 null mutants have shortened bodies and male tail abnormal phenotype resembling sma mutants, suggesting cet-1, sma-2, sma-3 and sma-4 share a common pathway. Overexpression experiments demonstrated that cet-1 function requires wild-type sma genes. Interestingly, CET-1 appears to affect body length in a dose-dependent manner. Heterozygotes for cet-1 displayed body lengths ranging between null mutant and wild type, and overexpression of CET-1 in wild-type worms elongated body length close to lon mutants. In male sensory ray patterning, lack of cet-1 function results in ray fusions. Epistasis analysis revealed that mab-21 lies downstream and is negatively regulated by the cet-1/sma pathway in the male tail. Our results show that cet-1 controls diverse biological processes during C. elegans development probably through different target genes.

9847238|a|We cloned the dbl-1 gene, a C. elegans homolog of Drosophila decapentaplegic and vertebrate BMP genes. Loss-of-function mutations in dbl-1 cause markedly reduced body size and defective male copulatory structures. Conversely, dbl-1 overexpression causes markedly increased body size and partly complementary male tail phenotypes, indicating that DBL-1 acts as a dose-dependent regulator of these processes. Evidence from genetic interactions indicates that these effects are mediated by a Smad signaling pathway, for which DBL-1 is a previously unidentified ligand. Our study of the dbl-1 expression pattern suggests a role for neuronal cells in global size regulation as well as male tail patterning.

1425340|a|The mesoderm of amphibian embryos such as Xenopus laevis arises through an inductive interaction in which cells of the vegetal hemisphere of the embryo act on overlying equatorial and animal pole cells. Three classes of 'mesoderm-inducing factor' (MIF) that might be responsible for this interaction in vivo have been discovered. These are members of the transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-beta), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Wnt families. Among the most potent MIFs are the activins, members of the TGF-beta family, but RNA for activin A and B is not detectable in the Xenopus embryo until neurula and late blastula stages, respectively, and this is probably too late for the molecules to act as natural inducers. In this paper, we use the polymerase chain reaction to clone additional members of the TGF-beta family that might possess mesoderm-inducing activity. We show that transcripts encoding Xenopus bone morphogenetic protein 4 (XBMP-4) are detectable in the unfertilized egg, and that injection of XBMP-4 RNA into the animal hemisphere of Xenopus eggs causes animal caps isolated from the resulting blastulae to express mesoderm-specific markers. Surprisingly, however, XBMP-4 preferentially induces ventral mesoderm, whereas the closely related activin induces axial tissues. Furthermore, the action of XBMP-4 is 'dominant' over that of activin. In this respect, XBMP-4 differs from basic FGF, another ventral inducer, where simultaneous treatment with FGF and activin results in activin-like responses. The dominance of XBMP-4 over activin may account for the ability of injected XBMP-4 RNA to 'ventralize' whole Xenopus embryos. It is interesting, however, that blastopore formation in such embryos can occur perfectly normally. This contrasts with embryos ventralized by UV-irradiation and suggests that XBMP-4-induced ventralization occurs after the onset of gastrulation.

Targeting of both chordin Xenopus laevis pseudoalleles with morpholino antisense oligomers (Chd-MO) markedly decreased Chordin production. Embryos developed with moderately reduced dorsoanterior structures and expanded ventroposterior tissues, phenocopying the zebrafish chordino mutant. A strong requirement for Chordin in dorsal development was revealed by experimental manipulations. First, dorsalization by lithium chloride treatment was completely blocked by Chd-MO. Second, Chd-MO inhibited elongation and muscle differentiation in Activin-treated animal caps. Third, Chd-MO completely blocked the induction of the central nervous system (CNS), somites, and notochord by organizer tissue transplanted to the ventral side of host embryos. Unexpectedly, transplantations into the dorsal side revealed a cell-autonomous requirement of Chordin for neural plate differentiation.

7937936|a|Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which are members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, have been implicated in bone formation and the regulation of early development. To better understand the roles of BMPs in Xenopus laevis embryogenesis, we have cloned a cDNA coding for a serine/threonine kinase receptor that binds BMP-2 and BMP-4. To analyze its function, we attempted to block the BMP signaling pathway in Xenopus embryos by using a dominant-negative mutant of the BMP receptor. When the mutant receptor lacking the putative serine/threonine kinase domain was expressed in ventral blastomeres of Xenopus embryos, these blastomeres were respecified to dorsal mesoderm, eventually resulting in the formation of a secondary body axis. These findings suggest that endogenous BMP-2 and BMP-4 are involved in the dorsal-ventral specification in the embryo and that ventral fate requires induction rather than resulting from an absence of dorsal specification.

7630399|a|In Drosophila the amount of neurogenic ectoderm, from which the central nervous system (CNS) derives, is regulated by a dorsal-ventral system of positional information in which two secreted molecules of antagonistic functions, decapentaplegic (dpp) and short-gastrulation (sog), play fundamental roles. The vertebrate homologue of dpp is either bmp-4 or bmp-2 (ref. 5), and the homologue os sog is chd (s-chordin). In Xenopus the CNS is induced by signals emanating from the organizer, and two proteins secreted by the organizer, noggin and follistatin, have been shown to induce neural tissue in animal-cap assays. Here we report that Chd, another organizer-specific secreted factor, has neuralizing activity and that this activity can be antagonized by Bmp-4. Inhibition of the function of the endogenous Bmp-4 present in the animal cap also leads to neural differentiation. We suggest that conserved molecular mechanisms involving chd/sog and bmp-4/dpp gene products pattern the ectoderm in Xenopus and in Drosophila.

3282938|a|The body plan of Xenopus laevis can be respecified by briefly exposing early cleavage stage embryos to lithium. Such embryos develop exaggerated dorsoanterior structures such as a radial eye and cement gland (K.R. Kao, Y. Masui, and R.P. Elinson, 1986, Nature (London) 322, 371-373). In this paper, we demonstrate that the enhanced dorsoanterior phenotype results from an overcommitment of mesoderm to dorsoanterior mesoderm. Histological and immunohistochemical observations reveal that the embryos have a greatly enlarged notochord with very little muscle tissue. In addition, they develop a radial, beating heart, suggesting that lithium also specifies anterior mesoderm and pharyngeal endoderm. Randomly oriented diametrically opposed marginal zone grafts from lithium-treated embryos, when transplanted into ultraviolet (uv)-irradiated axis-deficient hosts, rescue dorsal axial structures. These transplantation experiments demonstrate that the entire marginal zone of the early gastrula consists of presumptive dorsal mesoderm. Vital dye marking experiments also indicate that the entire marginal zone maps to the prominent proboscis that is composed of chordamesoderm and represents the long axis of the embryo. These results suggest that lithium respecifies the mesoderm of Xenopus laevis embryos so that it differentiates into the Spemann organizer. We suggest that the origin of the dorsoanterior enhanced phenotypes generated by lithium and the dorsoanterior deficient phenotypes generated by uv irradiation are due to relative quantities of organizer. Our evidence demonstrates the existence of a continuum of body plan phenotypes based on this premise.

9774637|a|Hox proteins control developmental patterns and cell differentiation in vertebrates by acting as positive or negative regulators of still unidentified downstream target genes. The homeodomain and other small accessory sequences encode the DNA-protein and protein-protein interaction functions which ultimately dictate target recognition and functional specificity in vivo. The effector domains responsible for either positive or negative interactions with the cell transcriptional machinery are unknown for most Hox proteins, largely due to a lack of physiological targets on which to carry out functional analysis. We report the identification of the transcriptional activation domains of three human Hox proteins, HOXB1, HOXB3, and HOXD9, which interact in vivo with the autoregulatory and cross-regulatory enhancers of the murine Hoxb-1 and human HOXD9 genes. Activation domains have been defined both in a homologous context, i.e., within a HOX protein binding as a monomer or as a HOX-PBX heterodimer to the specific target, and in a heterologous context, after translocation to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Transfection analysis indicates that activation domains can be identified in different regions of the three HOX proteins depending on the context in which they interact with the DNA target. These results suggest that Hox proteins may be multifunctional transcriptional regulators, interacting with different cofactors and/or components of the transcriptional machinery depending on the structure of their target regulatory elements.

10199400|a|Following TGFbeta receptor-mediated phosphorylation and association with Smad4, Smad2 moves into the nucleus, binds to target promoters in association with DNA-binding cofactors, and recruits coactivators such as p300/CBP to activate transcription. We identified the homeodomain protein TGIF as a Smad2-binding protein and a repressor of transcription. A TGFbeta-activated Smad complex can recruit TGIF and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to a Smad target promoter, repressing transcription. Thus, upon entering the nucleus, a Smad2-Smad4 complex may interact with coactivators, forming a transcriptional activation complex, or with TGIF and HDACs, forming a transcriptional repressor complex.

12070091|a|The ventral region of the chick embryo optic cup undergoes a complex process of differentiation leading to the formation of four different structures: the neural retina, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the optic disk/optic stalk, and the pecten oculi. Signaling molecules such as retinoic acid and sonic hedgehog have been implicated in the regulation of these phenomena. We have now investigated whether the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) also regulate ventral optic cup development. Loss-of-function experiments were carried out in chick embryos in ovo, by intraocular overexpression of noggin, a protein that binds several BMPs and prevents their interactions with their cognate cell surface receptors. At optic vesicle stages of development, this treatment resulted in microphthalmia with concomitant disruption of the developing neural retina, RPE and lens. At optic cup stages, however, noggin overexpression caused colobomas, pecten agenesis, replacement of the ventral RPE by neuroepithelium-like tissue, and ectopic expression of optic stalk markers in the region of the ventral retina and RPE. This was frequently accompanied by abnormal growth of ganglion cell axons, which failed to enter the optic nerve. The data suggest that endogenous BMPs have significant effects on the development of ventral optic cup structures.

12112877|a|We have examined the roles of BMP4, Shh, and retinoic acid in establishing the proximal-distal and dorsal-ventral axes in the developing Xenopus eye. Misexpression of BMP4 caused the absence of an optic stalk and the expansion of dorsal and distal markers, tbx2/3/5, and pax6, at the expense of ventral and proximal markers vax2 and pax2. When Shh or Noggin, an antagonist of BMPs, was misexpressed, the reverse expression patterns of these marker genes were observed. These results suggest that BMP4 is involved in the specification of not only dorsal in the optic cup but also distal in the optic vesicle. Because Shh did not suppress bmp4 expression, unlike Noggin, Shh and BMP4 may antagonistically regulate common downstream genes in developing eye. We also found the difference between the effects of Shh and retinoic acid, another possible ventralizing factor, suggesting that Shh could promote ventralization independently of retinoic acid. These findings provide important clues to the coordinate and antagonistic actions of BMP4, Shh, and retinoic acid in axes specifications of Xenopus eyes.

12874124|a|The dorsal midline of the neural tube has recently emerged as a major signaling center for dorsoventral patterning. Msx genes are expressed at the dorsal midline, although their function at this site remains unknown. Using Msx1(nlacZ) mutant mice, we show that the normal expression domain of Msx1 is interrupted in the pretectum of mutant embryos. Morphological and gene expression data further indicate that a functional midline is not maintained along the whole prosomere 1 in Msx1 mutant mice. This results in the downregulation of genes expressed laterally to the midline in prosomere 1, confirming the importance of the midline as a signaling center. Wnt1 is essential for dorsoventral patterning of the neural tube. In the Msx1 mutant, Wnt1 is downregulated before the midline disappears, suggesting that its expression depends on Msx1. Furthermore, electroporation in the chick embryo demonstrates that Msx1 can induce Wnt1 expression in the diencephalon neuroepithelium and in the lateral ectoderm. In double Msx1/Msx2 mutants, Wnt1 expression is completely abolished at the dorsal midline of the diencephalon and rostral mesencephalon. This indicates that Msx genes may regulate Wnt1 expression at the dorsal midline of the neural tube. Based on these results, we propose a model in which Msx genes are intermediary between Bmp and Wnt at this site.

12498780|a|Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth differentiation factors (GDFs) are potential therapeutic molecules for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PO). Here we compare the effects of BMP3, 5, 6, and 7 and GDF5 and 6 in a rat mesencephalic cell culture system that reflects the developmental stage of neurons around birth. High concentrations of BMP5, 6, and 7 and GDF5 and 6 induced astroglial cell fate and a depletion of oligodendrocytes. Only BMP5, 6, and 7, however, significantly increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons and induced nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated BMP-restricted Smad in a substantial number of TH- and microtubule-associated protein 2(MAP2ab)-positive cells. None of the proteins protected TH-positive cells against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced oxidative stress. BMP3 was without any effect throughout the studies. We conclude that BMP5, 6, and 7 act directly and independently on precursors of the dopaminergic and astroglial lineage and induce their differentiation. In contrast, GDF5 and 6 primarily affect nonneuronal cells in mesencephalic cultures of this stage.

10448218|a|Cerebellar granule neurons, the most abundant class of CNS neurons, have a critical role in cerebellar function. Granule neurons are generated at the dorsal border of the mesencephalon and metencephalon, the rhombic lip. In the mouse embryo, rhombic lip cells express a number of granule neuron markers, notably the bHLH transcription factor Math1. Dorsal midline cells adjacent to the rhombic lip express Bmp6, Bmp7 and Gdf7, three genes encoding peptide growth factors of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family. These BMPs induced the expression of granule neuron markers in cultured neural tissue. Moreover, BMP-treated neural cells formed mature granule neurons after transplantation into the early postnatal cerebellum, suggesting that BMPs initiate the program of granule cell specification.

9748228|a|BMP7 and activin are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Here we characterize endogenous activin and BMP7 signaling pathways in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. We show that BMP7 and activin bind to the same type II receptors, ActRII and IIB, but recruit distinct type I receptors into heteromeric receptor complexes. The major BMP7 type I receptor observed was ALK2, while activin bound exclusively to ALK4 (ActRIB). BMP7 and activin elicited distinct biological responses and activated different Smad pathways. BMP7 stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous Smad1 and 5, formation of complexes with Smad4 and induced the promoter for the homeobox gene, Tlx2. In contrast, activin induced phosphorylation of Smad2, association with Smad4, and induction of the activin response element from the Xenopus Mix.2 gene. Biochemical analysis revealed that constitutively active ALK2 associated with and phosphorylated Smad1 on the COOH-terminal SSXS motif, and also regulated Smad5 and Smad8 phosphorylation. Activated ALK2 also induced the Tlx2 promoter in the absence of BMP7. Furthermore, we show that ALK1 (TSRI), an orphan receptor that is closely related to ALK2 also mediates Smad1 signaling. Thus, ALK1 and ALK2 induce Smad1-dependent pathways and ALK2 functions to mediate BMP7 but not activin signaling.

9335341|a|Distinct neuronal cell types are generated at characteristic times and positions in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We provide evidence that the identity and pattern of generation of dorsal neurons depend initially on BMP-mediated signals that derive from the epidermal ectoderm and induce dorsal midline cells of the roof plate. Roof plate cells provide a secondary source of TGFbeta-related signals that are required for the generation of distinct classes of dorsal interneurons. These inductive interactions involve both qualitative and quantitative differences in signaling by TGFbeta-related factors and temporal changes in the response of neural progenitor cells.

10683174|a|We have studied the role of Bmp signaling in patterning neural tissue through the use of mutants in the zebrafish that disrupt three different components of a Bmp signaling pathway: swirl/bmp2b, snailhouse/bmp7 and somitabun/smad5. We demonstrate that Bmp signaling is essential for the establishment of the prospective neural crest and dorsal sensory Rohon-Beard neurons of the spinal cord. Moreover, Bmp signaling is necessary to limit the number of intermediate-positioned lim1+ interneurons of the spinal cord, as observed by the dramatic expansion of these prospective interneurons in many mutant embryos. Our analysis also suggests a positive role for Bmp signaling in the specification of these interneurons, which is independent of Bmp2b/Swirl activity. We found that a presumptive ventral signal, Hh signaling, acts to restrict the amount of dorsal sensory neurons and trunk neural crest. This restriction appears to occur very early in neural tissue development, likely prior to notochord or floor plate formation. A similar early role for Bmp signaling is suggested in the specification of dorsal neural cell types, since the bmp2b/swirl and bmp7/snailhouse genes are only coexpressed during gastrulation and within the tail bud, and are not found in the dorsal neural tube or overlying epidermal ectoderm. Thus, a gastrula Bmp2b/Swirl and Bmp7/Snailhouse-dependent activity gradient may not only act in the specification of the embryonic dorsoventral axis, but may also function in establishing dorsal and intermediate neuronal cell types of the spinal cord.

14973289|a|Patterning of the dorsal neural tube involves Bmp signaling, which results in activation of multiple pathways leading to the formation of neural crest, roof plate and dorsal interneuron cell types. We show that constitutive activation of Bmp signaling at early stages (HH10-12) of chick neural tube development induces roof-plate cell fate, accompanied by an increase of programmed cell death and a repression of neuronal differentiation. These activities are mimicked by the overexpression of the homeodomain transcription factor Msx1, a factor known to be induced by Bmp signaling. By contrast, the closely related factor, Msx3, does not have these activities. At later stages of neural tube development (HH14-16), dorsal progenitor cells lose their competence to generate roof-plate cells in response to Bmp signaling and instead generate dorsal interneurons. This aspect of Bmp signaling is phenocopied by the overexpression of Msx3 but not Msx1. Taken together, these results suggest that these two different Msx family members can mediate distinct aspects of Bmp signaling during neural tube development.

9197246|a|The interplay between growth factors and transcription factors in vertebrate neurogenesis is poorly understood. MASH1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that is essential for autonomic neurogenesis. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2, and its relative BMP4, have been shown to induce expression of MASH1 and to promote autonomic neuronal differentiation in neural crest stem cells. The relationship between expression of MASH1 and the neurogenic competence of neural crest cells has not been investigated, however.We have examined the function of MASH1 in neurogenic competence using a population of immuno-isolated neural-crest-derived progenitor cells. Post-migratory neural crest cells isolated from fetal rat gut expressed Mash1, yet comprised a mixture of committed neuronal precursors and non-neuronal cells. The non-neuronal cells remained competent to differentiate to neurons, however, if challenged with BMP2. Such competence declines with time and is paralleled by a decline in Mash1 expression in the cells. Expression of endogenous Mash1 can be maintained by BMP2; in turn, constitutive expression of Mash1 from a retroviral vector maintains competence for neuronal differentiation in response to late addition of BMP2.These data suggest that MASH1 promotes competence for neurogenesis, in a manner similar to its homologs, the proneural genes achaete-scute in Drosophila. They also reveal an unexpected feedback interaction between BMP2 and MASH1 during neuronal differentiation. MASH1 may play multiple roles at successive stages of development within a neurogenic lineage, only one of which is revealed by a loss-of-function mutation.

7926763|a|Transcription of human HOX gene promoters in cultured cells is positively and negatively regulated by HOX proteins interacting with specific target sequences. The human HOXD9 protein activates transcription of the HOXD9 promoter by interacting with the HCR sequence and is antagonized by the HOXD8 protein. HOXD8 is not intrinsically a repressor, since it can activate transcription on different targets. Complete or partial HOXD8/HOXD9 homeo domain swapping indicates that the ability to recognize, and activate transcription from, the HCR target in vivo depends on the amino terminus and helix 1 of the homeo domain. The inhibitory activity of HOXD8 is not affected by deletion of the homeo domain helix 2/3 region, whereas it requires the amino terminus/helix 1 region and an additional, effector domain located at the protein amino-terminal end. This activity is therefore DNA-binding independent, and possibly mediated by protein-protein interactions. Affinity chromatography experiments show that the homeo domain amino terminus/helix 1 region is able to mediate direct interactions between HOX proteins in solution. These data indicate that specificity of HOX protein function in vivo depends on both DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions, mediated by the same sub region of the homeo domain.

596496|a|"Children Can't Fly" is a health education program developed by the New York City Department of Health to combat the high incidence of child mortality and morbidity due to falls from windows. The success of the program, begun in 1972, in drastically reducing death and injury persuaded the New York City Board of Health to amend the Health Code in 1976 to require that landlords provide window guards in apartments where children ten years old and younger reside. The law is the first and only one of its kind in the nation. The program has four major components: 1) reporting of falls by hospital emergency rooms and police precincts, followed up by counseling, referral, and data collecting by public health nurses; 2) a media campaign to inform the public and elevate their awareness of the hazards; 3) community education for prevention through door-to-door hazard identification, counseling by outreach workers, community organization efforts with schools, tenant groups, clinics, churches, health care providers, etc; 4) provision of free, easily installed window guards to families with young children living in high-risk areas. Significant reduction in falls resulted, particularly in the Bronx, where reported falls declined 50 percent from 1973 to 1975. The program is one solution to an urgent urban problem which other cities might consider to avert the loss of life and limb, and the corollary financial burden for hospitalization, rehabilitation, and maintenance of the injured and permanently disabled.

We describe the epidemiology of window falls from residential homes among pediatric patients at a suburban Level I trauma center.A review of patients admitted from January 1991 through November 1999 to a center serving a rapidly growing suburban area was performed.A total of 2,322 children, ages 0-14 years, were admitted during the study period. Falls comprised 41% of these admissions, and 11% of falls were from windows, greater than twice the national average. More than 39% of children who fell from windows were admitted directly to the intensive care unit. Overall mortality rate was 4%. Ages 0 to 4 years comprised the largest percentage (83%), and all children who died were in this age group. Children < or = 4 years were more likely to have an Abbreviated Injury Score > or = 2 (head injury) than those ages 10 to 14 years (p = 0.032). More than 31% of all children injured in window falls seen at the study institution between 1991 and 1999 were admitted in the last 2 years.Pediatric falls from windows in this suburban area appear to be increasing, with an incidence greater than the national average. Children at greatest risk are less than 4 years old. Further research in injury prevention at the national level aimed at suburban areas may be warranted.

14693898|a|Falls from balconies and windows are an important cause of childhood injury. This study investigated the circumstances around such falls and attempted to identify possible measures for their prevention.Children <15 years living in Dallas County, Texas.Each child treated because of a fall from a building in 1997-99 had information about the injury collected, and a parent was contacted to obtain further information. For apartment related falls, an attempt was made to visit the apartment to measure windows and balcony rails.Ninety eight children were injured in falls from buildings during the three year period; 39 (40%) were admitted to hospital. Seventy five of the falls (77%) involved apartments, and most occurred around noon or evening meal times. Among apartment falls, 39 (52%) fell from windows, 34 (45%) from balconies, and two (3%) from unknown sites. For more than two thirds of balcony related falls, the child fell from between the balcony rails, all of which were spaced more than 4 inches (10 cm) apart. On-site measurement showed the rails were an average of 7.5 inches (19 cm) apart; all of these apartments were built before 1984. For more than two thirds of window related falls, the window was situated within 2 feet (61 cm) of the floor.Two factors are important in falls from apartment windows and balconies: balcony rails more than 4 inches (10 cm) apart, and windows positioned low to the floor. Current building codes do not apply to older apartments, where most of these falls occurred. Nevertheless, these factors may be amenable to environmental modifications that may prevent most of these falls.

8516056|a|Falls from windows and balconies have long been recognized as a health hazard facing children in large, eastern cities. No study has explored this problem in western and sunbelt states.A retrospective chart review of children admitted to a large, west coast hospital for injuries sustained secondary to a fall from a building was conducted. The health care costs for injuries secondary to falls were estimated by reviewing Los Angeles County hospital discharge data over a 3-year period. Representative cities in western and sunbelt states were surveyed about their building code regulations for windows and balconies.Ninety-three children fell from windows and 58 from other structures (balconies, fire escapes, and roofs). The fall victims were more likely to be male (male-female ratio, 1.6:1), younger than 3 years old, and playing at the time of the fall. In more than 70% of the cases reviewed, the child fell from a second-story window. Morbidity was significant, with two thirds of children experiencing at least one fracture and more than 30% of the children requiring the intensive care unit. The mortality rate was low (0.7%); however, 10% were left neurologically impaired. The cost for hospitalization was approximately $5000 to $8000 per child. The survey revealed a lack of building code regulations for windows or window guards in western and sunbelt states.Falls from windows are a significant problem for children, not only in eastern cities, but throughout the nation. Morbidity is significant, even from less than three stories, and the health care cost is high. Preventive strategies are suboptimal.

9346088|a|To determine the frequency and geographical distribution of children falling from a height in London and to suggest possible causes and preventative measures.All relevant cases attended by the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) in a three and a half year period were reviewed and the locations related to the boroughs. The rates, per 1,000 resident children, were compared with socioeconomic indices for the boroughs concerned. In addition, a survey was undertaken of window fittings and maintenance in high rise flats close to one particular incident.A total of 90 incidents were attended involving 91 patients (64 male, 27 female) of whom five died. HEMS attends approximately one third of incidents involving serious trauma. In the study period the maximum frequency was 0.2 fallers per 1,000 resident children, occurring in three boroughs. In three boroughs there were no fallers. There was no overlap in socioeconomic indices between the five boroughs with the highest fall rates and the five with the lowest. The building survey found a high incidence of faulty window catches, a slow response rate for repair, and a lack of safety advice for residents.The frequency of falling is related to urban deprivation, poor maintenance, and lack of safety information. A combination of regulation and targeted education could substantially decrease deaths and injuries in children from this cause.

3383375|a|Excitation in the epicardial border zone of 3-5-day-old canine infarcts was mapped with an array of 192 bipolar electrodes during sustained ventricular tachycardia. Reentrant circuits were found in which activation occurred around long lines of apparent conduction block based on the criterion that excitation on opposite sides of the lines occurred with marked disparity in time. When the lines of apparent block were functional (i.e., occurred only during tachycardia and not during sinus rhythm or ventricular pacing) they were oriented parallel to the long axis of epicardial muscle fiber bundles. Isochrones distal to the lines were oriented parallel to them because widely separate sites within these isochrones were activated nearly simultaneously. This suggested that excitation not only occurred around the lines of block but also slowly across them. This slow activation occurred transverse to the long axis of the myocardial fibers and therefore might result because of the anisotropic tissue properties. To test this hypothesis, the epicardial border zone was stimulated during sinus rhythm through electrodes around its margin and at the center of the recording array. Activation transverse to the myocardial fibers in regions where lines of block occurred during tachycardia was slow, whereas it was rapid parallel to fibers' orientation. During tachycardia electrograms along the lines of apparent block had long durations and were fractionated, a characteristic that can also result from activation transverse to the myocardial fiber long axis. Therefore, we propose that the parallel orientation of the muscle bundles in the epicardial border zone is an important cause of ventricular tachycardia because activation transverse to myocardial fibers is sufficiently slow to permit the occurrence of reentry.

9201034|a|Previously, we have shown abnormalities in Vmax and in the recovery of Vmax in myocytes dispersed from the epicardial border zone (EBZ) of the 5-day infarcted canine heart (myocytes from the EBZ [IZs]). Thus, we sought to determine the characteristics of the whole-cell Na+ current (INa) in IsZs and compare them with the INa of cells from noninfarcted hearts (myocytes from noninfarcted epicardium [NZs]). INa was recorded using patch-clamp techniques under conditions that eliminated contaminating currents and controlled INa for measurement (19 degrees C, 5 mmol/L [Na+]zero). Peak INa density (at -25 mV) was significantly reduced in IZs (4.9 +/- 0.44 pA/pF, n = 36) versus NZs (12.8 +/- 0.55 pA/pF, n = 54; P < .001), yet the half-maximal activation voltage (V0.5), time course of decay, and time to peak INa were no different. However, in IZs, V0.5 of the availability curve (I/Imax curve) was shifted significantly in the hyperpolarizing direction (-80.2 +/- 0.48 mV in NZs [n = 45] versus -83.9 +/- 0.59 mV in IZs [n = 27], P < .01). Inactivation of INa directly from a depolarized prepotential (-60 mV) was significantly accelerated in IZs versus NZs (fast and slow time constants [T1 and T2, respectively] were as follows: NZs [n = 28], T1 = 71.5 +/- 5.6 ms and T2 = 243.7 +/- 17.1 ms; IZs [n = 21], T1 = 36.3 +/- 2.4 ms and T2 = 153 +/- 11.3 ms; P < .001). Recovery of INa from inactivation was dependent on the holding potential (VH) in both cell types but was significantly slower in IZs. At (VH) = -90 mV, INa recovery had a lag in 18 (82%) of 22 IZs (with a 17.6 +/- 1.5-ms lag) versus 2 (9%) of 22 NZs (with 5.9- and 8.7-ms lags); at VH = -100 mV, T1 = 60.9 +/- 2.6 ms and T2 = 352.8 +/- 28.1 ms in NZs (n = 41) versus T1 = 76.3 +/- 4.8 ms and T2 = 464.4 +/- 47.2 ms in IZs (n = 26) (P < .002 and P < .03, respectively); at VH = -110 mV, T1 = 33.4 +/- 1.8 ms and T2 = 293.5 +/- 33.6 ms in NZs (n = 21) versus T1 = 44.3 +/- 2.9 ms and T2 = 388.4 +/- 38 ms in IZs (n = 18) (P < .002 and P < .07, respectively). In sum, INa is reduced, and its kinetics are altered in IZs. These changes may underlie the altered excitability and postrepolarization refractoriness of the ventricular fibers of the EBZ, thus contributing to reentrant arrhythmias in the infarcted heart.

7586231|a|Ventricular arrhythmias frequently occur in patients suffering from ischemic heart disease. In a canine model developed to understand the pathoelectrophysiological mechanisms of the ischemia-related arrhythmias, electrical stimulation can initiate and terminate reentrant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, which arise in surviving subepicardial muscle fibers (epicardial border zone [EBZ] fibers) of the left ventricle 5 days after coronary artery occlusion. Both the structural and electrical changes occurring in the EBZ provide the important substrate for generation of reentrant ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that abnormalities exist in the electrophysiological properties of macroscopic Ca2+ currents in myocytes isolated from the EBZ of the 5-day infarcted canine heart (IZs). We recorded the T-type (ICa,T) and L-type (ICa,L) Ca2+ currents by using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique with either Ca2+ or Ba2+ (5 mmol/L) as the charge carrier and under experimental conditions (Na(+)- and K(+)-free solutions, 10 mmol/L intracellular EGTA) that eliminated contamination by other currents. When Ca2+ served as the charge carrier, the density of peak ICa,T in IZs (0.89 +/- 0.5 pA/pF, n = 28) was similar to that in myocytes from normal noninfarcted hearts (NZs) (1.1 +/- 0.5 pA/pF, n = 32). Although no changes existed in the properties of ICa,T, dramatic changes occurred in the density and function of ICa.L in IZs compared with NZs. Density of peak ICa,L at a holding potential of -40 mV (8-second clamp-step interval) was significantly reduced in IZs (4.6 +/- 1.5 pA/pF, n = 40) compared with NZs (7.2 +/- 1.6 pA/pF, n = 53). The reduction in peak ICa,L density was not attributable to altered steady state inactivation relations or a delay in recovery of ICa,L from inactivation. The time course of decay of peak ICa,: was described by a biexponential function in both cell types, with the fast and slow time constants (tau 1 and tau 2, respectively) of decay being significantly faster in IZs (tau 1 12.3 +/- 3.6 ms; tau 2, 55.1 +/- 31.1 ms) than in NZs (tau 1, 16.1 +/- 4.1 ms; tau 2, 85.2 +/- 51.7 ms). In addition, rapid clamp stimulation (at 1-s intervals) of cells produced a larger frequency-dependent decrease of peak ICa,L density in IZs than NZs, suggesting that at more physiologically relevant rates, little ICA.L may be activated. Finally, a significant reduction and acceleration of decay of the ICa,L persisted even when Ca2+ was substituted by equimolar Ba2+ as the charge carrier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

11033106|a|The rapid (I(Kr)) and slow (I(Ks)) components of delayed rectifier currents play an important role in determining the cardiac action potential configuration. Abnormalities in their function may contribute to arrhythmogenesis under pathological conditions. We studied the effects of myocardial infarction on I(Kr) and I(Ks) in canine ventricular myocytes and their molecular basis.Infarct zone myocytes (IZs) were isolated from a thin layer of surviving epicardium overlying an infarct 5 days after a total occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Normal myocytes (NZs) were isolated from the corresponding region of control hearts for comparison. Currents were recorded under the whole-cell patch clamp conditions.Both I(Kr) and I(Ks) current densities were reduced in IZs versus NZs. Kinetic analysis further suggests an acceleration of I(Kr) activation and I(Ks) deactivation. RNase protection assays were used to quantify the mRNA levels of I(Kr) and I(Ks) channel subunits (dERG, dIsK and dKvLQT1) in tissue immediately adjacent to the region where myocytes were isolated. mRNA levels of all three subunits were reduced 2 days after LAD occlusion (by 48+/-9%, 68+/-5%, and 45+/-4% for dERG, dIsK and dKvLQT1, respectively, n=8 each). By day 5, the dKvLQT1 message returned to control while those of dERG and dIsK remained reduced (by 52+/-7% and 76+/-6%, respectively).The decrease in I(Kr) and I(Ks) amplitudes and changes in their kinetics in infarcted tissue might be due to a decrease in functional channels and/or changes in their subunit composition. Heterogeneous changes in I(Kr) and I(Ks) in infarcted hearts may impact on the effects of varying heart rate or neurohumoral modulation on repolarization.

1371431|a|Reentrant ventricular arrhythmias can occur in the surviving muscle fibers of the epicardial border zone of the canine heart 5 days after coronary artery occlusion. To understand the cellular basis of these arrhythmias, we developed a method of dispersing myocytes (IZs) from the epicardial border zone.We compared the electrophysiological properties of IZs with those of cells dispersed from the epicardium of control noninfarcted (NZs) and of sham-operated animals (NZsham). Transmembrane action potentials of IZs are reduced in total action potential amplitude and maximum upstroke velocity compared with NZs. However, resting potential of IZs is no different from that of NZs. Action potential duration at -10 mV is significantly reduced in IZs compared with control, and IZ potentials do not show the typical "spike and dome" morphology that is evident in all NZs. Using Vmax as an indirect measure of the peak inward current available for the upstroke of the action potential, we found that the availability curve for IZs is significantly different from the NZ curve. Furthermore, the time course of recovery of Vmax after a depolarizing voltage clamp step was significantly altered in IZs. Using whole-cell voltage clamp techniques, we determined that the voltage-dependent, Ca(2+)-independent, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward current (ito1) occurred in all NZs (n = 16) but existed in only 37% of IZs (n = 16). There was a significant reduction in the density of ito1 elicited by depolarizing steps in those IZs showing ito1 compared with ito1 density in NZs.We have developed a single-cell model of cells that survive in the infarcted heart. Our studies indicate that there are changes in Vmax in IZs. In addition, there is no prominent phase 1 of repolarization in IZ action potentials. This is consistent with the dramatic loss in the function of the ionic channel responsible for the voltage-dependent transient outward current, ito1.

12388228|a|Heterogeneity of cardiac tissue is an important factor determining the initiation and dynamics of cardiac arrhythmias. In this paper, we studied the effects of gradients of electrophysiological heterogeneity on reentrant excitation patterns using computer simulations. We investigated the dynamics of spiral waves in a two-dimensional sheet of cardiac tissue described by the Luo-Rudy phase 1 (LR1) ventricular action potential model. A gradient of action potential duration (APD) was imposed by gradually varying the local current density of K(+) current or inward rectifying K(+) current along one axis of the tissue sheet. We show that a gradient of APD resulted in spiral wave drift. This drift consisted of two components. The longitudinal (along the gradient) component was always directed toward regions of longer spiral wave period. The transverse (perpendicular to the gradient) component had a direction dependent on the direction of rotation of the spiral wave. We estimated the velocity of the drift as a function of the magnitude of the gradient and discuss its implications.

12010915|a|K(ATP) channels, activated by ischemia, participate in the arrhythmogenic response to acute coronary occlusion. The function of these channels in border zones of healing infarcts, where arrhythmias also arise, has not been investigated. Do these channels remain maximally activated during infarct healing, or do they downregulate after a period of time? Both might preclude further activation.Myocardial infarction was produced in dogs by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Impulse propagation in the epicardial border zone (EBZ) of 4-day-old healing infarcts was mapped during administration of pinacidil, a K(ATP) channel activator, directly into the EBZ coronary blood supply. Pinacidil restored conduction and excitability when the EBZ was initially inexcitable and had large regions of block (6 of 8 experiments). This allowed reentrant circuits to form in the EBZ, causing tachycardia (4 of 8 experiments). In hearts with an initially excitable EBZ, pinacidil shortened the effective refractory period and abolished conduction block at short cycle lengths (7 experiments). This effect prevented initiation of reentry (1 of 2 experiments).The response to pinacidil indicates that K(ATP) channels in the EBZ remain functional and can be activated to influence electrophysiological properties and arrhythmogenesis.

9721700|a|Myocytes overlying a zone of infarction form the primary substrate for serious reentrant ventricular arrhythmias. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that antiarrhythmic agents affect Na+ channels of cells from the epicardial border zone (EBZ) of the 5-day infarcted heart differently than they affect those of normal muscle. However, the mechanisms responsible for this difference remain unclear. Previous studies have revealed differences in Na+ current (INa) density and inactivation gating kinetics in myocytes dispersed from the EBZ (IZs). Since changes in inactivation gating could influence lidocaine action, we examined the effects of lidocaine on INa of IZs (n=38) and epicardial myocytes from the noninfarcted heart (NZs) (n=50) using the whole-cell variation of the patch-clamp technique. In drug-free conditions, the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of IZs was shifted negative to that of NZs, causing greater inactivation of IZ channels at depolarized (> or = -100-mV) holding potentials. Consistent with a high affinity for the inactivated channel conformation, lidocaine produced more tonic block in IZs than NZs at depolarized holding potentials. Additionally, in drug-free conditions, IZ INa exhibited an enhanced rate of inactivation from closed states, a delay in recovery from inactivation, and increased use-dependent reduction in amplitude during rapid (1- to 3-Hz) pulse trains. In both IZs and NZs, lidocaine (20 to 120 micromol/L) accelerated the rate of time-dependent loss of availability and markedly delayed recovery from availability, inducing significant use-dependent reduction of INa. However, at drug concentrations > or =60 micromol/L, the difference in use-dependent current reduction between IZs and NZs was minimized. The action of lidocaine to render Na+ channel inactivation in NZs more similar to that of IZs may be central to its (pro)antiarrhythmic effects.

15485685|a|In this study, we investigated the effects of a PKA stimulating cocktail on sodium currents from normal epicardial cells (NZs) and on those from cells dispersed from the epicardial zone of the 5-day infarcted canine heart (IZs). To do so, we used whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques.During superfusion with the PKA activator cocktail, peak sodium current (I(Na)) density significantly increased by 32+/-5.3% (NZs) and 17+/-5.4% (IZs). However, despite this increase, IZ peak I(Na) still was not fully restored to NZ values. In both cell types, the density effect was accompanied by a shift in I/I(max) curves, as well as a slowing in recovery from inactivation. Inactivation from a closed state was accelerated. Furthermore, in the presence of chloroquine, which is known to interrupt intracellular vesicular traffic, PKA activator effects to augment I(Na) were only partially inhibited in NZs but abolished in IZs. To understand whether the phosphorylation status of basal Na(+) channels in the two cell groups differed, the effects of okadaic acid and PP2A1 were studied. Results suggest that in IZs, Na(+) channels in the basal state are already phosphorylated.PKA stimulation of I(Na) of the remodeled IZ does augment current density possibly by augmenting the trafficking of channels to an active site on the membrane. However, the resulting I(Na), while partially rescued, is not similar to the potentiated I(Na) of NZs. Specific kinetic changes also occur with the PKA stimulation of IZs and results with okadaic acid and PP2A1 suggest that in their remodeled state, Na(+) channels in IZs are already phosphorylated.

12388240|a|The density and kinetics of several ionic currents of cells isolated from the epicardial border zone of the infarcted heart (IZs) are markedly different from cells from the noninfarcted canine epicardium (NZs). To understand how these changes in channel function affect the action potential of the IZ cell as well as its response to antiarrhythmic agents, we developed a new ionic model of the action potential of a cell that survives in the infarct (IZ) and one of a normal epicardial cell (NZ) using formulations based on experimental measurements. The difference in action potential duration (APD) between NZ and IZ cells during steady-state stimulation (basic cycle length = 250 ms) was 6 ms (156 ms in NZ and 162 ms in IZ). However, because IZs exhibit postrepolarization refractoriness, the difference in the effective refractory period (ERP), calculated using a propagation model of a single fiber of 100 cells, was 43 ms (156 ms in NZ and 199 ms in IZ). Either an increase in L-type Ca(2+) current (to simulate the effects of BAY Y5959) or a decrease of both or either delayed rectifier currents (e.g., to simulate the effects of azimilide, sotalol, and chromanol) had significant effects on NZ ERP. In contrast, the effects of these agents in IZs were minor, in agreement with measurements in the in situ canine infarcted heart. Therefore 1) because IZs exhibit postrepolarization refractoriness, conclusions drawn from APD measurements cannot be extrapolated directly to ERPs; 2) ionic currents that are the major determinants of APD and the ERP in NZs are less important in IZs; and 3) differential effects of either BAY Y5959 or azimilide in NZs versus IZs are predicted to decrease ERP dispersion and in so doing prevent initiation of arrhythmias in a substrate of inhomogeneous APD/ERPs.

12600896|a|The epicardial border zone (EBZ) of canine infarcts has increased anisotropy because of transverse conduction slowing. It remains unknown whether changes in gap junctional conductance (Gj) accompany the increased anisotropy. Ventricular cell pairs were isolated from EBZ and normal hearts (NZ). Dual patch clamp was used to quantify Gj. At a transjunctional voltage (Vj) of +10 mV, side-to-side Gj of EBZ pairs (9.2+/-3.4 nS, n=16) was reduced compared with NZ side-to-side Gj (109.4+/-23.6 nS, n=14, P<0.001). Gj of end-to-end coupled cells was not reduced in EBZ. Steady-state Gj of both NZ and EBZ showed voltage dependence, described by a two-way Boltzmann function. Half-maximal activation voltage in EBZ was shifted to higher Vj in positive and negative directions. Immunoconfocal planimetry and quantification showed no change in connexin43 per unit cell volume or surface area in EBZ. Decreased side-to-side coupling occurs in EBZ myocytes, independent of reduced connexin43 expression, and is hypothesized to contribute to increased anisotropy and reentrant arrhythmias.

11891345|a|Voltage-gated sodium channels composed of pore-forming alpha and auxiliary beta subunits are responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in cardiac muscle, but the functional roles of distinct sodium channel subtypes have not been clearly defined. Immunocytochemical studies show that the principal cardiac pore-forming alpha subunit isoform Na(v)1.5 is preferentially localized in intercalated disks, whereas the brain alpha subunit isoforms Na(v)1.1, Na(v)1.3, and Na(v)1.6 are localized in the transverse tubules. Sodium currents due to the highly tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive brain isoforms in the transverse tubules are small and are detectable only after activation with beta scorpion toxin. Nevertheless, they play an important role in coupling depolarization of the cell surface membrane to contraction, because low TTX concentrations reduce left ventricular function. Our results suggest that the principal cardiac isoform in the intercalated disks is primarily responsible for action potential conduction between cells and reveal an unexpected role for brain sodium channel isoforms in the transverse tubules in coupling electrical excitation to contraction in cardiac muscle.

8718981|a|The pharmacologic responses of macroscopic L-type calcium channel currents to the dihydropyridine agonist, Bay K 8644, and beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation by isoproterenol were studied in myocytes enzymatically dissociated from the epicardial border zone of the arrhythmic 5-day infarcted canine heart (IZs). Calcium currents were recorded at 36 degrees to 37 degrees C using the whole cell, patch clamp method and elicited by applying step depolarizations from a holding potential of -40 mV to various test potentials for 250-msec duration at 8-second intervals. A Cs+ -rich and 10 mM EGTA-containing pipette solution and a Na+ -and K+ -free external solutions were used to isolate calcium currents from other contaminating currents. During control, peak ICa,L density was found to be significantly less in IZs (4.0 +/- 1.1 pA/pF) than in myocytes dispersed from the epicardium of the normal noninfarcted heart (NZs; 6.5 +/- 1.8 pA/pF). Bay K 8644 (1 micro M) significantly increased peak ICa,L density 3.5-fold above control levels in both NZs (to 22.5 +/- 6.2 pA/pF; n = 7) and IZs (to 12.8 +/- 3.0 pA/pF; n = 5), yet peak ICa,L density in the presence of drug was significantly less in IZs than NZs. The effects of Bay K 8644 on kinetics of current decay and steady-state inactivation relations of peak ICa,L were similar in the two cell types. In contrast, the response of peak L-type current density to isoproterenol (1 micro M) was significantly diminished in IZs compared to NZs regardless of whether Ba2+ or Ca2+ ions carried the current. Thus, these results indicate an altered responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation in cells that survive in the infarcted heart. Furthermore, application of forskolin (1 micro M and 10 micro M) or intracellular cAMP (200 micro M), agents known to act downstream of the beta-receptor, also produced a smaller increase in peak IBa density in IZs versus NZs, suggesting that multiple defects exist in the beta-adrenergic signaling pathway of IZs. In conclusion, these studies illustrate that reduced macroscopic calcium currents of cells in the infarcted heart exhibit an altered pharmacologic profile that has important implications in the development of drugs for the diseased heart.

15087289|a|Action potentials (APs) of the epicardial border zone (EBZ) cells from the day 5 infarcted heart continue to be altered by day 14 postocclusion, namely, they shortened. However, by 2 mo, EBZ APs appear "normal," yet conduction of wave fronts remains abnormal. We hypothesize that the changes in transmembrane APs are due to a change in the distribution of ion channels in either density or function. Thus we focused on the changes in Ca2+ and K+ currents in cells isolated from the 14-day (IZ14d) and 2-mo (IZ2m) EBZ and compared them with those occurring in cells from the same hearts but remote (Rem) from the EBZ. Whole cell voltage-clamp techniques were used to measure and compare Ca2+ and K+ currents in cells from the different groups. Ca2+ current densities remain reduced in cells of the 14-day and 2-mo infarcted heart and the kinetic changes previously identified in the 5-day heart begin to, but do not recover to, cells from noninfarcted epicardium (NZ) values. Importantly, I(Ca,L) in both the EBZ and Rem regions still show a slowed recovery from inactivation. Furthermore, during the remodeling process, there is an increased expression of T-type Ca2+ currents, but only regionally, and only within a specific time window postmyocardial infarction (MI). Regional heterogeneity in beta-adrenergic responsiveness of I(Ca,L) exists between EBZ and remote cells of the 14-day hearts, but this regional heterogeneity is gone in the healed infarcted heart. In IZ14d, the transient outward K+ current (Ito) begins to reemerge and is accompanied by an upregulated tetraethylammonium-sensitive outward current. By 2-mo postocclusion, Ito and sustained outward K+ current have completed the reverse remodeling process. During the healing process post-MI, canine epicardial cells downregulate the fast Ito but compensate by upregulating a K+ current that in normal cells is minimally functional. For recovering I(Ca,L) of the 14-day and 2-mo EBZ cells, voltage-dependent processes appear to be reset, such that I(Ca,L) "window" current occurs at hyperpolarized potentials. Thus dynamic changes in both Ca2+ and K+ currents contribute to the altered AP observed in 14-day fibers and may account for return of APs of 2 mo EBZ fibers.

9137211|a|Ventricular tachycardia late after myocardial infarction is usually due to reentry in the infarct region. These reentry circuits can be large, complex and difficult to define, impeding study in the electrophysiology laboratory and making catheter ablation difficult. Pacing through the electrodes of the mapping catheter provides a new approach to mapping. When pacing stimuli capture the effects on the tachycardia depend on the location of the pacing site relative to the reentry circuit. The effects observed allow identification of various portions of the reentry circuit, without the need for locating the entire circuit. Isthmuses where relatively small lesions produced by radiofrequency catheter ablation can interrupt reentry can often be identified. A classification that divides reentry circuits into one or more functional components helps to conceptualize the reentry circuit and predicts the likelihood that heating with radiofrequency current will terminate tachycardia. These methods are helping to define human reentry circuits.

9316533|a|We sought to determine whether endocardial late potentials during sinus rhythm are associated with reentry circuit sites during ventricular tachycardia (VT).During sinus rhythm, slow conduction through an old infarct region may depolarize tissue after the end of the QRS complex. Such slow conduction regions can cause reentry.Endocardial catheter mapping and radiofrequency ablation were performed in 24 patients with VT late after myocardial infarction. We selected for analysis a total of 103 sites where the electrogram was recorded during sinus rhythm and, without moving the catheter, VT was initiated and radiofrequency current applied in an attempt to terminate VT.Late potentials were present at 34 sites (33%). During pace mapping, the stimulus-QRS complex was longer at late potential sites, consistent with slow conduction, than at sites without late potentials (p < 0.0001). Late potentials were present at 15 (71%) of 21 sites classified as central or proximal in the reentry circuit based on entrainment, but also occurred frequently at bystander sites (13 [33%] of 39) and were often absent at the reentry circuit exit (3 [23%] of 13). Late potentials were present at 20 (54%) of 37 sites where ablation terminated VT, compared with 14 (21%) of 66 sites where ablation did not terminate VT (p = 0.004). Ablation decreased the amplitude of the late potentials present at sites where ablation terminated VT.Although sites with sinus rhythm late potentials often participate in VT reentry circuits, many reentry circuit sites do not have late potentials. Late potentials can also arise from bystander regions. Late potentials may help identify abnormal regions in sinus rhythm but cannot replace mapping during induced VT to guide ablation.

3342490|a|In this report we describe electrophysiologic and histologic findings in hearts and endocardially resected preparations from patients with sustained ventricular tachycardias in the chronic phase of myocardial infarction. We recorded simultaneously from 64 endocardial sites during tachycardia in 72 patients that were operated on for medically intractable ventricular tachycardias. Two other patients underwent heart transplantation, and mapping was performed on the explanted isolated heart connected to a Langendorff perfusion set-up. During operation 139 tachycardias with different morphologies could be induced. Although the majority of evidence supports the concept of a reentrant mechanism for these tachycardias, we found that 105 tachycardias appeared to arise at a focal area of less than 1.4 cm2. In only three cases macroreentry around the infarction scar could be detected. Of 21 tachycardias in which the "origin" appeared to be focal, earliest subendocardial activation was preceded by discrete electrograms of low amplitude (presystolic activity). In three tachycardias presystolic activity was detected at several sites, permitting reconstruction of its route. Histology of the endocardial resected preparation in one of these cases revealed separate zones of viable myocardial fibers in areas in which presystolic activity was recorded. These zones were located intramurally and subendocardially, supporting the concept that reentry occurred via isolated bundles of surviving myocytes at the border of the infarct and the larger subendocardial muscle mass. Conduction velocity through the isolated tracts was on the order of 25 cm/sec. Similar reentrant pathways were found in the two isolated hearts. Extracellular and intracellular recordings were made from 20 endocardial preparations that were excised from areas in which tachycardia originated. Preparations were superfused in a tissue bath. These experiments showed that action potentials were usually close to normal, but occasionally action potentials with reduced amplitude and slow upstrokes were found. In addition, there were cells that exhibited both fast and slow upstrokes, depending on the direction of the wavefront. Histology of seven resected preparations and the isolated hearts showed subendocardially as well as intramurally located zones of viable myocardium. Fractionation of extracellular electrograms and slow conduction were found in areas where surviving muscle fibers and strands of fibrous tissue were interwoven, and in zones where muscle fibers were oriented in parallel but isolated by strands of connective tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

3383375|a|Excitation in the epicardial border zone of 3-5-day-old canine infarcts was mapped with an array of 192 bipolar electrodes during sustained ventricular tachycardia. Reentrant circuits were found in which activation occurred around long lines of apparent conduction block based on the criterion that excitation on opposite sides of the lines occurred with marked disparity in time. When the lines of apparent block were functional (i.e., occurred only during tachycardia and not during sinus rhythm or ventricular pacing) they were oriented parallel to the long axis of epicardial muscle fiber bundles. Isochrones distal to the lines were oriented parallel to them because widely separate sites within these isochrones were activated nearly simultaneously. This suggested that excitation not only occurred around the lines of block but also slowly across them. This slow activation occurred transverse to the long axis of the myocardial fibers and therefore might result because of the anisotropic tissue properties. To test this hypothesis, the epicardial border zone was stimulated during sinus rhythm through electrodes around its margin and at the center of the recording array. Activation transverse to the myocardial fibers in regions where lines of block occurred during tachycardia was slow, whereas it was rapid parallel to fibers' orientation. During tachycardia electrograms along the lines of apparent block had long durations and were fractionated, a characteristic that can also result from activation transverse to the myocardial fiber long axis. Therefore, we propose that the parallel orientation of the muscle bundles in the epicardial border zone is an important cause of ventricular tachycardia because activation transverse to myocardial fibers is sufficiently slow to permit the occurrence of reentry.

11067798|a|We studied whether increasing L-type calcium current has antiarrhythmic effects.Reentrant circuits in the epicardial border zone (EBZ) of healing canine infarcts were mapped during sustained ventricular tachycardia. The cardiac-specific L-type calcium current enhancer Bay Y5959 prevented initiation of sustained ventricular tachycardia in 7 of 14 experiments. Bay Y5959 caused slowing of conduction in areas of slow nonuniform conduction in reentrant circuits; block eventually occurred. Conduction was not affected in other regions of the circuits or in more normal areas of the EBZ, nor was the EBZ effective refractory period changed. Bay Y5959 also improved conduction of premature impulses so that lines of unidirectional block necessary for VT initiation were not formed, an effect not related to a change in the effective refractory period at the site of block.Block of conduction caused by enhanced L-type calcium current in reentrant circuits may result from a decreased gap junctional conductance consequent to an increase in intracellular calcium. An increase in L-type calcium current may improve conduction of premature impulses.

2561792|a|1. Single sodium channel currents were recorded from canine ventricular myocytes in cell-attached patches. The relative rates of single-channel activation vs. inactivation as well as the voltage dependence of the rate of open-channel inactivation were studied. 2. Ensemble-averaged sodium currents showed relatively normal activation and inactivation kinetics, although the mid-point of the steady-state inactivation (h infinity) curve was shifted by 20-30 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction. This shift was due to the bath solution, which contained isotonic KCl to depolarize the cell to 0 mV. 3. Steady-state activation showed less of a voltage shift. The threshold for eliciting channel opening was around -70 mV and the mid-point of activation occurred near -50 mV. 4. The decline of the ensemble-averaged sodium current during a maintained depolarization was fitted by a single exponential function characterizing the apparent time constant of inactivation (tau h). The apparent rate of inactivation was voltage dependent, with tau h decreasing e-fold for a 15.4 mV depolarization. 5. The relative contributions of the rates of single-channel activation and inactivation in determining the time course of current decay (tau h) were examined using the approach of Aldrich, Corey & Stevens (1983). Mean channel open time (tau o) showed significant voltage dependence, increasing from 0.5 ms at -70 mV to around 0.8 ms at -40 mV. At -70 mV tau h was much greater than tau o, while at -40 mV the two time constants were similar. 6. The degree to which the kinetics of single-channel activation contribute to tau h was studied using the first latency distribution. The first latency function was fitted by two exponentials. The slow component was voltage dependent, decreasing from 19 ms at -70 mV to 0.5 ms at -40 mV. The fast component (0.1-0.5 ms) was not well resolved. 7. Comparing the first latency distribution with the time course of the ensemble-averaged sodium current at -40 mV showed that activation is nearly complete by the time of peak inward sodium current. However, at -70 mV, activation overlaps significantly with the apparent time course of inactivation of the ensemble-averaged current. 8. Using the methods of Aldrich et al. (1983) we also measured the apparent rate of open-channel closing (a) and open-channel inactivation (b). Both rates were voltage dependent, with a showing an e-fold decrease for an 11 mV depolarization and b showing an e-fold increase for a 30 mV depolarization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

12480819|a|It is well known that the sodium current (I(Na)) and the degree of gap-junctional electrical coupling are the key determinants of action potential (AP) conduction in cardiac tissue. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that sodium channels (NaChs) are preferentially located in intercalated disks (IDs). Using dual immunocytochemical staining, we confirmed the colocalization of NaChs with connexin43 in cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. In mathematical simulations of conduction using the Luo-Rudy dynamic model of the ventricular AP, we assessed the hypothesis that conduction could be modulated by the preferential localization of NaChs in IDs. Localization of I(Na) at the ID caused a large negative potential in the intercellular cleft, which influenced conduction in two opposing ways, depending on the degree of electrical coupling: (1) for normal and moderately reduced coupling, the negative cleft potential led to a large overshoot of the transmembrane potential resulting in a decreased driving force for I(Na) itself (self-attenuation), which slowed conduction; (2) for greatly reduced coupling (<10%), the negative cleft potential induced by I(Na) in the prejunctional membrane led to suprathreshold depolarization of the postjunctional membrane, which facilitated and accelerated conduction. When cleft potential effects were not incorporated, conduction was not significantly affected by the ID localization of I(Na). By enhancing conduction through the establishment of cleft potentials, the localization of NaChs in IDs might protect the myocardium from conduction block, very slow conduction, and microreentry under conditions of greatly reduced coupling. Conversely, by supporting moderately slow conduction, this mechanism could also promote arrhythmias.

9054762|a|Slow, nonuniform conduction caused by abnormal gap-junctional coupling of infarct-related myocardium is thought to be a component of the arrhythmogenic substrate. The hypothesis that changes in gap-junctional distribution in the epicardial border zone (EBZ) of healing canine infarcts define the locations of reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) circuits was tested by correlating activation maps of the surviving subepicardial myocardial layer with immunolocalization of the principal gap-junctional protein, connexin43 (Cx43).The EBZ overlying 4-day-old anterior infarcts in three dogs with inducible VT and three noninducible dogs was mapped with a high-resolution electrode array and systematically examined by standard histology and confocal immunolocalization of Cx43. The thickness of the EBZ was significantly less in the hearts with (538 +/- 257 microns) than without (840 +/- 132 microns; P < .05) VT. At the interface with the underlying necrotic cells, the EBZ myocardium showed a marked disruption of gap-junctional distribution, with Cx43 labeling abnormally arrayed longitudinally along the lateral surfaces of the cells. In the EBZ of all hearts, the disrupted Cx43 labeling extended part of the way to the epicardial surface, with the most superficial epicardial myocytes having the normal transversely orientated pattern. Only in the hearts with inducible VT did the disorganization extend through the full thickness of the surviving layer at sites correlating with the location of the central common pathways of the figure-of-8 reentrant VT circuits.Altered gap-junctional distribution is part of the early remodeling of myocardium after infarction, and by defining the location of the common central pathway of the reentrant VT circuits, it may be a determinant of VT susceptibility.

1619408|a|To characterise the pathogenetic and prognostic features of lacunar infarcts, 88 patients with these infarcts were compared with 103 patients with non-lacunar infarcts. Potential cardioembolic sources were significantly more frequent among patients with non-lacunar infarcts (p = 0.0025). Although the prevalence of hypertension was higher among lacunar infarcts, this difference was not statistically significant. However, the distribution of hypertensive patients in the two groups of lacunar and non-lacunar infarcts was influenced by the presence or absence of cardioembolic sources: hypertension was significantly associated with the presence of cardioembolic sources among non-lacunar infarcts, whereas among lacunar infarcts it was significantly more frequent in patients without a cardioembolic source. This indicates that cardioembolism may exert a confounding effect by suppressing the relation between hypertension and lacunar infarcts. In a mean follow up period of 28.1 months, lacunar infarcts had a significantly lower incidence of stroke recurrence and of myocardial infarction (age-adjusted survival analysis: p = 0.0008); mortality from all causes was also lower in patients with lacunar infarct (age-adjusted survival analysis: 0.04 less than p less than 0.05). In a multivariate regression analysis, stroke subtype was an independent predictor of new major vascular events. These findings support the lacunar hypothesis and should be considered in the planning of epidemiological and therapeutic studies in patients with cerebral infarction.

Serial sections of the involved basal ganglia were studied in ten infarcts and only a gross dissection was made in the other. The implicated penetrating arteries were traced throughout their length and obstructive vascular lesions were found in nine instances. In two of the nine there was an atheromatous plaque with a superimposed thrombus, in four an atheromatous plaque had caused severe stenosis, in one a destructive arterial process lipohyalinosis had occurred, in one case the nature of the obstruction remained "uncertained," and in one the penetrating arteries were obstructed at their orifices by an atheroma in the superior division of the middle cerebral artery. In two cases the vessels were patent, suggesting embolism. The atheromas consisted almost exclusively of a conglomerate of fat-filled macrophages. The clinical correlate was a pure motor hemiplegia or hemiparesis involving the face, arm, and leg without sensory deficit, homonymous hemianopia, receptive aphasia, or apractognosia. Confusion was prominent in one patient.

7048128|a|At least 20 different lacunar syndromes have been described and can be recognized by characteristic clinical features. Almost all occur in patients with hypertension. Small lacunes are usually due to lipohyalinosis, larger ones to atheromatous or embolic occlusion of a penetrating vessel. The concept of the "lacunar state" is examined in the light of recent knowledge with the conclusion that the clinical deficit is primarily related to unrecognized normal pressure hydrocephalus rather than to the presence of a few lacunes. The notion that lacunes occur haphazardly is criticized because the first or only lacune tends to be symptomatic. The incidence of cerebral lacunes has declined since the introduction of antihypertensive therapy, an indication that therapy is effective.

2309260|a|We tested the hypothesis that hypertension is more common and cardiac embolism less common in patients with lacunar infarction than in patients with other types of cerebral infarction. We studied risk factor profiles in a series of 102 consecutive patients with a lacunar infarct and 202 consecutive patients with a carotid artery-distribution infarct involving the cortex registered in the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project, a community-based study of first-ever stroke. The two groups did not differ in the prevalence of prestroke hypertension (defined in a number of ways) or in the prevalence of markers of sustained hypertension. The presence of atrial fibrillation and a history of myocardial infarction, particularly during the 6 weeks before the stroke, were significantly more common in the group with carotid-distribution infarcts involving the cortex. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of other accepted risk factors for ischemic stroke, including previous transient ischemic attack, cervical bruit, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, or cigarette smoking. Our results suggest that hypertension is no more important in the development of lacunar infarction than it is in the development of other types of ischemic stroke that are presumed to be due to atherosclerotic thromboembolism in a major cerebral artery. Our data support the autopsy evidence that cardioembolic occlusion is an unusual cause of lacunar infarction.

1750044|a|In this study, we investigated the lacunar hypothesis to answer three questions: 1) Is the lacunar syndrome valid for diagnosing lacunar infarction? 2) What is the frequency of potential cardiac versus carotid sources of embolism in patients with lacunar versus cortical infarct? 3) What is the frequency of vascular risk factors in these two groups of patients?The study was performed in a well-defined prospective series of 103 patients with a first-ever lacunar infarct and 144 other patients with a first-ever infarct involving the cortex.Sensitivity and specificity of the lacunar syndromes in diagnosing lacunar infarction were 95% and 93%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values of diagnosing lacunar infarction in patients with lacunar syndromes were 90% and 97%, respectively. Risk factor analysis showed no differences for either group of cerebral infarction. A cardiac source of embolism was significantly less frequent in patients with lacunar infarction (odds ratio = 0.32, 95% confidence interval = 0.17-0.61, p less than 0.001). Significant carotid stenosis (diameter reduction greater than or equal to 50%) was also less frequent in patients with lacunar infarction (odds ratio = 0.35, 95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.76, p less than 0.001).These findings show that the lacunar syndrome is an excellent clinical test for diagnosing lacunar infarction and that cardiac and carotid embolism are unlikely causes of lacunar infarction, supporting the hypothesis that lacunar infarcts are usually caused by small vessel disease.

1675378|a|We describe the incidence and natural history of four clinically identifiable subgroups of cerebral infarction in a community-based study of 675 patients with first-ever stroke. Of 543 patients with a cerebral infarct, 92 (17%) had large anterior circulation infarcts with both cortical and subcortical involvement (total anterior circulation infarcts, TACI); 185 (34%) had more restricted and predominantly cortical infarcts (partial anterior circulation infarcts, PACI); 129 (24%) had infarcts clearly associated with the vertebrobasilar arterial territory (posterior circulation infarcts, POCI); and 137 (25%) had infarcts confined to the territory of the deep perforating arteries (lacunar infarcts, LACI). There were striking differences in natural history between the groups. The TACI group had a negligible chance of good functional outcome and mortality was high. More than twice as many deaths were due to the complications of immobility than to direct neurological sequelae of the infarct. Patients in the PACI group were much more likely to have an early recurrent stroke than were patients in other groups. Those in the POCI group were at greater risk of a recurrent stroke later in the first year after the index event but had the best chance of a good functional outcome. Despite the small anatomical size of the infarcts in the LACI group, many patients remained substantially handicapped. The findings have important implications for the planning of stroke treatment trials and suggest that various therapies could be directed specifically at the subgroups.

7678184|a|The etiology of ischemic stroke affects prognosis, outcome, and management. Trials of therapies for patients with acute stroke should include measurements of responses as influenced by subtype of ischemic stroke. A system for categorization of subtypes of ischemic stroke mainly based on etiology has been developed for the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST).A classification of subtypes was prepared using clinical features and the results of ancillary diagnostic studies. "Possible" and "probable" diagnoses can be made based on the physician's certainty of diagnosis. The usefulness and interrater agreement of the classification were tested by two neurologists who had not participated in the writing of the criteria. The neurologists independently used the TOAST classification system in their bedside evaluation of 20 patients, first based only on clinical features and then after reviewing the results of diagnostic tests.The TOAST classification denotes five subtypes of ischemic stroke: 1) large-artery atherosclerosis, 2) cardioembolism, 3) small-vessel occlusion, 4) stroke of other determined etiology, and 5) stroke of undetermined etiology. Using this rating system, interphysician agreement was very high. The two physicians disagreed in only one patient. They were both able to reach a specific etiologic diagnosis in 11 patients, whereas the cause of stroke was not determined in nine.The TOAST stroke subtype classification system is easy to use and has good interobserver agreement. This system should allow investigators to report responses to treatment among important subgroups of patients with ischemic stroke. Clinical trials testing treatments for acute ischemic stroke should include similar methods to diagnose subtypes of stroke.

2298227|a|A prospective series of 60 consecutive patients with lacunar cerebral infarcts (LI), studied using nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) and brain computerized tomography (CT), is presented. A significantly greater number of positive results (p less than 0.001) was observed in the MR (78%) in comparison with the CT scan (30%). In pure motor hemiparesis, the number of positive results obtained with MR was maximal (85%) and greater than with CT scan (35%; p less than 0.001). In pure sensory stroke, the positivity was 40% in MR and 20% in CT. In pontine and capsular topography, MR showed a greater sensitivity than CT scan (p less than 0.001). A significantly (p less than 0.001 greater number of silent infarcts were detected by MR (42%) than by CT scan (18.5%). Nowadays, MR is the complementary examination of choice in the topographic diagnosis of LI and should be carried out whenever possible in all patients presenting with this pathology.

11039337|a|The importance of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for delineating acute ischemic lesions has been investigated extensively; however, few studies have investigated the role of DWI in the subacute stage of stroke. Because these lesions tend to appear bright throughout the first days of ischemia, owing to restricted diffusion, we speculated that DWI could also improve the detection of subacute infarcts as compared with conventional and contrast-enhanced MR imaging.Interleaved echo-planar DWI with phase navigation was performed on a 1.5-T MR unit in a consecutive series of 53 patients (mean age, 66 +/- 14 years) with suspected recent cerebral ischemia. The interval between onset of clinical symptoms and MR imaging ranged from 1 to 14 days (mean, 6 +/- 4 days). Contrast material was given to 28 patients in a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg.DWI clearly delineated recent ischemic damage in 39 patients (74%) as compared with 33 (62%) in whom lesions were identified or suspected on conventional T2-weighted images. DWI provided information not accessible with T2-weighted imaging in 17 patients when evidence of lesion multiplicity or detection of clinically unrelated recent lesions was included for comparison. Subacute ischemic lesions were also seen more frequently on DWI sequences than on contrast-enhanced images (20 versus 13 patients). DWI was more likely to make a diagnostic contribution in the first week of stroke and in patients with small lesions or preexisting ischemic cerebral damage than was conventional MR imaging.Recent ischemic damage is better shown on DWI sequences than on conventional and contrast-enhanced MR images throughout the first days after stroke and may provide further information about the origin of clinical symptoms. Adding DWI to imaging protocols for patients with subacute cerebral ischemia is recommended.

14693110|a|Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has already had a substantial effect on the diagnosis of patients with ischaemic stroke. It provides in vivo pathological information and allows the differentiation of acute stroke from chronic stroke and from non-specific white-matter lesions. The high contrast of the acute DWI lesion against the dark background facilitates the detection of lesions even when they are 1 mm or less in diameter. Small lesions, which are undetectable by other means, include small lacunar infarcts, punctate cortical infarcts, and DWI bright dots in patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA). The latter constitute remnants or "footprints" of recent ischaemia and confirm the clinical TIA syndrome as ischaemic. Because of these attributes, DWI not only confirms the clinical diagnosis, but also facilitates the recognition of certain patterns of ischaemia, thereby providing clues to the underlying aetiology. DWI is becoming an important technique for optimum management of patients.

10582991|a|Small infarcts in the territory of penetrator arteries were described as causing a number of distinct clinical syndromes. The vascular pathophysiology underlying such infarcts is difficult to ascertain without careful pathological study. However, the occurrence of multiple, small infarcts, linked closely in time but dispersed widely in the brain, raises the possibility of an embolic mechanism. The current study determines the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with well-defined lacunar syndromes and the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) evidence of multiple acute lesions.Sixty-two consecutive patients who presented to the emergency room with a clinically well-defined lacunar syndrome were studied by DWI within the first 3 days of admission.DWI showed multiple regions of increased signal intensity in 10 patients (16%). A hemispheric or brain stem lesion in a penetrator territory that accounted for the clinical syndrome ("index lesion") was found in all. DWI-hyperintense lesions other than the index lesion ("subsidiary infarctions") were punctate and lay within leptomeningeal artery territories in the majority. As opposed to patients with a single lacunar infarction, patients with a subsidiary infarction more frequently (P<0.05) harbored an identifiable cause of stroke.Almost 1 of every 6 patients presenting with a classic lacunar syndrome has multiple infarctions demonstrated on DWI. This DWI finding usually indicates an identifiable cause of stroke and therefore may influence clinical decisions regarding the extent of etiologic investigations and treatment for secondary prevention.

10680802|a|To determine the frequency and etiologic significance of multiple acute ischemic lesions in stroke.Although patients may have more than one stroke during the course of their lives, acute ischemic stroke is usually thought of as a single event. Using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), an MRI technique that detects ischemic injury within minutes after onset, we have often observed multiple acute ischemic lesions.The MRI scans of 59 consecutively studied patients were reviewed to determine the frequency and etiologic significance of multiple acute ischemic lesions on DWI.Multiple acute ischemic lesions were present in 10 (17%) of 59 patients. The lesions usually occurred within one major circulation (anterior or posterior), but in two patients (3%), lesions occurred in both cerebral hemispheres or in the anterior and the posterior circulations. The lesions often were small and resulted from presumed multiple emboli or the break-up of an embolus. Two patients had internal carotid artery occlusive disease and four had a cardiac or aortic source. In the other four patients the source was not determined. Lesions larger than 1 cm in diameter progressed to infarction, but some smaller lesions were not seen on follow-up T2-weighted imaging.Multiple acute stroke lesions on DWI are common and could be caused by multiple emboli or the breakup of an embolus. In some cases it might become possible to make early inferences concerning the stroke mechanism that could be of use for immediately directing the clinical work-up and treatment of the patient.

14981173|a|To study the association between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) characteristics and stroke etiology, stroke severity, and functional outcome in patients with infratentorial strokes.The authors prospectively studied 22 consecutive patients with acute infratentorial strokes. They used a blinded comparison of DWI features (number, distribution, and volume of lesions) with clinical characteristics, namely, stroke etiology (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment [TOAST] classification), severity (NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS]), length of stay (LOS), and functional 3-month outcome using modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, and a dichotomized outcome status (living at home vs institutionalization or death).Acute infratentorial DWI lesions were detected in 95% (21/22) of the patients. The number (p = 0.01) and the distribution (p < 0.001) of DWI lesions were correlated with stroke etiology. Patients with cardioembolic strokes (n = 5) had more DWI lesions (8.0 +/- 6.0) than those with other stroke etiologies (n = 17; 1.3 +/- 0.9; p < 0.001). Their lesion distribution differed from that of patients with noncardioembolic strokes (p < 0.001). Clinically silent, acute DWI lesions in the anterior circulation in addition to their infratentorial lesions were visualized in 3 of 5 patients with cardioembolic stroke and in none of 17 patients without sources of cardioembolism (p < 0.001). Pure infratentorial lesions were present in 15 of 17 patients with noncardioembolic strokes and in none of 5 cardioembolic stroke patients (p < 0.001). DWI lesion volume was not correlated with NIHSS score, LOS, outcome scores, or outcome status.In infratentorial strokes, multiple DWI lesions and a distribution of subsidiary, clinically silent DWI lesions in the anterior circulation suggest a cardioembolic stroke etiology. However, DWI lesion volume did not correlate with the NIHSS score and was no predictor of outcome.

15377688|a|To seek evidence of potential embolic sources or other stroke mechanisms in patients who, on chance observation, had several apparently recent small subcortical infarcts on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI).Patients presenting with stroke and multiple hyperintense subcortical infarcts visible on DWI were identified prospectively. Detailed clinical and radiological assessments were done independently and blinded to each other.Of 10 patients with multiple hyperintense subcortical infarcts on DWI, a definite embolic source was identified in only one. Most patients were hypertensive and smoked. The DWI appearance suggested that the subcortical lesions had occurred within several weeks rather than at exactly the same time. Most patients also had significant white matter hyperintensities and four had microhaemorrhages.Embolic sources were not identified in most patients but they did have systemic vascular risk factors and brain imaging features of "small vessel disease." A more generalised intrinsic process affecting many small cerebral vessels contemporaneously could explain multiple acute small subcortical infarcts. White matter hyperintensities, microhaemorrhages, and multiple small subcortical infarcts may share a common pathophysiological mechanism such as a diffuse cerebral microvascular abnormality which requires further exploration.

15459510|a|Age-related white matter changes (ARWMC) on brain MRI have been associated with cognitive, motor, mood and urinary disturbances. These factors are known to contribute to disability in elderly people, but the impact of ARWMC and of their progression on the transition to disability is not determined. The LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability in the Elderly) study aims at assessing the role of ARWMC as an independent predictor of the transition to disability in initially nondisabled elderly (65-84 years). Subjects who are not impaired or impaired on only 1 item of the Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) scale, presenting with different grades of ARWMC severity, were enrolled. Eleven European centers are involved. All the patients were assessed at baseline using an extensive set of clinical and functional tests including global functioning, cognitive, motor, psychiatric and quality of life measures. MRI studies were performed at baseline and will be repeated at the end of the follow-up period to evaluate changes of ARWMC and other lesions. ARWMC were categorized into mild, moderate or severe using the scale of Fazekas et al. For each ARWMC severity class, the primary study outcome is the transition to disability defined as an impairment on 2 or more IADL scale items. Secondary outcomes are the occurrence of dementia, depression, vascular events or death. Six-hundred and thirty-nine subjects (mean age 74.13 +/- 5.0 years, M/F: 288/351) were enrolled in a hospital-based setting and are being followed up for up to 3 years. The large and comprehensive set of measures in LADIS enables a comprehensive description of their functional and clinical features to be examined in relation to different morphological patterns and severity of ARWMC. The longitudinal design will give insight into the possible role of ARWMC and their progression as an independent contributor to disability in the elderly, eventually helping to develop preventive strategies to reduce the burden of disability in late life. The study results may also help to standardize, on an international basis, tools and criteria to identify early stages of disability.

959702|a|The basilar communicating artery (or mesencephalic artery) gives off more often one than two paramedian thalamic arteries. The paramedian territory, infero-medial, has a variable extent. It can include the polar territory when the polar artery does not exist. The paramedian artery arises as often from the controlateral basilar communicating artery than from the ipsilateral one.

11153886|a|To determine clinical, behavioral, topographic and etiological patterns in patients with simultaneous bilateral thalamic infarction in varied thalamic artery territories, we studied 16 patients who were admitted to our stroke unit over a 7-year period. Patients with bithalamic infarction represented 0.6% of our registry which included 2,750 ischaemic stroke patients. On computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement, there were 4 topographic patterns of infarction: 1) bilateral infarcts in the territory of paramedian artery (8 patients [50%]); 2) bilateral infarcts in the territory of thalamogeniculate arteries (3 patients [19%]); 3) bilateral infarcts involving territory of paramedian and thalamogeniculate arteries (3 patients [19%]); 4) bilateral infarcts involving territory of polar and thalamogeniculate arteries (2 patients [13%]). A specific clinical picture was found in up to 50% of the patients with bithalamic infarction. This included patients with bilateral paramedian infarction having disorder of consciousness, memory dysfunctions, various types of vertical gaze palsy and psychic changes. Bilateral sensory loss predicted accurately bilateral infarction in the territory of thalamogeniculate arteries. The main cause of bilateral thalamic infarction was small artery-disease, followed by cardioembolism. Cognitive functions in patients with bilateral paramedian infarction did not change significantly during the follow-up, in contrast to those with infarcts in varied arterial territories. Acute bilateral infarction involving both thalamus is uncommon, although they are often associated with specific neurologic-neuropsychological patterns, allowing diagnosis before radiological examination.

12154256|a|The clinical diagnosis of subcortical cerebral infarction is inaccurate for lesion location and pathogenesis. Clinically suspected small perforating artery occlusions may be embolic infarcts, with important implications for investigation and treatment. New MRI techniques may allow more accurate determination of the stroke mechanism soon after admission.In a prospective series of 106 patients evaluated with acute diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) within 24 hours of stroke, we enrolled 19 with a lacunar syndrome. On the basis of the topography, DWI and PWI findings, and outcome T2 MRI, we determined whether the mechanism of infarction was single perforating vessel occlusion or large artery embolism.Thirteen patients had pure motor stroke, 2 had ataxic hemiparesis, and 4 had sensorimotor stroke. Six patients had lacunes on MRI, none with PWI lesions. Four patients had subcortical and distal cortical infarcts on DWI. Nine had solitary restricted striatocapsular infarcts. Seven of these 9 had PWI studies, 5 with PWI lesions. The presence of a PWI lesion reliably differentiated striatocapsular from lacunar infarction for solitary small subcortical infarcts (P=0.03).DWI and PWI altered the final diagnosis of infarct pathogenesis from small perforating artery occlusion to large artery embolism in 13 of 19 patients presenting with lacunar syndromes. Lacunes cannot be reliably diagnosed on clinical grounds.

10766882|a|The Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP) classification is a simple clinical scheme for subdividing first ever acute stroke. Several small studies have shown that when an infarct is visible on CT or MRI, the classification predicts its site in about three quarters of patients. The aim was to further investigate this relation in a much larger cohort of patients in hospital with ischaemic stroke.Between 1994 and 1997, inpatients and outpatients with ischaemic stroke were assessed by one of several stroke physicians who noted the OCSP classification. A neuroradiologist classified the site and extent of recent infarction on CT or MRI.Of 1012 patients with ischaemic stroke, 655 (65%) had recent visible infarcts. These radiological lesions were appropriate to the clinical classification in 69/87 (79%) patients with a total anterior circulation syndrome, 213/298 (71%) with a partial anterior circulation syndrome, 105/144 (73%) with a lacunar syndrome, and 105/126 (83%) with a posterior circulation syndrome. Overall, 75% of patients with visible infarcts were correctly classified clinically. If patients without a visible infarct did have an appropriate lesion in the brain (best case), the classification would have correctly predicted its site and size in 849/1012 (84%) patients, compared with only 492/1012 (49%) in the worst case scenario.The OCSP classification predicted the site of infarct in three quarters of patients. When an infarct is visible on brain imaging, the site of the infarct should guide the use of further investigations, but if an infarct is not seen, the OCSP classification could be used to predict its likely size and site.

10519882|a|Patients with a lacunar stroke syndrome may have cortical infarcts on brain imaging rather than lacunar infarcts, and patients with the clinical features of a small cortical stroke (partial anterior circulation syndrome, PACS) may have lacunar infarcts on imaging. The aim was to compare risk factors and outcome in lacunar syndrome (LACS) with cortical infarct, LACS with lacunar infarct, PACS with cortical infarct, and PACS with lacunar infarct to determine whether the clinical syndrome should be modified according to brain imaging. As part of a hospital stroke registry, patients with first ever stroke from 1990 to 1998 were assessed by a stroke physician who assigned a clinical classification using clinical features only. A neuroradiologist classified recent clinically relevant infarcts on brain imaging as cortical, posterior cerebral artery territory or lacunar. Of 1772 first ever strokes, there were 637 patients with PACS and 377 patients with LACS who had CT or MRI. Recent infarcts were seen in 395 PACS and 180 LACS. Atrial fibrillation was more common in PACS with cortical than lacunar infarcts (OR 2.3, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.9-5.5), and in LACS with cortical than lacunar infarcts (OR 3.9, 1.2-12). Severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis or occlusion was more common in PACS with cortical than lacunar infarcts (OR 3.5, 1.3-9.5); and in LACS with cortical than lacunar infarcts (OR 3.7, 1.1-12). In conclusion, patients with cortical infarcts are more likely to have severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis or atrial fibrillation than those with lacunar infarcts irrespective of the presenting clinical syndrome. Brain imaging should modify the clinical classification and influence patient investigation.

7644045|a|Lacunar infarction is an important stroke subgroup with unique clinical and pathologic features, but its relative risks for associated risk factors have been rarely documented. To address this matter, we studied 203 consecutive patients with first-ever stroke due to lacunar infarction admitted to four general hospitals during the period 1985 to 1992.We obtained information concerning risk factor exposure status among the patients by interview using a structured questionnaire and by comparison with age- and sex-matched neighborhood controls. Odds ratios were estimated with adjustment for confounding variables by using multivariate logistic regression.Significantly increasing the risk of lacunar stroke were hypertension (with an odds ratio of 8.9 [95% confidence intervals 4.2, 18.8]), current smoking (6.6 [2.9, 14.8]), and diabetes (2.3 [1.0, 5.5]), whereas frequent physical exercise was associated with a significantly decreased risk (0.3 [0.1, 0.7]). There was no risk of lacunar stroke associated with heart disease (odds ratio 1.0 [0.5, 1.9]).Patients with hypertension or diabetes, and those who currently smoke, are at a higher risk of lacunar stroke, whereas those who undertake regular physical exercise may be at lower risk. The high risk associated with hypertension but absent risk with heart disease supports the "lacunar hypothesis" of a unique pathophysiologic mechanism for lacunar stroke.

10797169|a|The purpose of the present study was to assess the diagnostic usefulness of early diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and MR angiography (MRA) in patients with ischemic stroke. Past approaches to stroke diagnosis required a series of diagnostic tests over several days of hospitalization. New magnetic resonance methodologies that include DWI and MRA may allow more rapid characterization of stroke pathophysiology. However, no previous study has assessed the impact on formal stroke subtype diagnosis of early imaging with DWI/MRA.We analyzed 46 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent DWI/MRA within 24 hours of admission. Initial diagnoses were rendered with use of the 2 most widely used formal stroke subtype classification schemes, the TOAST and the Oxfordshire methods, which were applied to patients after CT/conventional MRI but before DWI/MRA. Modified TOAST and Oxfordshire diagnoses were then rendered based on the results of day 1 DWI, MRA, and DWI plus MRA. Final TOAST/Oxfordshire diagnoses at discharge were taken as the gold standard.Compared with final diagnoses, pre-MRI TOAST diagnoses matched final diagnoses in 48%, improving to 83% after DWI alone, 56% after MRA alone, and 94% after DWI plus MRA. For the TOAST diagnostic subtypes of large-vessel atherothromboembolism and small-vessel disease, pre-MRI diagnoses matched final diagnoses in 56% and 35% of patients, respectively, improving to 89% and 100% after DWI/MRA. Pre-MRI Oxfordshire diagnoses matched final diagnoses in 67% of patients, improving to 100% after DWI.The use of DWI/MRA within 24 hours of hospitalization substantially improves the accuracy of the diagnosis of early ischemic stroke subtype. When initial management and clinical trial eligibility decisions are influenced by stroke subtype, day 1 multimodal MRI is advantageous as a guide to therapy.

11459902|a|The objective was to assess the frequency of pure motor stroke caused by different stroke subtypes and to compare demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and outcome data of pure motor stroke with those of patients with other lacunar stroke as well as with those of patients with non-lacunar stroke. Data from 2000 patients with acute stroke (n=1761) or transient ischaemic attack (n=239) admitted consecutively to the department of neurology of an acute care 350 bed teaching hospital were prospectively collected in the Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona stroke registry over a 10 year period. For the purpose of the study 222 (12.7%) patients with pure motor stroke were selected. The other study groups included 218 (12.3%) patients with other lacunar strokes and 1321 (75%) patients with non-lacunar stroke. In relation to stroke subtype, lacunar infarcts were found in 189 (85%) patients, whereas ischaemic lacunar syndromes not due to lacunar infarcts occurred in 23 (10.4%) patients (atherothrombotic stroke in 12, cardioembolic stroke in seven, infarction of undetermined origin in three, and infarction of unusual aetiology in one) and haemorrhagic lacunar syndromes in 10 (4.5%). Patients with pure motor stroke showed a better outcome than patients with non-lacunar stroke with a significantly lower number of complications and in hospital mortality rate, shorter duration of hospital stay, and a higher number of symptom free patients at hospital discharge. After multivariate analysis, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, non-sudden stroke onset, internal capsule involvement, and pons topography seemed to be independent factors of pure motor stroke in patients with acute stroke. In conclusion, about one of every 10 patients with acute stroke had a pure motor stroke. Pure motor stroke was caused by a lacunar infarct in 85% of patients and by other stroke subtypes in 15%. Several clinical features are more frequent in patients with pure motor stroke than in patients with non-lacunar stroke.

Using the criterion of the presence or absence of established risk factors (hypertension or diabetes mellitus) for small artery disease (SAD), the SSI-AF group we also subdivided into two groups, SSI-AF-SAD+ (n=22) and SSI-AF-SAD- (n=5) and their characteristics compared.Although the lack of any significant difference in the distribution of hypertension and diabetes mellitus between the SSI-AF and SSI-control groups emphasises SAD as a common cause of infarct in SSI-AF, the presence of AF-together with the higher frequency of neuropsychological disturbances in the SSI-AF group versus the SSI-control group (15% v 2%; p=0.066)-favours cardioembolism as a potential cause of infarct in several patients. The characteristic factors seen more often in the SSI-AF-SAD- group compared with the SSI-AF-SAD+ group were secondary haemorrhagic transformation, faciobrachial pure motor weakness, subinsular involvement, and better recovery of neurological deficits.The study suggests that either SAD or cardioembolism can be the cause of SSI in patients with AF. Atrial fibrillation is not always coincidental in patients with SSI and a clinical lacunar stroke. Certain clinical and radiological findings may be useful in differentiating cardioembolism from SAD in patients with SSI.

12052988|a|A small centrum ovale infarct (SCOI), caused by occlusion of the white matter medullary arteries, is often equated with a lacunar infarct. We sought to clarify the clinical characteristics of a SCOI visualized by diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) compared with those of a small basal ganglia infarct (SBGI).Patients with a SCOI (SCOI group; n=38) or SBGI (SBGI group; n=68) < or =15 mm in diameter on conventional MRI and DWI were selected from 582 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. Sex, age, neurological symptoms, vascular risk factors, emboligenic heart disease, arterial occlusive disease in the ipsilateral carotid system, and recurrent stroke within the initial 30 days were compared between the 2 groups.Only 47% of SCOIs but 87% of SBGIs could be identified with the use of conventional MRI, whereas DWI could detect them all. Age, sex, and vascular risk factors were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The SCOI group had more frequently an abrupt onset of symptoms (63% versus 26%; P=0.0002), emboligenic heart diseases (34% versus 12%; P=0.0054), occlusive carotid and/or middle cerebral artery diseases (53% versus 19%; P=0.0004), and recurrent stroke (13% versus 1%; P=0.0216) but less frequently a classic lacunar syndrome (50% versus 81%; P=0.0009) than the SBGI group. On a multivariate analysis, both arterial and heart diseases were independently associated with the SCOI group.Symptomatic SCOIs detected by DWI may be associated with large-vessel and heart diseases and should be distinguished from lacunar infarcts.

12624287|a|Autopsy studies found that lacunar strokes differ in the size of the underlying brain infarct and that small lacunes are usually caused by hypertensive small-artery disease (SAD) and larger ones by atheromatous or embolic perforator occlusion. These findings suggest that larger lacunar infarcts might cause more severe neurological deficits and a higher detection rate on brain imaging compared with lacunar strokes caused by SAD. This prospective observational study was performed to investigate whether (1) neurological outcome, (2) prevalence of stroke risk factors, (3) prevalence of clinically asymptomatic occlusive cerebral artery disease, and (4) detection rate of underlying lacunar infarcts at brain imaging differ in ischemic lacunar strokes with (non-SAD) and without potential etiologies other than SAD.Consecutive patients with lacunar stroke (n=244), defined by both clinical findings and brain imaging, were studied. Neurological deficit was quantified at presentation with the use of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and after 3 months with the NIHSS and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Cerebral arteries were investigated by ultrasound.Compared with patients with SAD lacunar strokes (n=155; 64%), patients with non-SAD lacunar strokes (n=89; 36%) had (1) higher NIHSS scores at presentation and higher NIHSS and mRS scores after 3 months (P<0.05); a higher prevalence of (2) hypertension (P<0.05), (3) coronary artery disease (P<0.0001), (4) previous transient ischemic attacks (P<0.01), and (5) asymptomatic stenoses of intracranial cerebral (P<0.01 to P<0.0001) and extracranial carotid (30% to 50% narrowing; P<0.01) arteries; and (6) a higher detection rate of the underlying lesion at brain imaging (P<0.01).Our data suggest that patients with non-SAD lacunar strokes have a worse clinical outcome and a higher prevalence of large cerebral and coronary artery disease than patients with SAD lacunar strokes.

10680800|a|To examine the relationship between carotid artery stenosis, other risk factors, and lacunar stroke.Carotid artery stenosis in patients presenting with lacune stroke may be coincidental or causal. The distinction by risk factor profile is uncertain. The risk and cause of subsequent stroke, and benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CE) is unknown.Stroke in patients entering the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial were classified as nonlacunar, possible lacune (symptoms without CT lacunae), or probable lacune (symptoms with CT lacunae).Of 1,158 patients with hemispheric stroke, 493 had features of lacunar stroke (283 possible and 210 probable). Lacunar stroke presented more commonly in patients with milder (<50%) degrees of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (p = 0.003). History of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, not hypertension, were associated independently even after accounting for the degree of stenosis. Medically treated patients presenting with nonlacunar stroke had a low risk of subsequent lacunar events of 2.9% at 3 years in comparison with 9.2% for probable lacunar presentation (p = 0.03). For patients with 50 to 99% ICA stenosis, the relative risk reductions (RRRs) in stroke from CE were 35% when the presenting stroke was probable lacunar versus 61% when the stroke was nonlacunar. Patients presenting with a possible lacunar stroke had a 53% RRR.History of diabetes and hyperlipidemia were more important than arterial hypertension as risk factors for patients with lacunar stroke. Patients presenting with lacunar stroke more often had milder ICA stenosis. Although CE reduced the risk of stroke in all patients with 50 to 99% ICA stenosis, lesser benefits were observed in patients presenting with lacunar stroke.

12738897|a|The presence of carotid stenosis (CS) in a patient with lacunar stroke is usually considered an indication of atherosclerosis and not directly related to the development of this infarction subtype. This study was designed to determine the relationship between CS and lacunar infarction (LI) and to assess the differences between single and multiple LIs.We classified 330 patients with a first-ever cerebral infarction in the carotid territory into LI and non-LI (NLI) groups. In the LI group, patients with a single LI and those with multiple LIs were identified. In this last subgroup, 2 patterns were identified: 1 subtype with lacunar lesions distributed in both cerebral hemispheres, and another with lesions predominantly in 1 hemisphere.In the LI group, isolated CS was significantly more frequent on the homolateral side than on the contralateral side (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 23; P=0.03). A significant relationship between the pattern of distribution of the infarctions in only 1 hemisphere and homolateral CS >70% was observed (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 0.9 to 19; P=0.03). In a multivariate analysis, the following variables were found to predict unilateral multiple LI: left ventricular hypertrophy (OR, 9.1; 95% CI, 2.5 to 33.6) and homolateral CS >75% (OR, 14.4; 95% CI, 2.0 to 99.6).The significant incidence of isolated ipsilateral CS in patients with LI located in the carotid territory and the relationship of CS to ipsilateral multiple LI suggest that CS has a very important role in the development of LI.

15980352|a|873140 is a novel CCR5 antagonist with potent in vitro anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity. This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single- and repeat-dose escalation investigation of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and food effect of 873140 in 70 adult subjects. During single-dose escalation, three cohorts (each composed of 10 subjects, with 8 subjects receiving the active drug and 2 subjects receiving the placebo [8 active and 2 placebo]) received doses of 50, 200, 400, 800, and 1,200 mg after an overnight fast, or 400 mg plus a standard high-fat breakfast in an alternating panel design. During repeat-dose escalation, four cohorts (each with 8 active and 2 placebo) received doses of 200, 400, 600, or 800 mg every 12 h (BID) for 8 days. Laboratory safety tests, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed at regular intervals, and blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetics. Single and repeat doses of 50 mg to 800 mg were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and no grade 3 or 4 adverse events. The mild-to-moderate side effects were primarily gastrointestinal and included abdominal cramping, nausea, and diarrhea. No specific trends in laboratory parameters or clinically significant ECG changes were noted. Plasma 873140 concentrations increased rapidly; the median time to maximum concentration of drug in serum was 1.75 to 5 h. The median area under the plasma concentration-time profile (AUC) and the maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)) ranged from 127 ng.h/ml and 24 ng/ml at 200 mg BID to 329 ng.h/ml and 100 ng/ml at 800 mg BID, respectively. Food consumption increased the AUC and C(max) by a mean of 1.7- and 2.2-fold, respectively. The pharmacokinetic and safety profile supports the continued investigation of 873140 with HIV-infected subjects.

Blocking viral entry via this receptor reduces the viral load in patients infected with HIV, suggesting that a CCR5 antagonist could become a key component in the treatment of HIV-compromised patients. A number of CCR5 antagonists are currently in clinical trials. This review details the status of leading agents and highlights recent advances in the development of new CCR5 antagonists.

10358771|a|In addition to CD4, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) requires a coreceptor for entry into target cells. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5, members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, have been identified as the principal coreceptors for T cell line-tropic and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates, respectively. The updated coreceptor repertoire includes numerous members, mostly chemokine receptors and related orphans. These discoveries provide a new framework for understanding critical features of the basic biology of HIV-1, including the selective tropism of individual viral variants for different CD4+ target cells and the membrane fusion mechanism governing virus entry. The coreceptors also provide molecular perspectives on central puzzles of HIV-1 disease, including the selective transmission of macrophage-tropic variants, the appearance of T cell line-tropic variants in many infected persons during progression to AIDS, and differing susceptibilities of individuals to infection and disease progression. Genetic findings have yielded major insights into the in vivo roles of individual coreceptors and their ligands; of particular importance is the discovery of an inactivating mutation in the CCR5 gene which, in homozygous form, confers strong resistance to HIV-1 infection. Beyond providing new perspectives on fundamental aspects of HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis, the coreceptors suggest new avenues for developing novel therapeutic and preventative strategies to combat the AIDS epidemic.

15452338|a|This article describes the automation of an in vitro cell-based fusion assay for the identification of novel inhibitors of receptor mediated HIV-1 entry. The assay utilises two stable cell lines: one expressing CD4, CCR5 and an LTR-promoter/beta-galactosidase reporter construct, and the other expressing gp160 and tat. Accumulation of beta-galactosidase can only occur following fusion of these two cell lines via the gp160 and receptor mediators, as this event facilitates the transfer of the tat transcription factor between the two cell types. Although similar cell fusion systems have been described previously, they have not met the requirements for HTS due to complexity, throughput and reagent cost. The assay described in this article provides significant advantage, as (a) no transfection/infection events are required prior to the assay, reducing the potential for variability, (b) cells are mixed in solution, enhancing fusion efficiency compared to adherent cells, (c) miniaturization to low volume enables screening in 384-well plates; and (d) online cell dispensing facilitates automated screening. This assay has been employed to screen approximately 650,000 compounds in a singleton format. The data demonstrate that the assay is robust, with a Z' consistently above 0.6, which compares favourably with less complex biochemical assays.

11160301|a|The chemokine receptor CCR5 is expressed on the majority of T cells and monocytes in the inflammatory infiltrate of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, renal diseases, and multiple sclerosis. In contrast, little expression of CCR5 is found on peripheral blood leukocytes. A specific depletion of CCR5(+) cells could therefore be a useful strategy to reduce the cellular infiltrate in chronic inflammations. Moreover, CCR5 is the major coreceptor for M-tropic HIV-1 strains. Depletion of CCR5(+) leukocytes may help to eliminate cells latently infected with HIV-1. We designed two constructs that specifically destroy chemokine receptor-positive cells. The first construct, a bispecific Ab, binds simultaneously to CCR5 and CD3. Thereby it redirects CD3(+) T cells against CCR5(+) target cells. The Ab specifically depletes CCR5(+) T cells and monocytes, but is inactive against cells that do not express CCR5. Furthermore, ex vivo the bispecific Ab eliminated >95% of CCR5(+) monocytes and T cells from the synovial fluid of patients with arthritis. Also, we designed a fusion protein of the chemokine RANTES and a truncated version of Pseudomonas. exotoxin A. The fusion protein binds to CCR5 and down-modulates the receptor from the cell surface. The chemokine toxin completely destroyed CCR5(+) Chinese hamster ovary cells at a concentration of 10 nM, whereas no cytotoxic effect was detectable against CCR5(-) Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both constructs efficiently deplete CCR5-positive cells, appear as useful agents in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, and may help to eradicate HIV-1 by increasing the turnover of latently infected cells.

12457443|a|Despite the overall success of antiretroviral medications in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection, many patients on treatment suffer progressive disease due to intolerance or the development of resistant viral strains. Consequently, considerable research focuses on the development of new classes of antiretroviral agents with mechanisms of action different to the current classes. Enfuvirtide (T-20, pentafuside, Fuzeon), the first drug of a new class of antiretroviral medications known as fusion inhibitors, blocks the fusion of the virus particle with the host target cell. The viral entry process begins with the attachment of viral surface glycoprotein gp120 to the host cell CD4 and chemokine receptor sites. Viral gp41 then undergoes a conformational change enabling fusion of both membranes, a critical step in the viral life cycle. Enfuvirtide is a synthetic peptide that binds to gp41, preventing the conformational change required for membrane fusion. Based on potent in vitro activity, a Phase I clinical trial of intravenous enfuvirtide was conducted that demonstrated a substantial decline in HIV plasma viral load in the highest dose group and no serious adverse effects. Phase II trials evaluated regimens of both continuous subcutaneous infusions and intermittent subcutaneous injections. Intermittent injections were pharmacokinetically superior to continuous infusions and were associated with fewer administration difficulties. For some subjects who added enfuvirtide monotherapy to an already failing regimen, the beneficial effect on viral load reduction appeared short-lived, suggesting the development of resistance. Two large randomised clinical trials comparing "optimised background" (best available, individualised regimens based on patient history and resistance assays) versus optimised background plus enfuvirtide have recently shown a significant virological advantage (approximately 1 log(10) difference from controls) at 24 weeks. In all trials to date, very few significant adverse effects have been seen--minor injection site reactions are frequent, but rarely treatment limiting. Based on these studies, enfuvirtide will likely play a significant role in the treatment of patients with limited treatment options.

8525373|a|Evidence suggests that CD8+ T lymphocytes are involved in the control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in vivo, either by cytolytic mechanisms or by the release of HIV-suppressive factors (HIV-SF). The chemokines RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta were identified as the major HIV-SF produced by CD8+ T cells. Two active proteins purified from the culture supernatant of an immortalized CD8+ T cell clone revealed sequence identity with human RANTES and MIP-1 alpha. RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta were released by both immortalized and primary CD8+ T cells. HIV-SF activity produced by these cells was completely blocked by a combination of neutralizing antibodies against RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta. Recombinant human RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta induced a dose-dependent inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). These data may have relevance for the prevention and therapy of AIDS.

9625760|a|Chemokines are essential mediators of normal leukocyte trafficking as well as of leukocyte recruitment during inflammation. We describe here a novel non-ELR CXC chemokine identified through sequence analysis of cDNAs derived from cytokine-activated primary human astrocytes. This novel chemokine, referred to as I-TAC (interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant), is regulated by interferon (IFN) and has potent chemoattractant activity for interleukin (IL)-2-activated T cells, but not for freshly isolated unstimulated T cells, neutrophils, or monocytes. I-TAC interacts selectively with CXCR3, which is the receptor for two other IFN-inducible chemokines, the IFN-gamma-inducible 10-kD protein (IP-10) and IFN-gamma- induced human monokine (HuMig), but with a significantly higher affinity. In addition, higher potency and efficacy of I-TAC over IP-10 and HuMig is demonstrated by transient mobilization of intracellular calcium as well as chemotactic migration in both activated T cells and transfected cell lines expressing CXCR3. Stimulation of astrocytes with IFN-gamma and IL-1 together results in an approximately 400,000-fold increase in I-TAC mRNA expression, whereas stimulating monocytes with either of the cytokines alone or in combination results in only a 100-fold increase in the level of I-TAC transcript. Moderate expression is also observed in pancreas, lung, thymus, and spleen. The high level of expression in IFN- and IL-1-stimulated astrocytes suggests that I-TAC could be a major chemoattractant for effector T cells involved in the pathophysiology of neuroinflammatory disorders, although I-TAC may also play a role in the migration of activated T cells during IFN-dominated immune responses.

CC CKR5 mRNA was detected constitutively in primary adherent monocytes but not in primary neutrophils or eosinophils. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, and RANTES were all potent agonists for CC CKR5 (EC50 = 3-30 nM) when calcium flux was measured in transfected HEK 293 cells, yet the apparent binding affinities of the corresponding iodinated chemokines to intact cells expressing the receptor were low (IC50 approximately 100 nM). The calcium flux responses were completely blocked by treatment of transfected cells with pertussis toxin. These data suggest that CC CKR5 is a G(i)-coupled receptor that may mediate monocyte responses to MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES.

10728472|a|Fusion of HIV with its host cell requires the interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120) with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 [T cell-tropic (T-tropic) or X4 HIV strains] or CCR5 [macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) or R5 HIV strains] followed by a 'spring-loaded' action of the glycoprotein 41 (gp41) that ensures fusion of the viral and cellular lipid membranes and permits the viral nucleocapsid to enter the cell. The overall fusion process can be blocked by a number of compounds. These include siamycin analogues, SPC 3 (a synthetic peptide derived from the V3 domain of gp120), pentafuside (T 20, DP 178) [a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 127 to 162 of gp41], the betulinic acid derivative RPR 103611, TAK 779 (a low molecular weight non-peptide CCR5 antagonist) and a number of compounds (T 22, T 134, ALX40-4C, CGP64222 and AMD 3100) that are targeted at the CXCR4 receptor. In particular, the bicyclam AMD 3100 has proved highly potent and selective as a CXCR4 antagonist that blocks the infectivity of X4 HIV strains in the nanomolar concentration range. The proof-of-concept that fusion inhibitors should be able to suppress viral replication in vivo has been demonstrated with pentafuside. Pentafuside and AMD 3100 have now proceeded to phase II clinical trials.

8791590|a|The chemokine receptor 5 (CKR5) protein serves as a secondary receptor on CD4(+) T lymphocytes for certain strains of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). The CKR5 structural gene was mapped to human chromosome 3p21, and a 32-base pair deletion allele (CKR5Delta32) was identified that is present at a frequency of approximately0.10 in the Caucasian population of the United States. An examination of 1955 patients included among six well-characterized acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cohort studies revealed that 17 deletion homozygotes occurred exclusively among 612 exposed HIV-1 antibody-negative individuals (2.8 percent) and not at all in 1343 HIV-1-infected individuals. The frequency of CKR5 deletion heterozygotes was significantly elevated in groups of individuals that had survived HIV-1 infection for more than 10 years, and, in some risk groups, twice as frequent as their occurrence in rapid progressors to AIDS. Survival analysis clearly shows that disease progression is slower in CKR5 deletion heterozygotes than in individuals homozygous for the normal CKR5 gene. The CKR5Delta32 deletion may act as a recessive restriction gene against HIV-1 infection and may exert a dominant phenotype of delaying progression to AIDS among infected individuals.

11507206|a|T-20 is a synthetic peptide that corresponds to 36 amino acids within the C-terminal heptad repeat region (HR2) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41. T-20 has been shown to potently inhibit viral replication of HIV-1 both in vitro and in vivo and is currently being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial. T-649 is an inhibitory peptide that also corresponds to 36 amino acids within HR2. This sequence overlaps the T-20 sequence but is shifted 10 residues toward the N terminus of gp41. Both inhibitors are thought to exert their antiviral activity by interfering with the conformational changes that occur within gp41 to promote membrane fusion following gp120 interactions with CD4 and coreceptor molecules. We have shown previously that coreceptor specificity defined by the V3 loop of gp120 modulates sensitivity to T-20 and that a critical region within the N-terminal heptad repeat (HR1) of gp41 is the major determinant of sensitivity (C. A. Derdeyn et al., J. Virol. 74:8358-8367, 2000). This report shows that (i) regions within gp41 distinct from those associated with T-20 sensitivity govern the baseline sensitivity to T-649 and (ii) T-649 sensitivity of chimeric viruses that contain sequences derived from CXCR4- and CCR5-specific envelopes is also modulated by coreceptor specificity. Moreover, the pattern of sensitivity of CCR5-specific chimeras with only minor differences in their V3 loop was consistent for both inhibitors, suggesting that the individual affinity for coreceptor may influence accessibility of these inhibitors to their target sequence. Finally, an analysis of the sensitivity of 55 primary, inhibitor-naive HIV-1 isolates found that higher concentrations of T-20 (P < 0.001) and T-649 (P = 0.016) were required to inhibit CCR5-specific viruses compared to viruses that utilize CXCR4. The results presented here implicate gp120-coreceptor interactions in driving the complex conformational changes that occur in gp41 to promote fusion and entry and suggest that sensitivity to different HR1-directed fusion inhibitors is governed by distinct regions of gp41 but is consistently modulated by coreceptor specificity.

12970437|a|BMS-378806 is a recently discovered small-molecule human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) attachment inhibitor with good antiviral activity and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we demonstrate that the compound targets viral entry by inhibiting the binding of the HIV-1 envelope gp120 protein to cellular CD4 receptors via a specific and competitive mechanism. BMS-378806 binds directly to gp120 at a stoichiometry of approximately 1:1, with a binding affinity similar to that of soluble CD4. The potential BMS-378806 target site was localized to a specific region within the CD4 binding pocket of gp120 by using HIV-1 gp120 variants carrying either compound-selected resistant substitutions or gp120-CD4 contact site mutations. Mapping of resistance substitutions to the HIV-1 envelope, and the lack of compound activity against a CD4-independent viral infection confirm the gp120-CD4 interactions as the target in infected cells. BMS-378806 therefore serves as a prototype for this new class of antiretroviral agents and validates gp120 as a viable target for small-molecule inhibitors.

10422650|a|Transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human alpha2A-, alpha2B- and alpha2C-adrenoceptor subtypes were used to monitor alpha2-adrenoceptor-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. Incubation with 100 microM (-)-adrenaline resulted in stimulation of pertussis toxin-sensitive GTPase by 380% after activation of the alpha2A-subtype, by 320% after activation of the alpha2B-subtype and by 110% after activation of the alpha2C-subtype. The agonists dexmedetomidine, UK14,304 (5-bromo-6-[2-imidazoline-2-ylamino]quinoxaline) and oxymetazoline showed subtype-dependent efficacy. Dexmedetomidine was a full agonist at the alpha2B-subtype and a partial agonist at the alpha2A- and the alpha2C-subtypes. UK14,304 was a full agonist at the alpha2A-subtype and a partial agonist at the other two. Oxymetazoline showed strong partial agonism at the alpha2B-subtype (63% of adrenaline), but did not significantly activate the alpha2A- and the alpha2C-subtypes. These results agreed with cAMP accumulation experiments carried out with cell lines endogenously expressing the alpha2A-subtype (human erythroleukemia, HEL) or the alpha2B-subtype (neuroblastoma-glioma, NG108-15). The GTPase assay may thus provide a valuable tool for the identification of subtype-selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists.

12462129|a|With the discovery that CCR5 is the critical protein required for infection by M-tropic HIV, has come huge research efforts, both in academia and industry, to try to exploit this finding. Thus, research advances in the fields of virology, structural protein chemistry, and receptor pharmacology have combined to add a new understanding to the process of HIV fusion and possible mechanisms to prevent HIV entry. This review will approach this field from a receptor pharmacology viewpoint and outline some concepts of receptor allosterism and protein-protein interaction which may be relevant to CCR5 blockade. Many of these ideas may be explored in a practical sense with the advent of new small molecule CCR5 inhibitors currently entering the clinic.

14754431|a|A global effort has been undertaken to control human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) though the development of vaccines and pharmacologics. Current FDA approved pharmacological inhibitors target two of the three viral enzymes critical to replication and maturation of infectious viral particles: reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (Pr). Although combination therapies targeting RT and Pr have significantly reduced AIDS related morbidity and mortality, resistance to individual inhibitors is a growing concern. Currently, there are six protease inhibitors in clinical use. These inhibitors target the active site of protease using peptidomimetic transition state analogs based on natural substrates. However, treatment failures arise as a lack of compliance due to HIV-inhibitor pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and tolerance. This allows reduced HIV-inhibitor pressure, increased viral replication, and the emergence of drug resistant mutations. Continued use of protease inhibitors in the face of incomplete viral suppression may result in HIV-1 escape mutants not only being resistant to the protease inhibitor used, but to all clinically available protease inhibitors. Thus, new broad-based protease inhibitors are needed to control the emerging multi-drug, cross-resistant HIV-1. Moreover, given the emergence of cross-resistant HIV-1, there is a need to target novel protease structural sites to reduce the risk of multi-drug cross-resistance. In this review, we discuss the resistance to protease inhibitors and the rationale for new strategies towards drug design for suppressing protease activity. We focus on the structure and function relationship and the influence that drug resistance mutants exert on the evolution of HIV-1 protease.

12930892|a|BMS-378806 is a recently discovered small molecule HIV-1 inhibitor that blocks viral entrance to cells. The compound exhibits potent inhibitory activity against a panel of R5-(virus using the CCR5 coreceptor), X4-(virus using the CXCR4 coreceptor), and R5/X4 HIV-1 laboratory and clinical isolates of the B subtype (median EC50 of 0.04 microM) in culture assays. BMS-378806 is selective for HIV-1 and inactive against HIV-2, SIV and a panel of other viruses, and exhibits no significant cytotoxicity in the 14 cell types tested (concentration for 50% reduction of cell growth, >225 microM). Mechanism of action studies demonstrated that BMS-378806 binds to gp120 and inhibits the interactions of the HIV-1 envelope protein to cellular CD4 receptors. Further confirmation that BMS-378806 targets the envelope in infected cells was obtained through the isolation of resistant variants and the mapping of resistance substitutions to the HIV-1 envelope. In particular, two substitutions, M426L and M475I, are situated in the CD4 binding pocket of gp120. Recombinant HIV-1 carrying these two substitutions demonstrated significantly reduced susceptibility to compound inhibition. BMS-378806 displays many favorable pharmacological traits, such as low protein binding, minimal human serum effect on anti-HIV-1 potency, good oral bioavailability in animal species, and a clean safety profile in initial animal toxicology studies. Together, the data show that BMS-378806 is a representative of a new class of HIV inhibitors that has the potential to become a valued addition to our current armamentarium of antiretroviral drugs.

12167680|a|Among persons in North America who are newly infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the prevalence of transmitted resistance to antiretroviral drugs has been estimated at 1 to 11 percent.We performed a retrospective analysis of susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs before treatment and drug-resistance mutations in HIV in plasma samples from 377 subjects with primary HIV infection who had not yet received treatment and who were identified between May 1995 and June 2000 in 10 North American cities. Responses to treatment could be evaluated in 202 subjects.Over the five-year period, the frequency of transmitted drug resistance increased significantly. The frequency of high-level resistance to one or more drugs (indicated by a value of more than 10 for the ratio of the 50 percent inhibitory concentration [IC50] for the subject's virus to the IC50 for a drug-sensitive reference virus) increased from 3.4 percent during the period from 1995 to 1998 to 12.4 percent during the period from 1999 to 2000 (P=0.002), and the frequency of multidrug resistance increased from 1.1 percent to 6.2 percent (P=0.01). The frequency of resistance mutations detected by sequence analysis increased from 8.0 percent to 22.7 percent (P<0.001), and the frequency of multidrug resistance detected by sequence analysis increased from 3.8 percent to 10.2 percent (P=0.05). Among subjects infected with drug-resistant virus, the time to viral suppression after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy was longer (P=0.05), and the time to virologic failure was shorter (P=0.05).The proportion of new HIV infections that involve drug-resistant virus is increasing in North America. Initial antiretroviral therapy is more likely to fail in patients who are infected with drug-resistant virus. Testing for resistance to drugs before therapy begins is now indicated even for recently infected patients.

8756719|a|Rare individuals have been multiply exposed to HIV-1 but remain uninfected. The CD4+ T-cells of two of these individuals, designated EU2 and EU3, are highly resistant in vitro to the entry of primary macrophagetropic virus but are readily infectable with transformed T-cell line adapted viruses. We report here on the genetic basis of this resistance. We found that EU2 and EU3 have a homozygous defect in CKR-5, the gene encoding the recently described coreceptor for primary HIV-1 isolates. These individuals appear to have inherited a defective CKR-5 allele that contains an internal 32 base pair deletion. The encoded protein is severely truncated and cannot be detected at the cell surface. Surprisingly, this defect has no obvious phenotype in the affected individuals. Thus, a CKR-5 allele present in the human population appears to protect homozygous individuals from sexual transmission of HIV-1. Heterozygous individuals are quite common (approximately 20%) in some populations. These findings indicate the importance of CKR-5 in HIV-1 transmission and suggest that targeting the HIV-1-CKR-5 interaction may provide a means of preventing or slowing disease progression.

9547333|a|CCR5, a chemokine receptor expressed on T cells and macrophages, is the principal coreceptor for M-tropic HIV-1 strains. Recently, we described an NH2-terminal modification of the CCR5 ligand regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), aminooxypentane-RANTES (AOP-RANTES), that showed potent inhibition of macrophage infection by HIV-1 under conditions where RANTES was barely effective. To investigate the mechanism of AOP-RANTES inhibition of HIV infectivity we examined the surface expression of CCR5 using a monoclonal anti-CCR5 antibody, MC-1. We demonstrate that AOP-RANTES rapidly caused >90% decrease in cell surface expression of CCR5 on lymphocytes, monocytes/ macrophages, and CCR5 transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. RANTES also caused a loss of cell surface CCR5, although its effect was less than with AOP-RANTES. Significantly, AOP-RANTES inhibited recycling of internalized CCR5 to the cell surface, whereas RANTES did not. When peripheral blood mononuclear cells are cultured for prolonged periods of time in the presence of RANTES, CCR5 expression is comparable to that seen on cells treated with control medium, whereas there is no CCR5 surface expression on cells cultured in the presence of AOP-RANTES. Immunofluorescence indicated that both AOP-RANTES and RANTES induced downmodulation of cell surface CCR5, and that the receptor was redistributed into endocytic organelles containing the transferrin receptor. When RANTES was removed, the internalized receptor was recycled to the cell surface; however, the receptor internalized in the presence of AOP-RANTES was retained in endosomes. Using human osteosarcoma (GHOST) 34/CCR5 cells, the potency of AOP-RANTES and RANTES to inhibit infection by the M-tropic HIV-1 strain, SF 162, correlated with the degree of downregulation of CCR5 induced by the two chemokines. These differences between AOP-RANTES and RANTES in their effect on receptor downregulation and recycling suggest a mechanism for the potent inhibition of HIV infection by AOP-RANTES. Moreover, these results support the notion that receptor internalization and inhibition of receptor recycling present new targets for therapeutic agents to prevent HIV infection.

15280474|a|We identified a novel spirodiketopiperazine (SDP) derivative, AK602/ONO4128/GW873140, which specifically blocked the binding of macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha) to CCR5 with a high affinity (K(d) of approximately 3 nM), potently blocked human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120/CCR5 binding and exerted potent activity against a wide spectrum of laboratory and primary R5 HIV-1 isolates, including multidrug-resistant HIV-1 (HIV-1(MDR)) (50% inhibitory concentration values of 0.1 to 0.6 nM) in vitro. AK602 competitively blocked the binding to CCR5 expressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells of two monoclonal antibodies, 45523, directed against multidomain epitopes of CCR5, and 45531, specific against the C-terminal half of the second extracellular loop (ECL2B) of CCR5. AK602, despite its much greater anti-HIV-1 activity than other previously published CCR5 inhibitors, including TAK-779 and SCH-C, preserved RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted) and MIP-1beta binding to CCR5(+) cells and their functions, including CC-chemokine-induced chemotaxis and CCR5 internalization, while TAK-779 and SCH-C fully blocked the CC-chemokine/CCR5 interactions.

11454872|a|Novel low molecular weight spirodiketopiperazine derivatives which potently inhibit R5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection through their antagonistic effects on CCR5 were identified. One such compound E913 (M(r) 484) specifically blocked the binding of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) to CCR5 (IC(50) 0.002 microm) and MIP-1alpha-elicited cellular Ca(2+) mobilization (IC(50) approximately 0.02 microm). E913 potently inhibited the replication of laboratory and primary R5 HIV-1 strains as well as various multidrug-resistant monocyte/macrophage tropic (R5) HIV-1 at IC(50) values of 0.03 to 0.06 microm. E913 was inactive against T cell tropic (X4) HIV-1; however, when combined with a CXCR4 antagonist AMD-3100, E913 potently and synergistically inhibited the replication of dualtropic HIV-1 and a 50:50 mixture of R5 and X4 HIV-1. Antagonism in anti-HIV-1 activity was not seen when E913 was combined with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor zidovudine or protease inhibitors. E913 proved to compete with the binding of antibodies to CCR5 which recognize the C-terminal half of the second extracellular loop (ECL2B) of CCR5. E913 and its analogs are acid-resistant and orally bioavailable in rodents. These data warrant that spirodiketopiperazine derivatives be further developed as potential therapeutics for HIV-1 infection.

12951808|a|The development of mechanistic insight into the process by which HIV enters host cells has revealed a panoply of targets that offer considerable potential as sites for pharmacological intervention. The gp120/gp41 protein complex, expressed on the virion surface, mediates HIV entry by a process initiated by the engagement of the host cell receptor CD4. Subtle conformational changes triggered by this interaction expose elements of gp120 to the seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 expressed on host cells, a contact that relieves constraints imposed on gp41 by gp120. This leads to a major conformational rearrangement of gp41, which results in the insertion of the fusion peptide into the host cell membrane and the assembly of the amino terminus heptad repeat into a trimeric form that is subsequently recognized by the carboxy terminal heptad repeat. The latter process leads to juxtaposition of the viral and host cell membranes, a prelude to fusion. The most prominent strategies and targets that are actively being exploited as drug discovery opportunities are inhibition of the attachment of HIV to host cells, blockade of chemokine receptors and interference with the function of gp41. Inhibitors of each of these steps in the HIV entry process with potential clinical relevance are reviewed in the context of their status in the drug development process. The most significant entity to emerge from this area of research to date is enfuvirtide, a 36-amino acid derivative that interferes with the function of gp41. Enfuvirtide is the first HIV entry inhibitor to be granted a license for marketing (it was approved in the US and Europe in March 2003), and its introduction portends the beginning of what promises to be an exciting new era of HIV therapy.

10196243|a|The natural ligands for the CCR5 chemokine receptor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, and RANTES (regulated on T-cell activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), are known to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry, and N-terminally modified RANTES analogues are more potent than native RANTES in blocking infection. However, potent CCR5 blocking agents may select for HIV-1 variants that use alternative coreceptors at less than fully inhibitory concentrations. In this study, two N-terminal chemical modifications of RANTES produced by total synthesis, aminooxypentane (AOP)-RANTES[2-68] and N-nonanoyl (NNY)-RANTES[2-68], were tested for their ability to prevent HIV-1 infection and to select for coreceptor switch variants in the human peripheral blood lymphocyte-SCID mouse model. Mice were infected with a CCR5-using HIV-1 isolate that requires only one or two amino acid substitutions to use CXCR4 as a coreceptor. Even though it achieved lower circulating concentrations than AOP-RANTES (75 to 96 pM as opposed to 460 pM under our experimental conditions), NNY-RANTES was more effective in preventing HIV-1 infection. However, in a subset of treated mice, these levels of NNY-RANTES rapidly selected viruses with mutations in the V3 loop of envelope that altered coreceptor usage. These results reinforce the case for using agents that block all significant HIV-1 coreceptors for effective therapy.

We investigated the effects of a number of naturally occurring chemokines (MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4) on different processes linked to the chemokine receptor CCR5 in recombinant CHO cells expressing the receptor at different levels. 2. Internalization of CCR5 following chemokine treatment was studied and MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and RANTES (50 nM) were able to induce internalization (similar50%) of the receptor. Internalization due to MCP-2, MCP-3 and MCP-4 was less (similar20%). 3. Phosphorylation of CCR5 following chemokine treatment was studied and MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and RANTES (50 nM) were able to induce phosphorylation of CCR5 whereas the other chemokines did not induce CCR5 phosphorylation. 4. MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES and MCP-2 were able to stimulate [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding, an index of receptor/G protein activation, whereas MCP-3 and MCP-4 had no effect in this assay. MCP-2 was a partial agonist (similar80%) compared to MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and RANTES, which gave similar maximal stimulations in this assay. 5. MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES, MCP-2 and MCP-4 were able to stimulate increases in intracellular calcium ions via activation of CCR5 whereas MCP-3 was without effect. 6. It is concluded that different chemokines interacting with CCR5 mediate different patterns of cellular responses.

10606632|a|Antigen-specific T helper cells present in peripheral blood at very low frequencies are capable of rapid clonal expansion during antigenic challenge. The exquisite specificity of this response provides for activation and expansion of a very select cohort of T cells, a feature we have used to directly identify and quantify human epitope-specific T helper cells from peripheral blood. Soluble tetramerized class II MHC molecules, loaded with an immunodominant peptide from hemagglutinin (HA) and labeled with fluorescent dyes, were constructed and used to directly identify antigen-specific T cells from influenza-immune individuals. After 7 days of proliferation in response to stimulation by HA peptide or whole influenza vaccine, cells staining positive with the HA tetramer had undergone between 6 and 9 divisions and were CD3(+), CD4(+), CD25(+), and CD8(-), characteristic of activated T helper cells responding to antigen. The HA epitope-specific component of the complex response to whole influenza vaccine represented a major subset of proliferating T helper cells. Soluble class II tetramers allow a direct approach for the analysis of immunodominant antigenic specificities. The identification of antigen-specific T helper cells in the peripheral blood provides a means for tracking the immune response against infectious agents and in autoimmune disease.

11138790|a|The pivotal discovery that two chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, serve along with the T-cell receptor-interacting CD4 molecule as the principal co-receptors for HIV-1 entry stimulated a search for common genetic polymorphism in their genes which might affect the course of AIDS. Four mutational variants, CCR5-delta32, CCR5-P1, CCR2-641 and SDF1-3'A were discovered to play a regulatory role in HIV-1 infection, in the rate of progression to AIDS or both. Plausible physiological mechanisms to explain the population genetic association by these alleles have been advanced and are discussed critically here. Genetic ablation of AIDS progression by chemokine receptor and ligand gene variants has catalyzed development of novel therapies targeting the virus-co-receptor interaction. The functional and therapeutic implications of these AIDS restriction genes for disease progression and intervention are explored in this review.

12210401|a|The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are an obvious target for HIV therapies. Two compounds, T-22 and AMD-3100, have been shown to inhibit infection of CXCR4-using HIV-1 isolates. The specificity of T-22 and AMD-3100 was further confirmed by their ability to block entry of HIV-1 in GHOST-CXCR4 transfected cells with no effect on viral entry in the GHOST-CCR5 cells. The ability of T-22 to block replication of diverse HIV-1 isolates (group M, subtypes A, B, D, E, and F as well as group O) and HIV-2 primary isolates with varying coreceptor specificities ranging from exclusive CCR5 usage to multiple coreceptor usage was examined in detail. T-22 was found to be highly effective (>90%) at blocking infection of diverse HIV-1 (subtypes A-F, and group O) and HIV-2 isolates that use multiple coreceptors in human PBMCs homozygous for a 32-bp deletion in CCR5 (CCR5-/-), but less effective in CCR5 +/+ PBMCs. Additionally, sequential primary HIV-1 isolates obtained from a longitudinal cohort who had switched from single coreceptor usage to a broad range of multiple receptors could be blocked effectively by both T-22 and AMD-3100 in CCR5-/- PBMCs. Our data suggest that CXCR4 antagonistic compounds are highly effective in blocking the entry of X4-tropic HIV-1, and that these compounds could be a useful additive to current anti-retroviral therapy for clinical management of HIV disease.

14742192|a|Wild-type viruses from the ViroLogic phenotype-genotype database were evaluated to determine the upper confidence limit of the drug susceptibility distributions, or "biological cutoffs," for the PhenoSense HIV phenotypic drug susceptibility assay. Definition of the natural variation in drug susceptibility in wild-type human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 isolates is necessary to determine the prevalence of innate drug resistance and to assess the capability of the PhenoSense assay to reliably measure subtle reductions in drug susceptibility. The biological cutoffs for each drug, defined by the 99th percentile of the fold change in the 50% inhibitory concentration distributions or the mean fold change plus 2 standard deviations, were lower than those previously reported for other phenotypic assays and lower than the clinically relevant cutoffs previously defined for the PhenoSense assay. The 99th percentile fold change values ranged from 1.2 (tenofovir) to 1.8 (zidovudine) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase RT inhibitors (RTIs), from 3.0 (efavirenz) to 6.2 (delavirdine) for nonnucleoside RTIs, and from 1.6 (lopinavir) to 3.6 (nelfinavir) for protease inhibitors. To evaluate the potential role of intrinsic assay variability in the observed variations in the drug susceptibilities of wild-type isolates, 10 reference viruses with different drug susceptibility patterns were tested 8 to 30 times each. The median coefficients of variation in fold change for the reference viruses ranged from 12 to 18% for all drugs except zidovudine (32%), strongly suggesting that the observed differences in wild-type virus susceptibility to the different drugs is related to intrinsic virus variability rather than assay variability. The low biological cutoffs and assay variability suggest that the PhenoSense HIV assay may assist in defining clinically relevant susceptibility cutoffs for resistance to antiretroviral drugs.

11091193|a|The chemokine receptor CCR5 is an important co-receptor for cell fusion. A 32-bp deletion of the CCR5 gene, leading to complete absence of functional CCR5 expression, has been associated with resistance to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in homozygotes and slower HIV disease progression in heterozygotes. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of this 32-bp deletion on transmission of HIV infection and on HIV disease progression in haemophilic individuals. Six HIV-negative patients from our centre, known to have been exposed to infectious factor VIII concentrates, have been analysed. Three of these patients possess the CCR5 32-bp deletion, two patients being homozygous. The presence of the CCR5 32-bp gene deletion has also been analysed in 71 HIV-positive patients. In this group of patients, there was a lower than expected incidence of the 32-bp deletion. Those who possess the 32-bp deletion progress to AIDS more slowly than those who do not (P = 0.05, log-rank test). Rates of CD4 loss were slower in those heterozygous for the gene deletion. We confirm that heterozygosity for the 32-bp gene deletion in CCR5 is partially protective against initial infection with HIV. In those heterozygous patients who became infected with HIV, disease progression was slower.

12496074|a|The G-protein coupled receptor CCR5 is the main co-receptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains. I have built a structural model of the chemokine receptor CCR5 and used it to explain the binding and selectivity of the antagonist TAK779. Models of the extracellular (EC) domains of CCR5 have been constructed and used to rationalize current biological data on the binding of HIV-1 and chemokines. Residues spanning the transmembrane region of CCR5 have been modeled after rhodopsin, and their functional significance examined using the evolutionary trace method. The receptor cavity shares six residues with CC-chemokine receptors CCR1 through CCR4, while seven residues are unique to CCR5. The contribution of these residues to ligand binding and selectivity is tested by molecular docking simulations of TAK779 to CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5. TAK779 binds to CCR5 in the cavity formed by helices 1, 2, 3, and 7 with additional interactions with helices 5 and 6. TAK779 did not dock to either CCR1 or CCR2. The results are consistent with current site-directed mutagenesis data and with the observed selectivity of TAK779 for CCR5 over CCR1 and CCR2. The specific residues responsible for the observed selectivity are identified. The four EC regions of CCR5 have been modeled using constrained simulated annealing simulations. Applied dihedral angle constraints are representative of the secondary structure propensities of these regions. Tertiary interactions, in the form of distance constraints, are generated from available epitope mapping data. Analysis of the 250 simulated structures provides new insights to the design of experiments aimed at determining residue-residue contacts across the EC domains and for mapping CC-chemokines on the surface of the EC domains.

12505029|a|HIV-1 comprises three groups, the main (M group), O (outlier) and N (non-M, non-O). The M group, divided into 11 subtypes, is responsible for the global HIV-1 pandemic. Recombination between M subtypes has resulted in the generation of multiple circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) consisting of mosaic lineages. Most subtypes and CRFs are represented in Africa, whereas predominance of one or a few subtypes was reported initially elsewhere. This finding reflects the African origin of the epidemic. In western countries, where the B subtype is predominant, there is a steep increase in non B-subtypes and CRFs, while new recombinants emerge worldwide. Travellers contribute to the spread of HIV-1 genetic diversity worldwide, and in the developing world migration of rural populations and civil war are additional contributing factors. The spreading of HIV-1 variants has implications for diagnostic, treatment, and vaccine development.

2088205|a|Nearly four generations of investigators have studied combined drug effects. Their methods of generating and analyzing data have changed dramatically over the years but the basic problem has not. This review examines the inherent difficulties in analyzing combined drug effects and evaluates modern methods of describing these interactions. Researchers have traditionally used two-dimensional (2-D) methods to approximate the actual three-dimensional (3-D) nature of drug interactions. We conclude that these 2-D methods are often inadequate when used to analyze synergistic and antagonistic drug interactions in antiviral and anticancer chemotherapy. We propose a direct and pragmatic 3-D approach to the problem, made possible by microcomputers and sophisticated graphics programs. This procedure directly elucidates the shape of the dose-response surface, identifies the regions of statistically significant synergy and antagonism, and quantitates these effects. It also greatly simplifies the problem since a 3-D surface presents complete drug interactions in a way that can be easily interpreted. We will show that understanding the shape of the resulting 3-D surface is essential to an understanding of complex drug interactions. This new method facilitates the rigorous analysis of drug-drug interactions and offers investigators powerful new tools to analyze combinations of antiviral and anticancer drugs.

12644702|a|A recombinant virus assay was used to characterize in detail neutralizing antibody responses directed at circulating autologous HIV in plasma. Examining serial plasma specimens in a matrix format, most patients with primary HIV infection rapidly generated significant neutralizing antibody responses to early (0-39 months) autologous viruses, whereas responses to laboratory and heterologous primary strains were often lower and delayed. Plasma virus continually and rapidly evolved to escape neutralization, indicating that neutralizing antibody exerts a level of selective pressure that has been underappreciated based on earlier, less comprehensive characterizations. These data argue that neutralizing antibody responses account for the extensive variation in the envelope gene that is observed in the early months after primary HIV infection.

8751444|a|HIV-1 and related viruses require co-receptors, in addition to CD4, to infect target cells. The chemokine receptor CCR-5 (ref.1) was recently demonstrated to be a co-receptor for macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains, and the orphan receptor LESTR (also called fusin) allows infection by strains adapted for growth in transformed T-cell lines (T-tropic strains). Here we show that a mutant allele of CCR-5 is present at a high frequency in caucasian populations (allele frequency, 0.092), but is absent in black populations from Western and Central Africa and Japanese populations. A 32-base-pair deletion within the coding region results in a frame shift, and generates a non-functional receptor that does not support membrane fusion or infection by macrophage- and dual-tropic HIV-1 strains. In a cohort of HIV-1 infected caucasian subjects, no individual homozygous for the mutation was found, and the frequency of heterozygotes was 35% lower than in the general population. White blood cells from an individual homozygous for the null allele were found to be highly resistant to infection by M-tropic HIV-1 viruses, confirming that CCR-5 is the major co-receptor for primary HIV-1 strains. The lower frequency of heterozygotes in seropositive patients may indicate partial resistance.

12420752|a|HIV entry within the cell involves the presence of at least two chemokine co-receptors, the CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors. Viral entry can be inhibited by the natural ligands for CXCR4, the CXC chemokine SDF-1 and CCR5, the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta, respectively. Much research has been devoted ultimately to the development of small molecule chemokine antagonists that inhibit virus entry within the cell, and constitute in this way novel antiviral medications. The most potent and specific CXCR4 antagonists reported up to now are the bicyclam derivatives, which also potently block X4 HIV replication. One such compound, AMD3100 has proved to be a highly specific CXCR4 antagonist, which consistently blocks the outgrowth of all X4 HIV and dual-tropic (R5/X4) variants that use CXCR4 for entering the cells. From such bicyclam analogues, AMD3100 was selected as the clinical candidate, which, after initial Phase I studies, proceeded to Phase II trials, but unfortunately showed significant cardiac side effects which lead to its withdrawal from further development. The first nonpeptidic compound that interacts with CCR5, but not with CXCR4, is a quaternary ammonium derivative, TAK-779, which also shows potent but variable anti-HIV activity. A large number of potent CCR5 antagonists from several classes of polycyclic derivatives have been recently disclosed. Many such derivatives showed nanomolar binding affinity to the receptor, and at least one of them, the oxime-piperidine derivative SCH-351125 has progressed to clinical evaluation. The development of such agents for clinical use may constitute an additional approach for the treatment of HIV infection, in addition to the classical one involving reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors.

15279544|a|Combination therapy with reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors greatly reduces morbidity and mortality in HIV-1-infected individuals. However, current anti-retroviral treatment cannot eradicate the virus from infected individuals and is often limited by the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains and long-term toxicity. These problems emphasize the need to develop new anti-HIV-1 drugs targeting different steps in the viral replication cycle. HIV-1 entry into host cells represents a complex sequence of events involving several viral and cellular proteins that are potential drug targets. In particular, HIV-1 entry requires a sequential interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 with CD4 and a co-receptor on the host cell plasma membrane. The CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and the CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) are the primary HIV-1 co-receptors in vivo, and are attractive targets for the development of new anti-HIV-1 drugs. CCR5 and CXCR4 belong to the protein superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Many orally bioavailable small-molecules interact with specific GPCRs and many existing drugs are orally bioavailable small-molecule agonists or antagonists of GPCRs. Several small-molecule antagonists of CCR5 and CXCR4 that block chemokine binding and HIV-1 entry have been identified in recent years and are now in pre-clinical or clinical development as drug candidates. This review discusses structural and functional aspects of these compounds and summarizes recent insights into how small-molecule antagonists interact with CCR5 and CXCR4, focusing on drug development programs that are well documented in the scientific literature.

11606733|a|We describe here the identification and properties of SCH-C (SCH 351125), a small molecule inhibitor of HIV-1 entry via the CCR5 coreceptor. SCH-C, an oxime-piperidine compound, is a specific CCR5 antagonist as determined in multiple receptor binding and signal transduction assays. This compound specifically inhibits HIV-1 infection mediated by CCR5 in U-87 astroglioma cells but has no effect on infection of CXCR4-expressing cells. SCH-C has broad and potent antiviral activity in vitro against primary HIV-1 isolates that use CCR5 as their entry coreceptor, with mean 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging between 0.4 and 9 nM. Moreover, SCH-C strongly inhibits the replication of an R5-using HIV-1 isolate in SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice. SCH-C has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in rodents and primates with an oral bioavailability of 50-60% and a serum half-life of 5-6 h. On the basis of its novel mechanism of action, potent antiviral activity, and in vivo pharmacokinetic profile, SCH-C is a promising new candidate for therapeutic intervention of HIV infection.

8564263|a|1 The ability of various prostaglandins (PGs) to inhibit monocyte chemotaxis induced by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was investigated with a human monocytic leukaemia cell line, THP-1. Moreover, to investigate the mechanism of the inhibitory action of PGs the involvement of either intracellular adenosine 3': 5'-cyclic monosphosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation or intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was studied. 2 TEI-6122, a synthetic 7-thia-PGE1 derivative, inhibited chemotaxis of THP-1 cells induced by MCP-1 with an IC50 of 1.5 pM. Its inhibitory activity was 1000 fold more than that of PGE1 and PGE2 (IC50 = 2.8 nM and 0.9 nM, respectively), which were more potent than other PGs such as PGA1, PGA2, PGF2 alpha and PGI2 (IC50 > or = 1 microM). 3 With respect to the effect on intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation in THP-1 cells, TEI-6122 was as potent as PGE1 and PGE2, which were approximately 100 to 1000 fold more potent than the other PGs such as PGA1, PGA2 and PGI2. The minimum concentration of TEI-6122 required to increase intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation in THP-1 cells was 1 nM. 4 TEI-6122 and PGE1 (4 microM) transiently increased intracellular calcium levels in THP-1 cells. When added prior to MCP-1, both PGs partially suppressed the increased in Ca2+ caused by this cytokine. There were no significant differences between the activity of TEI-6122 and PGE1 in either respect. 5 It is concluded that TEI-6122, a synthetic 7-thia-PGE1 derivative is a much more potent inhibitor of MCP-1-induced THP-1 cell chemotaxis than PGEI and PGE2 which are the best inhibitors among the natural PGs tested, while neither intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation nor effects on Ca2+ mobilization account for the extremely potent inhibitory activity of TEI-6122. Thus, either a novel PGE2 receptor (EPreceptor) or a novel intracellular signal transduction system may be involved in the extremely potent chemotaxis inhibitory activity of TEI-6122.

10737431|a|A homozygous 32-bp deletion in the gene encoding CCR5, a major coreceptor for HIV-1, leads to resistance to infection with HIV-1, and heterozygosity for the deletion is associated with delayed disease progression in persons infected with HIV-1. We investigated the effect of CCR5 heterozygosity on disease progression as measured by both CD4+ T-cell count decline and the occurrence of clinical AIDS symptoms. Using a unified statistical model for CD4 count progression and AIDS development, we examined whether the effect of CCR5 heterozygosity on clinical AIDS is direct or indirect through its effect on CD4 counts. Based on data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, we noted a protective effect of CCR5 heterozygosity on both CD4 cell count progression and on AIDS occurrence. Furthermore, we found that this protective effect on the occurrence of AIDS was completely mediated through an effect on the CD4 marker. Additional adjustment for the effect of an initial viral load measurement indicate that CCR5 heterozygosity did not have predictive value for either CD4 progression or the development of AIDS beyond its association with early viral load.

11782552|a|To study HIV-1 escape from a coreceptor antagonist, the R5 primary isolate CC1/85 was passaged in peripheral blood mononuclear cells with increasing concentrations of the CCR5-specific small molecule inhibitor, AD101. By 19 passages, an escape mutant emerged with a >20,000-fold resistance to AD101. This virus was cross-resistant to a related inhibitor, SCH-C, and partially resistant to RANTES but still sensitive to CCR5-specific mAbs. The resistant phenotype was stable; the mutant virus retained AD101 resistance during nine additional passages of culture in the absence of inhibitor. Replication of the escape mutant in peripheral blood mononuclear cells completely depended on CCR5 expression and did not occur in cells from CCR5-Delta32 homozygous individuals. The escape mutant was unable to use CXCR4 or any other tested coreceptor to enter transfected cells. Acquisition of CXCR4 use is not the dominant in vitro escape pathway for a small molecule CCR5 entry inhibitor. Instead, HIV-1 acquires the ability to use CCR5 despite the inhibitor, first by requiring lower levels of CCR5 for entry and then probably by using the drug-bound form of the receptor.

9687537|a|Hemofiltrate C-C chemokine (HCC)-1 is a recently cloned C-C chemokine that is structurally similar to macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha. Unlike most chemokines, it is constitutively secreted by tissues and is present at high concentrations in normal human plasma. Also atypical for chemokines, HCC-1 is reported not to be chemotactic for leukocytes. In this paper, we have investigated the chemokine receptor usage and downstream signaling pathways of HCC-1. Cross-desensitization experiments using THP-1 cells suggested that HCC-1 and MIP-1alpha activated the same receptor. Experiments using a panel of cloned chemokine receptors revealed that HCC-1 specifically activated C-C chemokine receptor (CCR)1, but not closely related receptors, including CCR5. HCC-1 competed with MIP-1alpha for binding to CCR1-transfected cells, but with a markedly reduced affinity (IC50 = 93 nM versus 1.3 nM for MIP-1alpha). Similarly, HCC-1 was less potent than MIP-1alpha in inducing inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in CCR1-transfected cells. HCC-1 induced chemotaxis of freshly isolated human monocytes, THP-1 cells, and CCR1-transfected cells, and the optimal concentration for cell migration (100 nM) was approximately 100-fold lower than that of MIP-1alpha (1 nM). These data demonstrate that HCC-1 is a chemoattractant and identify CCR1 as a functional HCC-1 receptor on human monocytes.

12065733|a|Several macrolides have been reported to cause QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. To clarify the underlying ionic mechanisms, we examined the effects of six macrolides on the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG)-encoded potassium current stably expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 cells. All six drugs showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the current with the following IC(50) values: clarithromycin, 32.9 microM; roxithromycin, 36.5 microM; erythromycin, 72.2 microM; josamycin, 102.4 microM; erythromycylamine, 273.9 microM; and oleandomycin, 339.6 microM. A metabolite of erythromycin, des-methyl erythromycin, was also found to inhibit HERG current with an IC(50) of 147.1 microM. These findings imply that the blockade of HERG may be a common feature of macrolides and may contribute to the QT prolongation observed clinically with some of these compounds. Mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of HERG current by clarithromycin did not require activation of the channel and was both voltage- and time-dependent. The blocking time course could be described by a first-order reaction between the drug and the channel. Both binding and unbinding processes appeared to speed up as the membrane was more depolarized, indicating that the drug-channel interaction may be affected by electrostatic responses.

In this article, the receptor-based mechanism of action of 873140 is compared with four other noncompetitive allosteric antagonists of CCR5. Although (Z)-(4-bromophenyl){1'-[(2,4-dimethyl-1-oxido-3-pyridinyl)carbonyl]-4'-methyl-1,4'-bipiperidin-4-yl}methanone O-ethyloxime (Sch-C; SCH 351125), 4,6-dimethyl-5-{[4-methyl-4-((3S)-3-methyl-4-{(1R)-2-(methyloxy)-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethyl}-1-piperazinyl)-1-piperidinyl]carbonyl}pyrimidine (Sch-D; SCH 417,690), 4,4-difluoro-N-((1S)-3-{(3-endo)-3-[3-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl]-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-8-yl}-1-phenyl-propyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (UK-427,857), and N,N-dimethyl-N-[4-[[[2-(4-methylphenyl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-benzocyclo-hepten-8-yl]carbonyl]amino]benzyl]tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-aminium chloride (TAK779) blocked the binding of both chemokines (125)I-MIP-1alpha (also known as (125)I-CCL3, (125)I-LD78) and (125)I-RANTES ((125)I-CCL5), 873140 was an ineffectual antagonist of (125)I-RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) binding (but did block binding of (125)I-MIP-1alpha). Furthermore, 873140 blocked the calcium response effects of CCR5 activation by CCL5 (RANTES) (as did the other antagonists), indicating a unique divergence of blockade of function and binding with this antagonist. The antagonism of CCR5 by 873140 is saturable and probe-dependent, consistent with an allosteric mechanism of action. The blockade of CCR5 by 873140 was extremely persistent with a rate constant for reversal of <0.004 h(-) (1) (t(1/2) > 136 h). Coadministration studies of 873140 with the four other allosteric antagonists yielded data that are consistent with the notion that all five of these antagonists bind to a common allosteric site on the CCR5 receptor. Although these ligands may have a common binding site, they do not exert the same allosteric effect on the receptor, as indicated by their differential effects on the binding of (125)I-RANTES. This idea is discussed in terms of using these drugs sequentially to overcome HIV viral resistance in the clinic.

9573309|a|An understanding of the mechanisms of virologic cross-resistance between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitors is important for the establishment of effective treatment strategies for patients who no longer respond to their initial protease inhibitor. Protease gene sequencing results from patients treated with saquinavir showed significant increases in the frequency of the G48V protease mutation in patients receiving higher doses of the drug. In addition, all six patients who developed the G48V mutation during saquinavir therapy developed the V82A mutation either on continued saquinavir or after a switch to nelfinavir or indinavir. In vitro susceptibility assays showed that all 13 isolates with reduced susceptibilities to two or more protease inhibitors had either the G48V or L90M mutation, along with an average of six other protease mutations. Reduced susceptibility to nelfinavir was found in 14 isolates, but only 1 possessed the D30N mutation. These results suggest that mutations selected in vivo by initial saquinavir therapy may provide more cross-resistance to the other protease inhibitors than has been previously reported.

10475184|a|Resistance of HIV-1 to antiretroviral drugs is the main cause of antiretroviral-treatment failure. We assessed the transmission of drug-resistant variants among individuals with primary HIV-1 infection.Population-based sequencing of the viral reverse-transcriptase and protease genes derived from plasma viral RNA was done in 82 consecutive individuals with documented primary HIV-1 infection from January, 1996, to July, 1998. Phenotypic resistance to protease inhibitors was assessed by recombinant virus assay in individuals with two or more mutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors.Zidovudine-resistance mutations were detected in seven (9%) of 82 individuals. Mutations associated with resistance to other reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) were detected in two individuals. Primary-resistance mutations associated with protease inhibitors (V82A, L90M) were detected in three (4%) of 70 individuals; two of these had also RTI-resistance mutations. Decreased sensitivity to three or four protease inhibitors was seen in three individuals, one of whom was infected with HIV-1 variants that harboured 12 mutations associated with resistance to multiple RTI and protease inhibitors.To introduce the best antiretroviral treatment, resistance testing should be done in recently HIV-1-infected individuals.

11698702|a|To assess the impact of primary HIV infection (PHI) on the spread of HIV and the temporal trends in transmission of HIV drug resistance between 1996 and 1999 in Switzerland.Sequencing of the genes for reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease was performed for 197 individuals with documented PHI. Phylogenetic analyses were confronted with epidemiological data.Significant clustering was demonstrated for 29% of the RT sequences. All these cases occurred closely together in place and time; contact tracing demonstrated transmission at the time of PHI in 30% of them. Genotypic drug resistance was detected in 8.6% of PHI individuals in 1996, 14.6% in 1997, 8.8% in 1998 and 5.0% in 1999. Drug-resistant variants were identified in 11.3% of individuals infected by homosexual contacts, 6.1% by heterosexual contacts, 13% of intravenous drug users and more frequently in men (10.4%) than women (2.6%). Potential factors involved in the recent decrease of transmission of drug-resistant variants include increase of HIV non-B subtypes from 23% in 1996 to 35% in 1999 (only one non-B subtype had resistance mutations) and a steady increase of patients with undetectable viraemia as documented in Swiss HIV Cohort Study (10% in 1996 vs 53% in 1999).Phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses underline the impact of PHI in the spread of HIV. Moreover, this study indicates that drug resistance transmission may have decreased recently in Switzerland through the increased frequency of infection with HIV non-B subtypes and the steady increase of patients with undetectable viraemia.

10888629|a|We have used coreceptor-targeted inhibitors to investigate which coreceptors are used by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) to enter peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The inhibitors are TAK-779, which is specific for CCR5 and CCR2, aminooxypentane-RANTES, which blocks entry via CCR5 and CCR3, and AMD3100, which targets CXCR4. We found that for all the HIV-1 isolates and all but one of the HIV-2 isolates tested, the only relevant coreceptors were CCR5 and CXCR4. However, one HIV-2 isolate replicated in human PBMC even in the presence of TAK-779 and AMD3100, suggesting that it might use an undefined, alternative coreceptor that is expressed in the cells of some individuals. SIV(mac)239 and SIV(mac)251 (from macaques) were also able to use an alternative coreceptor to enter PBMC from some, but not all, human and macaque donors. The replication in human PBMC of SIV(rcm) (from a red-capped mangabey), a virus which uses CCR2 but not CCR5 for entry, was blocked by TAK-779, suggesting that CCR2 is indeed the paramount coreceptor for this virus in primary cells.

9558111|a|The CC-chemokine receptor CCR5 has been shown to be the major coreceptor for HIV-1 entry into cells, and humans with homozygous mutation in the ccr5 gene are highly resistant to HIV-1 infection, despite the existence of many other HIV-1 coreceptors. To investigate the physiologic function of CCR5 and to understand the cellular mechanisms of these clinical observations, we generated a CCR5-deficient mouse model (ccr5[-/-]) by targeted deletion of the ccr5 gene. We found that although developed normally in a pathogen-free environment, CCR5-deficient mice showed reduced efficiency in clearance of Listeria infection and exert a protective effect against LPS-induced endotoxemia, reflecting a partial defect in macrophage function. In addition, CCR5-deficient mice had an enhanced delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and increased humoral responses to T cell-dependent antigenic challenge, indicating a novel role of CCR5 in down-modulating T cell-dependent immune response.

9328494|a|The aim was to examine the longitudinal evolution of depression and anosognosia in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD).Sixty-two of a consecutive series of 116 AD patients that were examined with a structured psychiatric interview had a follow-up evaluation between one and two years after the initial evaluation.At the initial evaluation 19% of the 62 patients had major depression, 34% had dysthymia, and 47% were not depressed. After a mean follow-up of 16 months, 58% of patients with major depression at the initial evaluation were still depressed, whereas only 28% of patients with initial dysthymia and 21% of the non-depressed patients were depressed at follow-up. During the follow-up period, all three groups showed similar declines in cognitive status and activities of daily living. At the initial evaluation, 39% of the patients had anosognosia, and there was a significant increment of anosognosia during the follow-up period.While dysthymia in AD is a brief emotional disorder, major depression is a longer-lasting mood change. Anosognosia is another prevalent disorder among AD patients, and increases with the progression of the illness.

8727167|a|This study examined the relation between awareness of memory and functional decline and cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Twenty-six patients with early AD and 16 nondemented elderly controls were studied. Awareness of deficits was determined by using (a) a discrepancy score between subject's and caregiver's ratings on a memory questionnaire, (b) a discrepancy score between subject's and caregiver's ratings on an activities-of-daily-living scale, and (c) a clinical rating of dementia awareness for patients. Whereas self-ratings of memory and activities of daily living were not significantly different between AD patients and controls, these two measures differed significantly when AD patients' ratings were compared with those of their caregivers. Measures of awareness of deficits correlated with one another and were primarily associated with performance on tests of executive and visuospatial functions but not with depression. Early AD is characterized by a failure of self-monitoring. Deficits in self-monitoring have been proposed to occur after damage to the frontal lobes and other cerebral areas. Impaired awareness of memory and functional deficits in AD is related to cognitive impairments, which may involve frontal and right hemisphere connections.

15169616|a|This review considers the concepts and models that, often implicitly, underlie accounts and studies of variations in awareness of difficulties in people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to do this, it is necessary to draw on explanations presented within the discourses of different disciplines. The review aims to explore the key tensions and debates that arise in attempting to conceptualize awareness, and attempts to specify what kind of conceptual framework is needed in order to advance our understanding of variations in awareness in AD.A range of literature relating to concepts and models of awareness, drawn from different disciplines and published during the past 30 years, is critically reviewed.The literatures of different disciplines present varying constructions of the concept of awareness. Neuropsychological, psychiatric and psychosocial explanations are considered and their relevance to understanding awareness in early-stage AD is discussed.An understanding of variations in awareness in early-stage AD requires a biopsychosocial model of awareness that incorporates the influence of both neuropsychological impairments and psychosocial responses. Improved understanding of variations in awareness is essential for the development of person-centred approaches to intervention and care in AD.

15169617|a|This review has three main aims: (1) To illustrate the strengths and limitations of current approaches to assessing awareness of difficulties and impairments in people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). (2) To consider the evidence regarding factors associated with level of awareness. (3) To highlight the implications for assessment and intervention.A comprehensive range of literature on awareness in AD published in the past 20 years is critically reviewed.Four main approaches to the assessment of awareness can be discerned, each with significant conceptual and methodological limitations. These limitations affect the quality of the available evidence regarding factors associated with level of awareness, which is contradictory, with few clear findings emerging. Awareness does, however, appear to be related to the outcome of rehabilitation, and this has important implications for the selection of appropriate and sensitive interventions.The review highlights the need for a broad conceptualization of awareness. Greater clarity about theoretical frameworks, and improved assessment methods, are required in order to enhance understanding of variations in awareness in early-stage AD. Awareness is an important variable for clinicians to consider.

10097772|a|Lack of insight or impaired awareness of deficits in patients with dementia is a relatively neglected area of study. The aim of this study was to evaluate insight in a group of demented patients with two assessment scales and to assess their relationship with the cognitive level of disease severity. Sixty-nine consecutive patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (n = 37) and vascular dementia (n = 32) with a wide range of cognitive impairment (MMSE = 17.0 +/- 6.4) were recruited. Insight was evaluated with the Guidelines for the Rating of Awareness Deficits (GRAD)--specifically targeted to memory deficits--and the Clinical Insight Rating scale (CIR), evaluating a broader spectrum of insight (reason for the visit, cognitive deficits, functional deficits, and perception of the progression of the disease). In the whole sample, GRAD and CIR were significantly associated with MMSE (Spearman's coefficient = .51, p < .001; and r = -.55, p < .001) and with Clinical Dementia Rating scale (-.57, p < .001; and r = .57, p < .001) respectively. The shape of the relationship of MMSE with CIR and GRAD scales was assessed with spline smoothers suggesting that the relationship follows a trilinear pattern and is similar for both scales. Insight was uniformly high for MMSE scores > or = 24, showed a linear decrease between MMSE scores of 23 and 13, and was uniformly low for MMSE scores < or = 12. The trilinear model of the association between insight and cognitive status reflects more closely the observable decline of insight and can provide estimates of when the decline of insight begins and ends.

9046701|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show varying degrees of awareness of their deficits. To examine the impact of this phenomenon upon the distress experienced by family caregivers of AD patients, we analyzed caregiver burden in relation to patient awareness of deficit in three different functional domains. The relationship of burden to selected sociodemographic variables was also explored. Results of multiple regression analyses suggested that caregiver burden was associated with impaired patient awareness of memory deficit independent of disease stage and dementia severity. The findings suggest that impaired awareness may be an important mediator of caregiver burden, a concern in the management of AD.

8491848|a|Awareness of memory loss was rated in 57 patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, and analyzed in relation to neuropsychological tests and presence of depression. Single photon emission computed tomography measures of regional cerebral blood flow were obtained on an unselected subsample of 20. Anosognosia was associated with diminished relative right dorsolateral frontal lobe perfusion and with high rates of false positive errors on recognition memory testing. Less aware patients did not differ from others on learning or recall scores, or on dementia severity as measured by mental status scores. Neither anosognosia nor depression was associated with disease duration or dementia severity and patients who were aware of their memory loss were no more likely than others to be depressed. This is further evidence that dementia severity alone does not account for anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease; frontal lobe involvement and the presence of specific memory impairments may be important determining factors.

7995303|a|We examined the relationship between unawareness of cognitive deficits and psychiatric and neuropsychological manifestations in 181 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients unaware of their cognitive deficits were more cognitively impaired, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, and had a specific defect in 'frontal/executive' functions. The presence of major depression, delusions and hallucinations was no more likely among patients who were aware of their cognitive impairment than among those who were not. These findings have important implications for the understanding of anosognosia and deficit awareness in dementia.

9305497|a|The objective of this study was to determine whether unawareness of cognitive deficit is disease-specific. One hundred thirty-two patients were studied, grouped according to diagnosis of definite or probable Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, geropsychiatric control, or geriatric control. Diagnosis was the independent variable, and unawareness of cognitive deficit was the dependent variable. The Mini-Mental State Examination score was used as a dementia severity covariate. Analysis of covariance was significant (F = 8.0, p < 0.0001). Follow-up mean comparisons showed the Alzheimer disease group to have significantly greater unawareness of cognitive deficit than all other groups. The vascular dementia group had significantly greater unawareness of cognitive deficit than the two control groups. These results support the premise that, independent of dementia severity, unawareness of cognitive deficit is disease specific.

7746367|a|The relationship between anosognosia of memory deficit, intrusions and 'frontal' functions was investigated in 12 Alzheimer (DAT) patients, 12 depressed patients and 24 normal controls. DAT and depressed patients could not be dissociated according to the proportion of intrusion they produced in memory tasks. However, regardless of their clinical diagnosis, patients with anosognosia produced significantly more intrusions than patients without anosognosia, and anosognosia of memory deficit was positively and strongly correlated to the tendency to produce intrusions. By contrast, there was no correlation between intrusions, anosognosia and patients' performance on frontal tasks except for Verbal Fluency. Whereas anosognosia of memory deficit seems indispensable for intrusions, frontal dysfunction must not be considered a necessary condition for intrusions or anosognosia.

15728294|a|To develop a quantitative method of assessing cognitive anosognosia in six cognitive and two noncognitive domains.Control (n = 32) and probable Alzheimer disease (pAD) (n = 14) subjects self-estimated memory, attention, generative behavior, naming, visuospatial skill, limb praxis, mood, and uncorrected vision, both before and after these abilities were assessed. Based on this estimate and their performance the authors calculated an anosognosia ratio (AR) by dividing the difference between estimated and actual performance by an estimated and actual performance sum. With perfect awareness, AR = 0. Overestimating abilities would yield a positive AR (< or =1); underestimation would yield a negative AR (> or =-1).Relative to controls, pAD subjects demonstrated anosognosia. Pre-testing (off-line), pAD subjects overestimated their visuospatial skill; post-testing (on-line), pAD subjects overestimated their memory. Control subjects also made self-rating errors, underestimating their attention pre-testing and overestimating limb praxis and vision post-testing.This anosognosia assessment method may allow more detailed examination of distorted self-awareness. These results suggest that screening for anosognosia in probable Alzheimer disease (pAD) should include self-estimates of visuospatial function, and that, in pAD, it may be useful to assess anosognosia for amnesia both before and after memory testing.

An impaired insight score was developed by measuring discrepancies between patient report and caregiver report on standard instruments of activities of daily living. Insight was more impaired in subjects with greater dementia severity and subjects with paranoid delusions. In a multivariate analysis, the best neuropsychological predictors of impaired insight were the Continuous Performance Test and the Visual Reproduction Test. We speculate that the impaired insight of Alzheimer's disease has two components: confabulation reflecting prefrontal dysfunction and anosognosia reflecting right-hemisphere dysfunction.

Patients with anosognosia showed a significantly longer duration of illness, more severe cognitive impairments and deficits in activities of daily living, and higher mania and pathological laughing scores than AD patients without anosognosia. These findings suggest that anosognosia in AD may be part of a specific neuropsychiatric syndrome.

15198084|a|Impaired deficit awareness is important to detect because of its clinical implications; for example, patients with impaired awareness are more likely to engage in potentially dangerous activities, such as operating the stove. This study evaluated the reliability and validity of the Dementia Deficits Scale (DDS), a new multidimensional instrument for the assessment of self-awareness of cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits associated with dementia. Three parallel forms of the DDS were independently completed by the patient, clinician, and informant. The DDS yields two measures of deficit awareness: the discrepancy between clinician and patient assessments of the patient's deficits, and the discrepancy between informant and patient assessments. The DDS demonstrated adequate reliability and good divergent and convergent validity. Clinician and informant reports each added unique information, highlighting the importance of including both perspectives in the awareness assessment process. The DDS is recommended as a reliable and valid tool for the clinical and empirical assessment of deficit awareness in patients with dementia.

6610841|a|Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease include insidious onset and progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. There are no motor, sensory, or coordination deficits early in the disease. The diagnosis cannot be determined by laboratory tests. These tests are important primarily in identifying other possible causes of dementia that must be excluded before the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease may be made with confidence. Neuropsychological tests provide confirmatory evidence of the diagnosis of dementia and help to assess the course and response to therapy. The criteria proposed are intended to serve as a guide for the diagnosis of probable, possible, and definite Alzheimer's disease; these criteria will be revised as more definitive information become available.

1164215|a|Twenty-four patients of comparable age, blood pressure, and degree of dementia were classified by an "Ischemic Score" based on clinical features into "multi-infarct" and "primary degenerative" dementia. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by the intracarotid xenon 133 method. Both groups showed a decreased proportion of rapidly clearing brain tissue (largely gray matter). Cerebral blood flow per 100 gm brain per minute was normal in the primary degenerative group but low in the multi-infarct group. This suggests the blood flow is adequate for metabolic needs of the brain in patients with primary degenerative dementia but inadequate for those with multi-infarct dementia. There was no correlation between degree of dementia and CBF in the primary degenerative group but an inverse relationship existed in the multi-infarct group. Reactivity of blood vessels to reduction of arterial carbon dioxide pressure was normal in both groups.

The SCID is a semistructured interview for making the major Axis I DSM-III-R diagnoses. It is administered by a clinician and includes an introductory overview followed by nine modules, seven of which represent the major axis I diagnostic classes. Because of its modular construction, it can be adapted for use in studies in which particular diagnoses are not of interest. Using a decision tree approach, the SCID guides the clinician in testing diagnostic hypotheses as the interview is conducted. The output of the SCID is a record of the presence or absence of each of the disorders being considered, for current episode (past month) and for lifetime occurrence.

15536301|a|The phenomenology, main clinical correlates, and long-term evolution of disinhibition in dementia are not well known. To examine this issue, we studied a consecutive series of 272 patients with probable Alzheimer disease using a comprehensive psychiatric and neuropsychological evaluation that included the Disinhibition Scale. A subset of patients was reexamined with the same instruments between 1 and 4 years after the initial evaluation.A factor analysis of the Disinhibition Scale demonstrated 4 factors: (1) abnormal motor behavior, (2) hypomania, (3) loss of insight and egocentrism, and (4) poor self-care. Disinhibition was significantly associated with major and dysthymic depression, more severe negative symptoms, and loss of awareness. Most patients with disinhibition at the initial evaluation still showed disinhibition at follow-up, whereas 23% of patients without disinhibition at the initial evaluation developed disinhibition at follow-up.Disinhibition is a frequent and long-lasting problem in dementia. Our study demonstrates that the construct of disinhibition consists of 4 independent subsyndromes, each of which may have specific underlying mechanisms.

Apathy was significantly associated with more severe impairments in activities of daily living, significantly more severe extrapyramidal signs, and a significantly higher frequency of both major depression and dysthymia. Patients with irritability had significantly more severe impairments in activities of daily living and significantly higher depression and anosognosia scores. On the other hand, neither apathy nor irritability were significantly associated with deficits in specific cognitive domains.

Patients were examined with the Present State Exam and the Dementia-Psychosis Scale. Twenty-one patients (20%) met DSM-III-R criteria for a delusional disorder. The most frequent delusion type was paranoid (71%), followed by hypochondriacal (67%), the Capgras syndrome (29%), house misidentification (29%), and grandiose delusions (29%). Out of the 21 AD patients with delusions, 76% had three or more different types of delusions simultaneously. The frequency of delusions was not significantly associated with age, education, or age at dementia onset, and the type and severity of cognitive impairments was similar for AD patients with and without delusions. However, AD patients with delusions had significantly higher mania and anosognosia scores.

7802118|a|The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence, risk factors, and correlates of depression among patients with Alzheimer's disease.A consecutive series of 103 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were examined with a structured psychiatric interview and were assessed for the presence of cognitive impairments, deficits in activities of daily living, social functioning, and anosognosia.Fifty-one percent of the patients had depression (28% had dysthymia and 23% major depression). Women had a significantly higher prevalence of both major depression and dysthymia than men. Depressed and nondepressed patients had a similar frequency of family and personal histories of depression, a similar frequency of personality disorders before the onset of depression, and no significant differences in cognitive deficits and impairment in activities of daily living. Dysthymia usually started after the onset of dementia and was significantly more prevalent in the early stages of dementia; patients with dysthymia had a significantly better awareness of intellectual deficits than patients with major or no depression. On the other hand, patients with major depression had an earlier onset of depression (half of them before the onset of dementia), and the prevalence of major depression was similar across the different stages of the illness.This study demonstrates a high prevalence of dysthymia and major depression among patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. While dysthymia may be an emotional reaction to the progressive cognitive decline, major depression may be related to biological factors.

16295108|a|A 36-item-version of the Token Test is described and normative data obtained from its administration to 215 normal subjects are given. Years of schooling (but not age) were found to significantly affect the performance. The scores were corrected for this factor and the lower limit of the 90% tolerance interval around the mean of the adjusted scores was determined: it was found to correspond to 29 and left below it exactly 5% of the normal sample. The test was given to 200 aphasic patients. Fourteen (7%) were found to have an adjusted score of 29 or more, namely would have been classified as non-aphasic. This is a percentage remarkably smaller than that (40%) obtained with a 10 sentence comprehension test, which supports previous studies pointing to the sensitivity of the Token Test to the presence of oral language disorders. On the basis of the aphasic patients' performance, cutting scores allowing evaluation of the severity of the comprehension deficit are provided. The 36-item-version of the test appears to be an useful and convenient device to diagnose aphasic impairment of language comprehension.

We assessed a consecutive series of 278 patients with AD and 45 age-comparable healthy controls with a comprehensive psychiatric and neuropsychological evaluation. Caregivers rated the frequency of patients' exposure to dangerous situations or commission of dangerous behaviours. The frequency of dangerous behaviours was 16% in the AD group and 2% in the healthy control group. The presence of anosognosia was associated with a threefold increase in the risk of dangerous behaviours, but there was no significant association between dangerous behaviours and patients' age, years of education, diagnosis of major or minor depression and presence of suicide ideation. Sixteen per cent of a consecutive series of patients with AD had dangerous behaviours during the month preceding the clinical evaluation. Anosognosia was the main clinical correlate of dangerous behaviours in this population.

8624217|a|To determine whether the perceptions of patients' cognitive deficits by either the patient or an informant could predict who would develop Alzheimer disease (AD) in a group of 120 memory-impaired patients without dementia.At entry into the study, patients were assessed by several measures that included neuropsychological tests and the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination Interview Schedule. The latter schedule asks patients and their informants about their perceptions of cognitive deficits in the patients. After 2 years, patients underwent a diagnostic workup for AD: 29 had developed probable AD, whereas the other 91 did not develop dementia. We used logistic regression analyses to examine the predictive accuracy of patients' and informants' perceptions of deficits at entry into the study.Informants' perceptions, not patients' perceptions, contributed significantly to the prediction of AD. The best prediction of AD was obtained by the regression model that included both informants' perceptions and 2 neuropsychological tests.These results demonstrate the clinical use of including informant perceptions about patients' cognitive deficits in the diagnostic assessment of AD. They also indicate that patients' perceptions of their own deficits are not predictive of AD, but are related to depressive affect.

7235852|a|This is a review of theoretical, empirical, and clinical research on therapeutic factors (TFs) in group psychotherapy covering the period 1955 to 1979. Therapeutic factors are processes that contribute to improvement in the patient's condition; they are different from conditions for change and from techniques. The following TFs are examined: self-disclosure, interaction, acceptance (cohesiveness), insight, catharsis, guidance, altruism, vicarious learning, instillation of hope, and an existential factor. Criteria for adequate experimental design in group research are proposed. About 40% of the works reviewed contain empirical studies; the quality of these studies is variable both conceptually and methodologically. It is difficult to assess the extent to which clinical practice has actually been influenced by this work on TFs.

Treatment was conducted in a group format and consisted of: imaginal exposure, in which patients visualized their own participation in phobic events; performance-based exposure, in which patients enacted simulated phobic situations during sessions; cognitive restructuring, in which patients' cognitions experienced during exposure situations were assessed and analyzed; and systematic homework assignments involving the confrontation of environmental events previously simulated in the group. Self-report, behavioral, and physiological measures of anxiety were collected weekly during baseline and treatment periods, and additional measures were collected before and after treatment. After treatment, most patients demonstrated significant gains, and improvements were maintained at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups.

1270947|a|It has been suggested that oestriol protects against breast cancer, because in some experiments on uterine growth it is only weakly active, and partially inhibits the effects of oestradiol-17beta. When its effects are measured 24 h after a single injection, oestriol behaves as a typical impeded oestrogen with low potency and a flat dose-response line. This does not result from failure to stimulate certain critical stages of growth but from failure to sustain the products of growth. We found that oestriol induced all phases of uterine growth including DNA synthesis and cell division. It was as effective as oestradiol in stimulating early increases in protein synthesis and uterine weight, and half as effective in stimulating epithelial cells to replicate DNA and divide. However, epithelial cell numbers did not increase after a single injection of oestriol because cell death rate increased at the same time as mitotic rate, apparently as a result of the more rapid loss of oestriol from the uterus. Repeated injections of oestriol prevented premature cell death and produced as much uterine hypertrophy and hyperplasia as oestradiol-17beta. These results support the thesis that the oestrogenic potency of a substance is largely determined by the duration of its occupation of receptors. Thus in situations of continuous production, (e.g. pregnancy) oestriol would be as active as oestradiol and unlikely to exert any significant 'buffering' or protective action. The findings are also discussed in relation to a new model for the regulation of cell proliferation.

12927032|a|Epidemiological and experimental evidence implicates oestrogens in the aetiology of breast cancer. Most established risk factors for breast cancer in humans probably act through hormone-related pathways, and increased concentrations of circulating oestrogens have been found to be strongly associated with increased risk for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. This article explores the evidence for the hypothesis that oestrogen exposure is a major determinant of risk for breast cancer. We review recent data on oestrogens and breast cancer risk, consider oestrogen-related risk factors and examine possible mechanisms that might account for the effects of oestrogen. Finally, we discuss how these advances might influence strategies for reducing the incidence of breast cancer.

10872463|a|The MCM proteins are essential replication initiation factors originally identified as proteins required for minichromosome maintenance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The best known among them are a family of six structurally related proteins, MCM2-7, which are evolutionally conserved in all eukaryotes. The MCM2-7 proteins form a hexameric complex. This complex is a key component of the prereplication complex that assembles at replication origins during early G1 phase. New evidence suggests that the MCM2-7 proteins may be involved not only in the initiation but also in the elongation of DNA replication. Orchestration of the functional interactions between the MCM2-7 proteins and other components of the prereplication complex by cell cycle-dependent protein kinases results in initiation of DNA synthesis once every cell cycle.

15007098|a|The minichromosome maintenance (or MCM) protein family is composed of six related proteins that are conserved in all eukaryotes. They were first identified by genetic screens in yeast and subsequently analyzed in other experimental systems using molecular and biochemical methods. Early data led to the identification of MCMs as central players in the initiation of DNA replication. More recent studies have shown that MCM proteins also function in replication elongation, probably as a DNA helicase. This is consistent with structural analysis showing that the proteins interact together in a heterohexameric ring. However, MCMs are strikingly abundant and far exceed the stoichiometry of replication origins; they are widely distributed on unreplicated chromatin. Analysis of mcm mutant phenotypes and interactions with other factors have now implicated the MCM proteins in other chromosome transactions including damage response, transcription, and chromatin structure. These experiments indicate that the MCMs are central players in many aspects of genome stability.

10022912|a|The response of the uterine epithelium to female sex steroid hormones provides an excellent model to study cell proliferation in vivo since both stimulation and inhibition of cell proliferation can be studied. Thus, when administered to ovariectomized adult mice 17beta-estradiol (E2) stimulates a synchronized wave of DNA synthesis and cell division in the epithelial cells, while pretreatment with progesterone (P4) completely inhibits this E2-induced cell proliferation. Using a simple method to isolate the uterine epithelium with high purity, we have shown that E2 treatment induces a relocalization of cyclin D1 and, to a lesser extent, cdk4 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and results in the orderly activation of cyclin E- and cyclin A-cdk2 kinases and hyperphosphorylation of pRb and p107. P4 pretreatment did not alter overall levels of cyclin D1, cdk4, or cdk6 nor their associated kinase activities but instead inhibited the E2-induced nuclear localization of cyclin D1 to below the control level and, to a lesser extent, nuclear cdk4 levels, with a consequent inhibition of pRb and p107 phosphorylation. In addition, it abrogated E2-induced cyclin E-cdk2 activation by dephosphorylation of cdk2, followed by inhibition of cyclin A expression and consequently of cyclin A-cdk2 kinase activity and further inhibition of phosphorylation of pRb and p107. P4 is used therapeutically to oppose the effect of E2 during hormone replacement therapy and in the treatment of uterine adenocarcinoma. This study showing a novel mechanism of cell cycle inhibition by P4 may provide the basis for the development of new antiestrogens.

15845746|a|The mammalian cell cycle is regulated by the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (pRB) family of proteins. Cyclin D1 with its CDK4/6 partners initiates the cell cycle and acts as the link between extracellular signals and the cell cycle machinery. Estradiol-17beta (E2) stimulates uterine epithelial cell proliferation, a process that is completely inhibited by pretreatment with progesterone (P4). Previously, we identified cyclin D1 localization as a key point of regulation in these cells with E2 causing its nuclear accumulation and P4 retaining it in the cytoplasm with the resultant inhibition of pRB phosphorylation. Here we show that E2 stimulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase to activate phosphokinase B/AKT to effect an inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3beta). This pathway is suppressed by P4. Inhibition of the GSK-3beta activity in P4-treated uteri by the specific inhibitor, LiCl, reversed the nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 and in doing so, caused pRB phosphorylation and the induction of downstream genes, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67. Conversely, inhibition of phosphoinositide 3 kinase by LY294002 or Wortmanin reversed the E2-induced GSK-3beta Ser9 inhibitory phosphorylation and blocked nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1. These data show the reciprocal actions of E2 and P4 on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase through to the GSK-3beta pathway that in turn regulates cyclin D1 localization and cell cycle progression. These data reveal a novel signaling pathway that links E2 and P4 action to growth factor-mediated signaling in the uterus.

9832503|a|The activities of cyclin D-dependent kinases serve to integrate extracellular signaling during G1 phase with the cell-cycle engine that regulates DNA replication and mitosis. Induction of D-type cyclins and their assembly into holoenzyme complexes depend on mitogen stimulation. Conversely, the fact that D-type cyclins are labile proteins guarantees that the subunit pool shrinks rapidly when cells are deprived of mitogens. Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on a single threonine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Thr-286) positively regulates proteasomal degradation of D1. Now, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylates cyclin D1 specifically on Thr-286, thereby triggering rapid cyclin D1 turnover. Because the activity of GSK-3beta can be inhibited by signaling through a pathway that sequentially involves Ras, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt), the turnover of cyclin D1, like its assembly, is also Ras dependent and, hence, mitogen regulated. In contrast, Ras mutants defective in PI3K signaling, or constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase (MEK1) mutants that act downstream of Ras to activate extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), cannot stabilize cyclin D1. In direct contrast to cyclin D1, which accumulates in the nucleus during G1 phase and exits into the cytoplasm during S phase, GSK-3beta is predominantly cytoplasmic during G1 phase, but a significant fraction enters the nucleus during S phase. A highly stable D1 mutant in which an alanine is substituted for the threonine at position 286 and that is refractory to phosphorylation by GSK-3beta remained in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. Overexpression of an active, but not a kinase-defective, form of GSK-3beta in mouse fibroblasts caused a redistribution of cyclin D1 from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. Therefore, phosphorylation and proteolytic turnover of cyclin D1 and its subcellular localization during the cell division cycle are linked through the action of GSK-3beta.

This procedure, which requires no specialized apparatus, was developed for use with uteri in different hormonal states, and 2 uterine horns/tube, 5 glass balls and vortexing for 2 min are suggested for routine use. Under these conditions, 79--100% of the cells were removed, yielding epithelial fractions of 65--90% purity.

8858148|a|We have cloned a Xenopus Cdc6 homolog (Xcdc6) and characterized its role in DNA replication with Xenopus egg extracts. Immunodepletion of Xcdc6 abolishes chromosomal replication but not elongation on single-stranded DNA templates. Xcdc6 binds to chromatin at the beginning of interphase but disappears from chromatin upon initiation of replication. Immunodepletion studies indicate that binding of Xcdc6 to chromatin requires Xorc2, a component of the origin recognition complex. Moreover, Xmcm3 cannot bind to chromatin lacking Xcdc6, suggesting that Xorc2, Xcdc6, and Xmcm3 associate with the DNA sequentially. In postreplicative nuclei, Xcdc6 is associated with the nuclear envelope. These studies indicate that Xcdc6, is essential for initiation of replication in vertebrates and that interaction with the nuclear envelope may regulate its function.

10766247|a|In eukaryotic cells, chromosomal DNA replication begins with the formation of pre-replication complexes at replication origins. Formation and maintenance of pre-replication complexes is dependent upon CDC6 (ref. 1), a protein which allows assembly of MCM2-7 proteins, which are putative replicative helicases. The functional assembly of MCM proteins into chromatin corresponds to replication licensing. Removal of these proteins from chromatin in S phase is crucial in origins firing regulation. We have identified a protein that is required for the assembly of pre-replication complexes, in a screen for maternally expressed genes in Xenopus. This factor (XCDT1) is a relative of fission yeast cdt1, a protein proposed to function in DNA replication, and is the first to be identified in vertebrates. Here we show, using Xenopus in vitro systems, that XCDT1 is required for chromosomal DNA replication. XCDT1 associates with pre-replicative chromatin in a manner dependent on ORC protein and is removed from chromatin at the time of initiation of DNA synthesis. Immunodepletion and reconstitution experiments show that XCDT1 is required to load MCM2-7 proteins onto pre-replicative chromatin. These findings indicate that XCDT1 is an essential component of the system that regulates origins firing during S phase.

8626784|a|hCDC47 is a putative human homologue of yeast CDC47 and a member of the MCM protein family, which has been implicated in the regulatory machinery causing DNA to replicate only once in the S phase. In the present study, we performed an initial characterization of hCDC47. We found that hCDC47 protein was present in the nucleus of cultured human cells in two different forms; one extractable by a non-ionic detergent and the other resistant to such extraction and tightly associated with the nucleus. The levels of the nucleus-bound form gradually diminished during S phase progression, although the total amount of nuclear hCDC47 protein remained relatively constant, suggesting that the nucleus-bound form becomes dissociated from the nuclear structure during DNA replication. This behavior of hCDC47 protein is very similar to that of other mammalian MCM proteins reported recently. We also found that expression of hCDC47 mRNA was repressed in quiescent cells but was induced at the late G1 to S phase by growth factor stimulation. Together, these findings indicate that hCDC47 protein together with other MCM proteins participates in the regulation of mammalian DNA replication.

7790346|a|We have recently cloned and characterized a human member (BM28) of the MCM2-3-5 family of putative relication factors (Todorov, I.T., R. Pepperkok, R.N. Philipova, S. Kearsey, W. Ansorge, and D. Werner. 1994. J. Cell Sci. 107:253-265). While this protein is located in the nucleus throughout interphase, we report here a dramatic alteration in its nuclear binding during the cell cycle. BM28 is retained in the nucleus after Triton X-100 extraction in G1 and early S phase cells, but is progressively lost as S phase proceeds, and little BM28 is retained in detergent-extracted G2 nuclei. BM28 that is resistant to extraction in G1 nuclei is removed by DNase I digestion, suggesting that the protein is chromatin associated. In addition, we present evidence for variations in the electrophoretic mobility of BM28 that may reflect posttranslational modifications of BM28 during the cell cycle. During mitosis, BM28 is present as a fast-migrating form, but on entry into G1, the protein is converted into a slow-migrating form. With the onset of S phase, the slow-migrating form is progressively converted into the fast form. BM28 is phosphorylated at all stages of the cell cycle, but during interphase the fast form is hyperphosphorylated compared with the slow form. These apparent changes in modification may reflect or effect changes in the nuclear binding of BM28. The behavior of BM28 is not dissimilar to related proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such as Mcm2p, which are excluded from the nucleus after DNA replication. We speculate that BM28 may be involved in the control that limits eukaryotic DNA replication to one round per cell cycle.

7557380|a|Although progesterone has been recognized as essential for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, this steroid hormone has been recently implicated to have a functional role in a number of other reproductive events. The physiological effects of progesterone are mediated by the progesterone receptor (PR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors. In most cases the PR is induced by estrogen, implying that many of the in vivo effects attributed to progesterone could also be the result of concomitantly administered estrogen. Therefore, to clearly define those physiological events that are specifically attributable to progesterone in vivo, we have generated a mouse model carrying a null mutation of the PR gene using embryonic stem cell/gene targeting techniques. Male and female embryos homozygous for the PR mutation developed normally to adulthood. However, the adult female PR mutant displayed significant defects in all reproductive tissues. These included an inability to ovulate, uterine hyperplasia and inflammation, severely limited mammary gland development, and an inability to exhibit sexual behavior. Collectively, these results provide direct support for progesterone's role as a pleiotropic coordinator of diverse reproductive events that together ensure species survival.

12456805|a|The cellular actions of steroid hormone progesterone (P) are mediated via its nuclear receptors, which regulate the expression of specific target genes. The identity of gene networks that are regulated by the P receptors (PRs) in the uterus at various stages of the reproductive cycle and pregnancy, however, remain largely unknown. In this study, we have used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify mRNAs whose expression in the pregnant mouse uterus is modulated by RU486, a well-characterized PR antagonist, which is also an effective inhibitor of implantation. We found that, in response to RU486, expression of mRNAs corresponding to 78 known genes was down-regulated at least 2-fold in the preimplantation mouse uterus. The PR regulation of several of these genes was ascertained by administering P to ovariectomized wild-type and PR knockout (PRKO) mice. Detailed spatio-temporal analysis of these genes in the pregnant uterus indicated that their expression in the epithelium and stroma could be correlated with the expression of PR in those cell types. Furthermore, time-course studies suggested that many of these genes are likely primary targets of PR regulation. We also identified 70 known genes that were up-regulated at least 2-fold in the pregnant uterus in response to RU486. Interestingly, initial examination of a number of RU486-inducible genes reveals that their uterine expression is also regulated by estrogen. The identification of several novel PR-regulated gene pathways in the reproductive tract is an important step toward understanding how P regulates the physiological events leading to implantation.

11551965|a|Infertility and spontaneous pregnancy losses are an enduring problem to women's health. The establishment of pregnancy depends on successful implantation, where a complex series of interactions occurs between the heterogeneous cell types of the uterus and blastocyst. Although a number of genes are implicated in embryo-uterine interactions during implantation, genetic evidence suggests that only a small number of them are critical to this process. To obtain a global view and identify novel pathways of implantation, we used a dual screening strategy to analyze the expression of nearly 10,000 mouse genes by microarray analysis. Comparison of implantation and interimplantation sites by a conservative statistical approach revealed 36 up-regulated genes and 27 down-regulated genes at the implantation site. We also compared the uterine gene expression profile of progesterone-treated, delayed implanting mice to that of mice in which delayed implantation was terminated by estrogen. The results show up-regulation of 128 genes and down-regulation of 101 genes after termination of the delayed implantation. A combined analysis of these experiments showed specific up-regulation of 27 genes both at the implantation site and during uterine activation, representing a broad diversity of molecular functions. In contrast, the majority of genes that were decreased in the combined analysis were related to host immunity or the immune response, suggesting the importance of these genes in regulating the uterine environment for the implanting blastocyst. Collectively, we identified genes with recognized roles in implantation, genes with potential roles in this process, and genes whose functions have yet to be defined in this event. The identification of unique genetic markers for the onset of implantation signifies that genome-wide analysis coupled with functional assays is a promising approach to resolve the molecular pathways required for successful implantation.

Ovariectomized mice were exposed to 17beta-estradiol and the temporal mRNA expression changes of ten thousand various genes were analyzed. Clustering analysis revealed that there are at least two phases of gene activation during the period up to six hours. One involved immediate-early genes, which included certain transcription factors and growth factors as well as oncogenes. The other involved early-late genes, which included genes related to RNA and protein synthesis. In clusters of down-regulated genes, transcription factors, proteases, apoptosis and cell cycle genes were found. These hormone-inducible genes were not induced in estrogen receptor (ER) alpha knockout mice. Although expression of ERbeta is known in the uterus, these findings indicate the importance of ERalpha in the changes in gene expression in the uterus.

12021176|a|Implantation in humans is a complex process that is temporally and spatially restricted. Over the past decade, using a one-by-one approach, several genes and gene products that may participate in this process have been identified in secretory phase endometrium. Herein, we have investigated global gene expression during the window of implantation (peak E2 and progesterone levels) in well characterized human endometrial biopsies timed to the LH surge, compared with the late proliferative phase (peak E2 level) of the menstrual cycle. Tissues were processed for poly(A(+)) RNA and hybridization of chemically fragmented, biotinylated cRNAs on high density oligonucleotide microarrays, screening for 12,686 genes and expressed sequence tags. After data normalization, mean values were obtained for gene readouts and fold ratios were derived comparing genes up- and down-regulated in the window of implantation vs. the late proliferative phase. Nonparametric testing revealed 156 significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated genes and 377 significantly down-regulated genes in the implantation window. Up-regulated genes included those for cholesterol trafficking and transport [apolipoprotein (Apo)E being the most induced gene, 100-fold], prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis (PLA2) and action (PGE2 receptor), proteoglycan synthesis (glucuronyltransferase), secretory proteins [glycodelin, mammaglobin, Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1, a Wnt inhibitor)], IGF binding protein (IGFBP), and TGF-beta superfamilies, signal transduction, extracellular matrix components (osteopontin, laminin), neurotransmitter synthesis (monoamine oxidase) and receptors (gamma aminobutyric acid A receptor pi subunit), numerous immune modulators, detoxification genes (metallothioneins), and genes involved in water and ion transport [e.g. Clostridia Perfringens Enterotoxin (CPE) 1 receptor (CPE1-R) and K(+) ion channel], among others. Down-regulated genes included intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) [the most repressed gene (50-fold)], matrilysin, members of the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, frizzled-related protein (FrpHE, a Wnt antagonist), transcription factors, TGF-beta signaling pathway members, immune modulators (major histocompatibility complex class II subunits), and other cellular functions. Validation of select genes was conducted by Northern analysis and RT-PCR using RNA from endometrial biopsies obtained in the proliferative phase and the implantation window and by RT-PCR using RNA from cultured endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. These approaches confirmed up-regulation of genes corresponding to IGFBP-1, glycodelin, CPE1-R, Dkk-1, mammaglobin, and ApoD and down-regulation for PR membrane component 1, FrpHE, matrilysin, and ITF, as with the microarray data. Cultured endometrial epithelial cells were found to express mRNAs for glycodelin, CPE-1R, Dkk-1, the gamma aminobutyric acid A receptor pi subunit, mammaglobin, matrilysin, ITF and PR membrane component 1. The expression of IGFBP-1, CPE1-R, Dkk-1, and ApoD mRNAs increased upon decidualization of stromal cells in vitro with progesterone after E2 priming, whereas FrpHE decreased, consistent with the microarray results. Overall, the data demonstrate numerous genes and gene families not heretofore recognized in human endometrium or associated with the implantation process. Reassuringly, several gene products, known to be differentially expressed in the implantation window or in secretory endometrium, were verified, and the striking regulation of select secretory proteins, water and ion channels, signaling molecules, and immune modulators underscores the important roles of these systems in endometrial development and endometrial-embryonic interactions. In addition, the current study validates using high density oligonucleotide microarray technology to investigate global changes in gene expression in human endometrium.

12183439|a|Colonic epithelial cells undergo cell cycle arrest, lineage specific differentiation, and apoptosis, as they migrate along the crypt axis toward the lumenal surface. The Caco-2 colon carcinoma cell line models many of these phenotypic changes, in vitro. We used this model system and cDNA microarray analysis to characterize the genetic reprogramming that accompanies colon cell differentiation. The analyses revealed extensive yet functionally coordinated alterations in gene expression during the differentiation program. Consistent with cell differentiation reflecting a more specialized phenotype, the majority of changes (70%) were down-regulations of gene expression. Specifically, Caco-2 cell differentiation was accompanied by the coordinate down-regulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis, which reflected the concomitant reduction in cell proliferation. Simultaneously, genes involved in RNA splicing and transport, protein translation, folding, and degradation, were coordinately down-regulated, paralleled by a reduction in protein synthesis. Conversely, genes involved in xenobiotic and drug metabolism were up-regulated, which was linked to increased resistance of differentiated cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Increased expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix deposition, lipid transport, and lipid metabolism were also evident. Underlying these altered profiles of expression, components of signal transduction pathways, and several transcription factors were altered in expression.

4043253|a|The mouse uterine epithelium under various hormonal regimes is a good system to identify biochemical events associated with cell growth, DNA synthesis and cell division. This is because estradiol-17 beta stimulates the cells to undergo a synchronized wave of DNA synthesis and cell division. Estriol, on the other hand, also stimulates DNA synthesis but because of the rapid loss of this hormone from the tissue some of the cells abort, giving a constant epithelial cell number. Three days of progesterone pretreatment, however, completely suppresses the estradiol-17 beta-induced wave of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Using these hormonal treatments we have shown that both estradiol-17 beta and estriol stimulate protein and rRNA synthesis with the concomitant increase of protein and rRNA per mg of DNA. These macromolecules accumulated in direct proportion to the fraction of cell committed to DNA synthesis. Estriol, however, did not sustain the growth responses and at the peak of DNA synthesis both rRNA and protein synthesis had returned to control levels. Progesterone pretreatment, despite inhibiting the proliferative response, failed to inhibit any of the estradiol-17 beta-induced increases in protein and rRNA synthesis. Indeed 12 h after estradiol-17 beta injection the cells had identical protein and rRNA contents, regardless of whether they had been exposed to progesterone or not. The present data therefore suggests that in the uterine epithelium cell growth as defined by protein and rRNA accumulation and DNA synthesis represents two independently regulated pathways.

9077461|a|The members of the MCM protein family, including MCM2, MCM3, Cdc21, CDC46, Mis5 and CDC47, are considered to be involved in the control of a single round of DNA replication during S phase in eukaryotes. They bind to chromatin during G1 and detach from it during S phase as if they license the chromatin to replicate. However, unlike the originally proposed 'licensing factor' and the budding yeast homologues, mammalian MCM2 and P1MCM3 proteins appeared to be localized in the nucleus during the interphase.We purified mCdc21 and its associated proteins from mouse cell extract by anti-mCdc21 immunoaffinity chromatography. Three proteins which co-purified with mCdc21 were identified as mCDC47, mMis5 and mMCM2, all were MCM proteins. Glycerol gradient centrifugation analysis showed that all the mouse MCM proteins were detected at 450-600 kDa, an indication of the sum of their calculated molecular weights from their amino acid sequences. mCdc21 was displaced from replicated chromatin in a similar way to P1MCM3 and MCM2 during S phase. Among the six mouse MCM proteins, only mMCM2 and mP1MCM3 showed nuclear localization when overexpressed in COS cells.We conclude that in the mouse, six MCM proteins form a single protein complex of molecular weight 450-600 kDa, which may enter the nucleus by nuclear localization signals in the mMCM2 and mP1MCM3 subunits.

9214647|a|In eukaryotes, chromosomal DNA is licensed for a single round of replication in each cell cycle. Xenopus MCM3 protein has been implicated in the licensing of replication in egg extract. We have cloned cDNAs encoding five immunologically distinct proteins associated with Xenopus MCM3 as members of the MCM/P1 family. Six Xenopus MCM proteins formed a physical complex in the egg extract, bound to unreplicated chromatin before the formation of nuclei, and apparently displaced from replicated chromatin. The requirement of six XMCM proteins for the replication activity of the egg extract before nuclear formation suggests that their re-association with replicated chromatin at the end of the mitotic cell cycle is a key step for the licensing of replication.

10588642|a|The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins MCM2-MCM7 are conserved eukaryotic replication factors that assemble in a heterohexameric complex. In fission yeast, these proteins are nuclear throughout the cell cycle. In studying the mechanism that regulates assembly of the MCM complex, we analyzed the cis and trans elements required for nuclear localization of a single subunit, Mcm2p. Mutation of any single mcm gene leads to redistribution of wild-type MCM subunits to the cytoplasm, and this redistribution depends on an active nuclear export system. We identified the nuclear localization signal sequences of Mcm2p and showed that these are required for nuclear targeting of other MCM subunits. In turn, Mcm2p must associate with other MCM proteins for its proper localization; nuclear localization of MCM proteins thus requires assembly of MCM proteins in a complex. We suggest that coupling complex assembly to nuclear targeting and retention ensures that only intact heterohexameric MCM complexes remain nuclear.

9427284|a|The proteins of the Mcm2-7 family are required for the initiation of DNA replication. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the nuclear envelope does not break down during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Large nuclear proteins, such as the Mcm proteins, which accumulate in the nucleus during specific portions of the cell cycle, must have regulated mechanisms to direct their entry into the nucleus.We have identified a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in Mcm3, and demonstrated that it is necessary for the translocation of Mcm3 into the nucleus and sufficient for directing Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase to the nucleus. Immediately adjacent to the nuclear localization sequence are four potential sites for phosphorylation by Cdc28. Mutagenesis of all four sites has no immediate phenotypic effect on cell growth or viability, nor does it affect nuclear accumulation of Mcm3, although two-dimensional protein gel analysis has shown that at least some of these sites are normally phosphorylated in vivo. Substitution of the Mcm3 NLS by the SV40 large T-antigen NLS also directs the nuclear accumulation of the Mcm3-T-antigen protein, although cell growth is compromised. Replication activity in cells bearing either the Mcm3-Cdc28 phosphorylation site mutations or the Mcm3 T-antigen NLS substitution, as measured by plasmid stability assays, is comparable to activity in wild-type cells.The Mcm3 protein is imported into the nucleus by a specific NLS. The cell cycle specific nuclear accumulation of Mcm3 appears to be a result of nuclear retention or nuclear targeting, rather than nuclear import regulated through the NLS.

10834843|a|Little is known about the DNA helicases required for the elongation phase of eukaryotic chromosome replication. Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) protein complexes have DNA helicase activity but have only been functionally implicated in initiating DNA replication. Using an improved method for constructing conditional degron mutants, we show that depletion of MCMs after initiation irreversibly blocks the progression of replication forks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Like the Escherichia coli dnaB and SV40 T antigen helicases, therefore, the MCM complex is loaded at origins before initiation and is essential for elongation. Restricting MCM loading to the G(1) phase ensures that initiation and elongation occur just once per cell cycle.

9914167|a|MCM proteins are a conserved family of eukaryotic replication factors implicated in the initiation of DNA replication and in the discrimination between replicated and unreplicated chromatin. However, most mcm mutants in yeast arrest the cell cycle after bulk DNA synthesis has occurred. We investigated the basis for this late S phase arrest by analyzing the effects of a temperature-sensitive mutation in fission yeast cdc19(+ )(mcm2(+)). cdc19-P1 cells show a dramatic loss of viability at the restrictive temperature, which is not typical of all S phase mutants. The cdc19-P1 cell cycle arrest requires an intact damage-response checkpoint and is accompanied by increased rates of chromosome loss and mitotic recombination. Chromosomes from cdc19-P1 cells migrate aberrantly in pulsed-field gels, typical of strains arrested with unresolved replication intermediates. The cdc19-P1 mutation reduces the level of the Cdc19 protein at all temperatures. We compared the effects of disruptions of cdc19(+ )(mcm2(+)), cdc21(+ )(mcm4(+)), nda4(+ )(mcm5(+)) and mis5(+ )(mcm6(+)); in all cases, the null mutants underwent delayed S phase but were unable to proceed through the cell cycle. Examination of protein levels suggests that this delayed S phase reflects limiting, but not absent, MCM proteins. Thus, reduced dosage of MCM proteins allows replication initiation, but is insufficient for completion of S phase and cell cycle progression.

10766248|a|To maintain genome stability in eukaryotic cells, DNA is licensed for replication only after the cell has completed mitosis, ensuring that DNA synthesis (S phase) occurs once every cell cycle. This licensing control is thought to require the protein Cdc6 (Cdc18 in fission yeast) as a mediator for association of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins with chromatin. The control is overridden in fission yeast by overexpressing Cdc18 (ref. 11) which leads to continued DNA synthesis in the absence of mitosis. Other factors acting in this control have been postulated and we have used a re-replication assay to identify Cdt1 (ref. 14) as one such factor. Cdt1 cooperates with Cdc18 to promote DNA replication, interacts with Cdc18, is located in the nucleus, and its concentration peaks as cells finish mitosis and proceed to S phase. Both Cdc18 and Cdt1 are required to load the MCM protein Cdc21 onto chromatin at the end of mitosis and this is necessary to initiate DNA replication. Genes related to Cdt1 have been found in Metazoa and plants (A. Whitaker, I. Roysman and T. Orr-Weaver, personal communication), suggesting that the cooperation of Cdc6/Cdc18 with Cdt1 to load MCM proteins onto chromatin may be a generally conserved feature of DNA licensing in eukaryotes.

14672932|a|Chromosomal DNA replication requires the recruitment of the six-subunit minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) complex to chromatin through the action of Cdc6 and Cdt1. Although considerable work has described the functions of Cdc6 and Cdt1 in yeast and biochemical systems, evidence that their mammalian counterparts are subject to distinct regulation suggests the need to further explore the molecular relationships involving Cdc6 and Cdt1. Here we demonstrate that Cdc6 and Cdt1 are mutually dependent on one another for loading Mcm complexes onto chromatin in mammalian cells. The association of Cdt1 with Mcm2 is regulated by cell growth. Mcm2 prepared from quiescent cells associates very weakly with Cdt1, whereas Mcm2 from serum-stimulated cells associates with Cdt1 much more efficiently. Cdc6, which normally accumulates as cells progress from quiescence into G(1), is capable of inducing the binding of Mcm2 to Cdt1 when ectopically expressed in quiescent cells. We further show that Cdc6 physically associates with Cdt1 via its N-terminal noncatalytic domain, a region we had previously shown to be essential for Cdc6 function. Cdt1 activity is inhibited by the geminin protein, and we provide evidence that the mechanism of this inhibition involves blocking the binding of Cdt1 to both Mcm2 and Cdc6. These results identify novel molecular functions for both Cdc6 and geminin in controlling the association of Cdt1 with other components of the replication apparatus and indicate that the association of Cdt1 with the Mcm complex is controlled as cells exit and reenter the cell cycle.

RNA expression data were generated in seven laboratories, which compared two standard RNA samples using 12 microarray platforms. At least two standard microarray types (one spotted, one commercial) were used by all laboratories. Reproducibility for most platforms within any laboratory was typically good, but reproducibility between platforms and across laboratories was generally poor. Reproducibility between laboratories increased markedly when standardized protocols were implemented for RNA labeling, hybridization, microarray processing, data acquisition and data normalization. Reproducibility was highest when analysis was based on biological themes defined by enriched Gene Ontology (GO) categories. These findings indicate that microarray results can be comparable across multiple laboratories, especially when a common platform and set of procedures are used.

Their students are conducting successful microarray experiments designed to address a variety of interesting questions. A next step in these teaching and research laboratory projects is often validation of the microarray data for individual selected genes. In the research community, this usually involves the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technology that requires instrumentation and reagents that are prohibitively expensive for most undergraduate institutions.

11726523|a|Duplexes of 21-23 nucleotide (nt) RNAs are the sequence-specific mediators of RNA interference (RNAi) and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Synthetic, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were examined in Drosophila melanogaster embryo lysate for their requirements regarding length, structure, chemical composition and sequence in order to mediate efficient RNAi. Duplexes of 21 nt siRNAs with 2 nt 3' overhangs were the most efficient triggers of sequence-specific mRNA degradation. Substitution of one or both siRNA strands by 2'-deoxy or 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides abolished RNAi, although multiple 2'-deoxynucleotide substitutions at the 3' end of siRNAs were tolerated. The target recognition process is highly sequence specific, but not all positions of a siRNA contribute equally to target recognition; mismatches in the centre of the siRNA duplex prevent target RNA cleavage. The position of the cleavage site in the target RNA is defined by the 5' end of the guide siRNA rather than its 3' end. These results provide a rational basis for the design of siRNAs in future gene targeting experiments.

9486653|a|Experimental introduction of RNA into cells can be used in certain biological systems to interfere with the function of an endogenous gene. Such effects have been proposed to result from a simple antisense mechanism that depends on hybridization between the injected RNA and endogenous messenger RNA transcripts. RNA interference has been used in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to manipulate gene expression. Here we investigate the requirements for structure and delivery of the interfering RNA. To our surprise, we found that double-stranded RNA was substantially more effective at producing interference than was either strand individually. After injection into adult animals, purified single strands had at most a modest effect, whereas double-stranded mixtures caused potent and specific interference. The effects of this interference were evident in both the injected animals and their progeny. Only a few molecules of injected double-stranded RNA were required per affected cell, arguing against stochiometric interference with endogenous mRNA and suggesting that there could be a catalytic or amplification component in the interference process.

15629712|a|The investigation of protein function through the inhibition of activity has been critical to our understanding of many normal and abnormal biological processes. Until recently, functional inhibition in biological systems has been induced using a variety of approaches including small molecule antagonists, antibodies, aptamers, ribozymes, antisense oligonucleotides or transcripts, morpholinos, dominant-negative mutants, and knockout transgenic animals. Although all of these approaches have made substantial advances in our understanding of the function of many proteins, a lack of specificity or restricted applicability has limited their utility. Recently, exploitation of the naturally occurring posttranscriptional gene silencing mechanism triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), termed RNA interference (RNAi), has gained much favor as an alternative means for analyzing gene function. Aspects of the basic biology of RNAi, its application as a functional genomics tool, and its potential as a therapeutic approach have been extensively reviewed (Hannon and Rossi, 2004; Meister and Tuschl, 2004); however, there has been only limited discussion as to how to design and validate an individual RNAi effector molecule and how to interpret RNAi data overall, particularly with reference to experimentation in mammalian cells. This perspective will aim to consider some of the issues encountered when conducting and interpreting RNAi experiments in mammalian cells.

15778705|a|Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that mediate specific gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi) are widely used to study gene function and are also being developed for therapeutic applications. Many nucleic acids, including double- (dsRNA) and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), can stimulate innate cytokine responses in mammals. Despite this, few studies have questioned whether siRNA may have a similar effect on the immune system. This could significantly influence the in vivo application of siRNA owing to off-target effects and toxicities associated with immune stimulation. Here we report that synthetic siRNAs formulated in nonviral delivery vehicles can be potent inducers of interferons and inflammatory cytokines both in vivo in mice and in vitro in human blood. The immunostimulatory activity of formulated siRNAs and the associated toxicities are dependent on the nucleotide sequence. We have identified putative immunostimulatory motifs that have allowed the design of siRNAs that can mediate RNAi but induce minimal immune activation.

14758366|a|Short-interfering RNAs suppress gene expression through a highly regulated enzyme-mediated process called RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi involves multiple RNA-protein interactions characterized by four major steps: assembly of siRNA with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), activation of the RISC, target recognition and target cleavage. These interactions may bias strand selection during siRNA-RISC assembly and activation, and contribute to the overall efficiency of RNAi. To identify siRNA-specific features likely to contribute to efficient processing at each step, we performed a systematic analysis of 180 siRNAs targeting the mRNA of two genes. Eight characteristics associated with siRNA functionality were identified: low G/C content, a bias towards low internal stability at the sense strand 3'-terminus, lack of inverted repeats, and sense strand base preferences (positions 3, 10, 13 and 19). Further analyses revealed that application of an algorithm incorporating all eight criteria significantly improves potent siRNA selection. This highlights the utility of rational design for selecting potent siRNAs and facilitating functional gene knockdown studies.

14769924|a|RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is a widely used method to analyze gene function. To use RNAi knockdown accurately to infer gene function, it is essential to determine the specificity of siRNA-mediated RNAi. We have assessed the specificity of 10 different siRNAs corresponding to the MEN1 gene by examining the expression of two additional genes, TP53 (p53) and CDKN1A (p21), which are considered functionally unrelated to menin but are sensitive markers of cell state. MEN1 RNA and corresponding protein levels were all reduced after siRNA transfection of HeLa cells, although the degree of inhibition mediated by individual siRNAs varied. Unexpectedly, we observed dramatic and significant changes in protein levels of p53 and p21 that were unrelated to silencing of the target gene. The modulations in p53 and p21 levels were not abolished on titration of the siRNAs, and similar results were obtained in three other cell lines; in none of the cell lines tested did we see an effect on the protein levels of actin. These data suggest that siRNAs can induce nonspecific effects on protein levels that are siRNA sequence dependent but that these effects may be difficult to detect until genes central to a pivotal cellular response, such as p53 and p21, are studied. We find no evidence that activation of the double-stranded RNA-triggered IFN-associated antiviral pathways accounts for these effects, but we speculate that partial complementary sequence matches to off-target genes may result in a micro-RNA-like inhibition of translation.

16220141|a|The need to support bioinformatics training has been widely recognized by scientists, industry, and government institutions. However, the discussion of instructional methods for teaching bioinformatics is only beginning. Here we report on a systematic attempt to design two bioinformatics workshops for graduate biology students on the basis of Gagne's Conditions of Learning instructional design theory. This theory, although first published in the early 1970s, is still fundamental in instructional design and instructional technology. First, top-level as well as prerequisite learning objectives for a microarray analysis workshop and a primer design workshop were defined. Then a hierarchy of objectives for each workshop was created. Hands-on tutorials were designed to meet these objectives. Finally, events of learning proposed by Gagne's theory were incorporated into the hands-on tutorials. The resultant manuals were tested on a small number of trainees, revised, and applied in 1-day bioinformatics workshops. Based on this experience and on observations made during the workshops, we conclude that Gagne's Conditions of Learning instructional design theory provides a useful framework for developing bioinformatics training, but may not be optimal as a method for teaching it.

14500831|a|Multiple commercial microarrays for measuring genome-wide gene expression levels are currently available, including oligonucleotide and cDNA, single- and two-channel formats. This study reports on the results of gene expression measurements generated from identical RNA preparations that were obtained using three commercially available microarray platforms. RNA was collected from PANC-1 cells grown in serum-rich medium and at 24 h following the removal of serum. Three biological replicates were prepared for each condition, and three experimental replicates were produced for the first biological replicate. RNA was labeled and hybridized to microarrays from three major suppliers according to manufacturers' protocols, and gene expression measurements were obtained using each platform's standard software. For each platform, gene targets from a subset of 2009 common genes were compared. Correlations in gene expression levels and comparisons for significant gene expression changes in this subset were calculated, and showed considerable divergence across the different platforms, suggesting the need for establishing industrial manufacturing standards, and further independent and thorough validation of the technology.

9499584|a|Plant transgenes may participate in two types of homology-based gene silencing. One requires transcript homology, is post-transcriptional, and is referred to as cosuppression; the other requires promoter homology, is transcriptional, and is similar to paramutation. This paper uses flower color transgenes to address the hierarchical operation of both mechanisms in plants carrying two transgene copies. It is shown that cosuppression of homologous, endogenous flower color genes by single-copy transgenes requires that the transgene be driven by a strong promoter and that the degree of cosuppression is highly sensitive to increasing transgene dosage. Together, these observations suggest that cosuppression should be a sensitive reporter of epigenetic changes in transgene transcription, such as might be caused by paramutation-like interactions between transgene loci. Intercrosses bringing together two homologous transgene loci, one a known epimutable reporter and the other a transgene inverted repeat, result in complete loss of cosuppression in some outcross progeny and a qualitative change in morphology-based patterns of cosuppression in other outcross progeny. This paramutation-like behavior suggests that the transgenes may be altered at the transcriptional level, eliminating cosuppression altogether or changing the spatial pattern of transgene transcription to produce a new pattern of cosuppression.

15882138|a|Commonly accepted intensity-dependent normalization in spotted microarray studies takes account of measurement errors in the differential expression ratio but ignores measurement errors in the total intensity, although the definitions imply the same measurement error components are involved in both statistics. Furthermore, identification of differentially expressed genes is usually considered separately following normalization, which is statistically problematic. By incorporating the measurement errors in both total intensities and differential expression ratios, we propose a measurement-error model for intensity-dependent normalization and identification of differentially expressed genes. This model is also flexible enough to incorporate intra-array and inter-array effects. A Bayesian framework is proposed for the analysis of the proposed measurement-error model to avoid the potential risk of using the common two-step procedure. We also propose a Bayesian identification of differentially expressed genes to control the false discovery rate instead of the ad hoc thresholding of the posterior odds ratio. The simulation study and an application to real microarray data demonstrate promising results.

8304044|a|It is well known that there is a relationship between muscle strength and bone density, but it is uncertain whether this relationship is site specific. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of quadriceps strength to site-specific bone mineral density (BMD) of the tibia and to BMD of the forearm. In 66 healthy women, aged 21-78 years, BMD was measured in the proximal tibia and the distal forearm by dual-photon absorptiometry. Isometric and isokinetic strength of the quadriceps was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex II). Highly significant correlations between BMD of the proximal tibia and quadriceps strength were found (RS ranging from 0.79 to 0.84, p < 0.0001). Also, BMD of the distal forearm was correlated with quadriceps strength (RS ranging from 0.59 to 0.62, p < 0.0001). In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, quadriceps strength was a better predictor of tibial BMD than age, body height, or weight. However, age, height, and weight were more predictive of forearm BMD than quadriceps strength. When studying the pre- and postmenopausal women separately, quadriceps strength was correlated with BMD of the proximal tibia but not to forearm BMD. In conclusion, the study provides support for a site-specific relationship between muscle and bone.

8805035|a|In connection with the prevention of osteoporosis, paediatrics is challenged with ensuring the optimal formation of the skeletal system with maximal bone strength during childhood and youth. Biomechanical use represents the most important stimulus for activating the skeletal system. The measurement of muscle strength (grip strength) in 97 females aged 3-62 years and 71 males aged 3-61 years showed an age-dependent course. On the whole, males have greater strength with a more pronounced increase after puberty, reaching a peak maximum at 25-30 years. Females show a more moderate increase after puberty. In a pilot study, bone strength (as bone strength index-BSI) was analysed at the distal radius using peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT). BSI was calculated on the basis of the geometric data of the polar moment of resistance in combination with the cortical bone density. BSI values increase with age and reach a peak maximum at 25-30 years. There was a highly significant correlation between BSI and grip strength (r = 0.87). These relationships are especially interesting for therapeutic concepts differentiating between direct and indirect (via the muscle system) influences on the skeletal system. The non-invasive bone strength analysis in combination with muscle strength offer new perspectives for the evaluation of the functional muscle-bone unit.

2382585|a|It is widely accepted that physical activity is beneficial to bone. However, the specific relationships of muscle strength to bone mineral density (BMD) are poorly understood. We examined strength and BMD in 59 women aged 18-31 years who ranged in exercise patterns from sedentary to active. Mineral density of the right proximal femur (hip) and spine (L2-4) was evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. BMD at the midradius was measured by single-photon absorptiometry. Dynamic strength (one repetition maximum) was measured for the following muscle groups: back, elbow flexors (biceps), leg extensors (quadriceps), and the hip flexors, extensors, adductors, and abductors. Isometric grip strength was assessed by dynamometry. Mineral density at the hip correlated independently with muscle strength and body weight, but not with age. Specifically, femoral neck BMD was significantly correlated with back strength and weight, whereas trochanter and overall hip mineral density were significantly related to biceps, back, and hip adductor strength. Hip mineral density was not related to strength of the quadriceps groups or to that of the hip flexors, extensors, or abductors. In addition, muscle strength was an independent predictor of lumbar spine and midradius mineral density. In stepwise multiple regression analysis, biceps strength proved the most robust predictor of hip BMD and grip strength best predicted bone density at the lumbar spine and radius. We conclude that muscle strength is an independent predictor of bone mineral density, accounting for 15-20% of the total variance in bone density of young women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

14565602|a|It has been hypothesized that increase in muscle mass increases the strain on bone resulting in increase in bone mass. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of increased muscle mass on bone. A colony of transgenic mice that overexpress hIGF-I in muscle, resulting in larger muscles, was established. Six-month-old heterozygous and wild type males were used in this study. The tibial diaphysis, femoral diaphysis and distal femoral metaphysis were analyzed using pQCT densitometry. Heterozygous animals had significantly higher body weight, muscle weight and muscle area when compared with wild type animals. Tibia and femur of the heterozygous mice had significantly higher weights and lengths. The tibial and femoral diaphyses of heterozygous animals had significantly higher cortical bone area, cortical bone mineral content, cortical bone mineral density, cortical thickness and periosteal perimeter when compared with wild type animals. In the distal femoral metaphysis, the total bone area and the cancellous bone area of heterozygous mice were significantly higher than those of wild type animals. In conclusion, increased muscle mass was associated with bigger bones in animals overexpressing IGF-I. Only pure cortical bone increased in both area and mineral content in these animals; cancellous bone, however, increased only in area and not in mineral content and density.

14554215|a|GDF-8, also known as myostatin, is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily of secreted growth and differentiation factors that is expressed in vertebrate skeletal muscle. Myostatin functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth and myostatin null mice show a doubling of muscle mass compared to normal mice. We describe here morphology of the lumbar spine in myostatin knockout (Mstn(-/-)) mice using histological and densitometric techniques. The Mstn(-/-) mice examined in this study weigh approximately 10% more than controls (p<0.001) but the iliopsoas muscle is over 50% larger in the knockout mice than in wild-type mice (p<0.001). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) data from the fifth lumbar vertebra show that mice lacking myostatin have approximately 50% greater trabecular bone mineral density (p=0.001) and significantly greater cortical bone mineral content than normal mice. Toluidine blue staining of the intervertebral disc between L4-L5 reveals loss of proteoglycan staining in the hyaline end plates and inner annulus fibrosus of the knockout mice. Loss of cartilage staining in the caudal end plate of L4 is due to ossification of the end plate in the myostatin-deficient animals. Results from this study suggest that increased muscle mass in mice lacking myostatin is associated with increased bone mass as well as degenerative changes in the intervertebral disc.

12704695|a|GDF8 (myostatin), a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of secreted growth and differentiation factors, is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. GDF8 knockout mice have approximately twice the skeletal muscle mass of normal mice. The effects of increased muscle mass on bone modeling were investigated by examining bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the femora of female GDF8 knockout mice. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry was used to measure whole-femur BMC and BMD, and pQCT densitometry was used to calculate BMC and BMD from cross-sections taken at two different locations: the midshaft and the distal metaphysis. The DEXA results show that the knockout mice have significantly greater femoral BMD than normal mice. The peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) data indicate that the GDF8 knockout mice have approximately 10% greater cortical BMC (P =.01) at the midshaft and over 20% greater cortical BMC at the metaphysis (P <.001). Likewise, knockouts show approximately 10% greater cortical thickness (P <.001) and significantly greater cortical BMD (P <.001) at both locations. These results suggest that inhibitors of GDF8 function may be useful pharmacological agents for increasing both muscle mass and BMD.

16491296|a|We tested the hypothesis that increased muscle mass augments increases in bone strength normally observed with exercise. Myostatin-deficient mice, which show increased muscle mass, were exercised along with wildtype mice. Results indicate that increases in bone strength with exercise are greater in myostatin-deficient mice than in wildtype mice, suggesting that the combination of increased muscle mass and physical activity has a greater effect on bone strength than either increased muscle mass or intense exercise alone.Muscle (lean) mass is known to be a significant predictor of peak BMD in young people, and exercise is also found to increase bone mass in growing humans and laboratory animals. We sought to determine if increased muscle mass resulting from myostatin deficiency would enhance gains in bone strength that usually accompany exercise.Male mice lacking myostatin (GDF-8) were used as an animal model showing increased muscle mass. Wildtype and myostatin-deficient mice (n = 10-12 per genotype) were exercised on a treadmill for 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks starting at 12 weeks of age. Caged wildtype and myostatin-deficient mice (n = 10-12 per genotype) were included as sedentary controls. Structural and biomechanical parameters were measured from the radius.Ultimate force (F(u)), displacement (D(u)), toughness (energy-to-fracture; U), and ultimate strain (epsilon(u)) increased significantly with exercise in myostatin-deficient mice but not in normal mice. When F(u) is normalized by body mass, exercised myostatin-deficient mice show an increase in relative bone strength of 30% compared with caged controls, whereas exercised wildtype mice do not show a significant increase in ultimate force relative to caged controls. Relative to body weight, the radii of exercised myostatin-deficient mice are >25% stronger than those of exercised normal mice.Increased muscle mass resulting from inhibition of myostatin function improves the positive effects of exercise on bone strength.

8554920|a|Five strains of inbred mice were found to have variations in bone mass although they were similar in body weight. Two of these strains, C57BL/6J and A/J, were studied in greater detail and the former had more bone in both femur and tibia. The increased bone mass was associated with larger quadriceps muscles in the C57BL/6J animals when measured at 18 weeks of age. Activities of animals from these two strains were studied over 24 h periods using a cage with an ultrasonic movement detector and automatic counter. The C57BL/6J animals were more active than the A/J mice. The male C57BL/6J mice tended to have larger testicles and higher testosterone levels than the A/J animals, whereas the female A/J animals had larger ovaries and higher oestradiol levels. As both male and female C57BL/6J animals were more active, it was concluded that the sex hormone differences between the two strains was not responsible for either the changes in bone mass or physical activity. These findings indicate that in the mouse, activity is in part genetically determined. We have hypothesized that this, in turn, could affect muscle mass and secondarily, bone size and strength. If these results can be applied to humans, it would suggest that differences at birth between individuals are important for bone mass in later life and that muscle mass and activity are in part genetically influenced. If this was the case, then muscle mass and strength could be a factor in bone mass and one of the goals in prevention and treatment of osteoporosis should be directed toward preservation and/or augmentation of muscle strength.

15121007|a|Mechanostat theory postulates that developmental changes in bone strength are secondary to the increasing loads imposed by larger muscle forces. Therefore, the increase in muscle strength should precede the increase in bone strength. We tested this prediction using densitometric surrogate measures of muscle force (lean body mass, LBM) and bone strength (bone mineral content, BMC) in a study on 70 boys and 68 girls who were longitudinally examined during pubertal development. On the level of the total body, the peak in LBM accrual preceded the peak in BMC accretion by an average of 0.51 years in girls and by 0.36 years in boys. In the arms, the maximal increase in LBM was followed by arm peak BMC accrual after an interval of 0.71 years in girls and 0.63 years in boys. In the lower extremities, the maximal increase in LBM was followed by peak BMC accrual after an interval of 0.22 years in girls and 0.48 years in boys. A multiple regression model revealed that total body peak LBM velocity, but not peak height velocity and sex, was independently associated with total body peak BMC velocity (r(2) = 0.50; P < 0.001). Similarly, arm and leg peak LBM velocity, but not peak height velocity and sex, were independently associated with arm and leg peak BMC velocity, respectively (r(2) = 0.61 for arms, r(2) = 0.41 for legs; P < 0.001 in both cases). These results are compatible with the view that bone development is driven by muscle development, although the data do not exclude the hypothesis that the two processes are independently determined by genetic mechanisms.

16750436|a|The mechanisms underlying age-related loss of muscle and bone tissue are poorly understood but are thought to involve changes in sex hormone status, physical activity, and circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines. This study attempts to develop an animal model useful for evaluating these mechanisms in vivo. Male C57BL/6 mice were included for study at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 29 months of age. Endocortical mineralizing surface, serum leptin, body weight, and percentage of body fat all increased between 6 and 12 months of age as activity level declined. Serum levels of the inflammatory marker IL-6 increased significantly after 12 months of age, following the observed increase in body weight and percent body fat. Hindlimb muscle mass declined significantly between 18 and 24 months of age, both absolutely and relative to total body mass, with a further decline ( approximately 15%) between 24 and 29 months. Loss of muscle mass after 18 months of age was accompanied by a significant increase in bone resorption, as indicated by serum pyridinoline cross-links, and a significant decrease in fat mass, serum leptin, bone strength, bone mineral density, and vertical cage activity. No significant changes in serum testosterone with aging were detected in the mice, as levels were essentially constant between 6 and 29 months. Our data show that mice lose a significant amount of muscle and bone tissue with age, and this loss of musculoskeletal tissue is accompanied by a drop in serum leptin and preceded by a significant decrease in physical activity.

8747608|a|Muscle strength and limb girth measurements during Skylab and Apollo missions suggested that loss of muscle mass may occur as a result of spaceflight. Extended duration spaceflight is important for the economical and practical use of space. The loss of muscle mass during spaceflight is a medical concern for long duration flights to the planets or extended stays aboard space stations. Understanding the extent and temporal relationships of muscle loss is important for the development of effective spaceflight countermeasures.We hypothesized that significant and measurable changes in muscle volume would occur in Shuttle crewmembers following 8 d of weightlessness.MRI was used to obtain the muscle volumes of the calf, thigh and lower back before and after the STS-47 Shuttle mission.Statistical analyses demonstrated that the soleus-gastrocnemius (-6.3%), anterior calf (-3.9%), hamstrings (-8.3%), quadriceps (-6.0%) and intrinsic back (-10.3%) muscles were decreased, p < 0.05, compared to baseline, 24 h after landing. At 2 weeks post recovery, the hamstrings and intrinsic lower back muscles were still below baseline, p < 0.05.These results demonstrate that even short duration spaceflight can result in significant muscle atrophy.

9139826|a|The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily encompasses a large group of growth and differentiation factors playing important roles in regulating embryonic development and in maintaining tissue homeostasis in adult animals. Using degenerate polymerase chain reaction, we have identified a new murine TGF-beta family member, growth/differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), which is expressed specifically in developing and adult skeletal muscle. During early stages of embryogenesis, GDF-8 expression is restricted to the myotome compartment of developing somites. At later stages and in adult animals, GDF-8 is expressed in many different muscles throughout the body. To determine the biological function of GDF-8, we disrupted the GDF-8 gene by gene targeting in mice. GDF-8 null animals are significantly larger than wild-type animals and show a large and widespread increase in skeletal muscle mass. Individual muscles of mutant animals weigh 2-3 times more than those of wild-type animals, and the increase in mass appears to result from a combination of muscle cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy. These results suggest that GDF-8 functions specifically as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth.

9356471|a|Myostatin (GDF-8) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of secreted growth and differentiation factors that is essential for proper regulation of skeletal muscle mass in mice. Here we report the myostatin sequences of nine other vertebrate species and the identification of mutations in the coding sequence of bovine myostatin in two breeds of double-muscled cattle, Belgian Blue and Piedmontese, which are known to have an increase in muscle mass relative to conventional cattle. The Belgian Blue myostatin sequence contains an 11-nucleotide deletion in the third exon which causes a frameshift that eliminates virtually all of the mature, active region of the molecule. The Piedmontese myostatin sequence contains a missense mutation in exon 3, resulting in a substitution of tyrosine for an invariant cysteine in the mature region of the protein. The similarity in phenotypes of double-muscled cattle and myostatin null mice suggests that myostatin performs the same biological function in these two species and is a potentially useful target for genetic manipulation in other farm animals.

11115768|a|The mechanism of the loss of skeletal muscle mass that occurs during spaceflight is not well understood. Myostatin has been proposed as a negative modulator of muscle mass, and IGF-I and IGF-II are known positive regulators of muscle differentiation and growth. We investigated whether muscle loss associated with spaceflight is accompanied by increased levels of myostatin and a reduction in IGF-I and -II levels in the muscle, and whether these changes correlate with an increase in muscle proteolysis and apoptosis. Twelve male adult rats sent on the 17-day NASA STS-90 NeuroLab space flight were divided upon return to earth into two groups, and killed either 1 day later (R1) or after 13 days of acclimatization (R13). Ground-based control rats were maintained for the same periods in either vivarium (R3 and R15, respectively), or flight-simulated cages (R5 and R17, respectively). RNA and protein were isolated from the tibialis anterior, biceps femoris, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles. Myostatin, IGF-I, IGF-II and proteasome 2c mRNA concentrations were determined by reverse transcription/PCR; myostatin and ubiquitin mRNA were also measured by Northern blot analysis; myostatin protein was estimated by immunohistochemistry; the apoptotic index and the release of 3-methylhistidine were determined respectively by the TUNEL assay and by HPLC. Muscle weights were 19-24% lower in the R1 rats compared with the control R3 and R5 rats, but were not significantly different after the recovery period. The myostatin/beta-actin mRNA ratios (means+/-s.e.m. ) were higher in the muscles of the R1 rats compared with the control R5 rats: 5.0-fold in tibialis (5.35 +/- 1.85 vs 1.07 +/- 0.26), 3.0-fold in biceps (2.46+/-0.70 vs 0.81 +/- 0.04), 1.9-fold in quadriceps (7.84 +/- 1.73 vs 4.08 +/- 0.52), and 2.2-fold in gastrocnemius (0.99 +/- 0.35 vs 0.44 +/- 0.17). These values also normalized upon acclimatization. Our antibody against a myostatin peptide was validated by detection of the recombinant human myostatin protein on Western blots, which also showed that myostatin immunostaining was increased in muscle sections from R1 rats, compared with control R3 rats, and normalized upon acclimatization. In contrast, IGF-II mRNA concentrations in the muscles from R1 rats were 64-89% lower than those in R3 animals. With the exception of the gastrocnemius, IGF-II was also decreased in R5 animals maintained in flight-simulated cages, and normalized upon acclimatization. The intramuscular IGF-I mRNA levels were not significantly different between the spaceflight rats and the controls. No increase was found in the proteolysis markers 3-methyl histidine, ubiquitin mRNA, and proteasome 2C mRNA. In conclusion, the loss of skeletal muscle mass that occurs during spaceflight is associated with increased myostatin mRNA and protein levels in the skeletal muscle, and a decrease in IGF-II mRNA levels. These alterations are normalized upon restoration of normal gravity and caging conditions. These data suggest that reciprocal changes in the expression of myostatin and IGF-II may contribute to the multifactorial pathophysiology of muscle atrophy that occurs during spaceflight.

10627285|a|Previous findings have provided strong evidence that myostatin functions as a negative regulator of muscle mass during development and growth. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that myostatin may serve a similar function in fully differentiated muscle experiencing modified loading. Our findings show that myostatin expression can be modulated in fully differentiated, nonpathological skeletal muscle in a manner that is inversely related to changes in muscle mass. Atrophy of rat hind limb muscles induced by 10 days of unloading resulted in a 16% decrease in plantaris mass, a 110% increase in myostatin mRNA, and a 37% increase in myostatin protein. Immunohistochemical observations showed a detectable increase in myostatin concentration at myotendinous junctions during muscle unloading. The concentration of myostatin mRNA and protein returned to values not significantly different from ambulatory controls after 4 days of reloading, during which time plantaris mass also returned to control values. However, the results also show that periods of 30 min of daily muscle loading during the unloading period were sufficient to prevent significant losses of muscle mass caused by unloading, although myostatin mRNA still showed a 55% increase in concentration. Thus, significant increases in myostatin expression are not sufficient for muscle mass loss, although muscle mass loss during unloading is accompanied by increases in myostatin.

12029139|a|Mice and cattle with genetic deficiencies in myostatin exhibit dramatic increases in skeletal muscle mass, suggesting that myostatin normally suppresses muscle growth. Whether this increased muscling results from prenatal or postnatal lack of myostatin activity is unknown. Here we show that myostatin circulates in the blood of adult mice in a latent form that can be activated by acid treatment. Systemic overexpression of myostatin in adult mice was found to induce profound muscle and fat loss analogous to that seen in human cachexia syndromes. These data indicate that myostatin acts systemically in adult animals and may be a useful pharmacologic target in clinical settings such as cachexia, where muscle growth is desired.

12474026|a|Myostatin is a recently discovered member of the TGF-b superfamily of genes. It is expressed in skeletal muscle and believed to suppress muscle growth. Myostatin-null mice develop skeletal muscles that are 2-3x larger than wild type mice. Serum and intramuscular concentrations of myostatin-immunoreactive protein are increased in AIDS-muscle wasting and are inversely related with fat-free mass (FFM).We hypothesized that increased expression of the myostatin gene is associated with the reduction in FFM and muscle mass typical of advancing age.A cross-sectional comparison of serum myostatin-immunoreactive protein levels, FFM and skeletal muscle mass in 19-35 yr old men and women (young), healthy 60-75 yr old men and women (middle-aged), and physically frail 76-92 yr old women.Muscle mass declined with advancing age in both men and women. Serum myostatin-immunoreactive protein levels were the highest in the 76-92 yr old women (P<0.05). Middle-aged men and women had higher serum myostatin levels than young men and women (P<0.05). FFM and muscle mass, corrected for height, were inversely correlated with serum myostatin-immunoreactive protein concentrations.These findings suggest that serum myostatin may be a biomarker of age-associated sarcopenia. They are consistent with the hypothesis that the human myostatin gene product is a suppressor of skeletal muscle growth in advancing age.

9076583|a|Increasing evidence suggests a potential role for activin in bone formation. However, the cognate receptors through which activins function with respect to skeletal tissues have not yet been identified. Identification and regulation of expression of these receptors are necessary prerequisites to understanding the role of activins in bone metabolism. We detected mRNAs for three activin receptors, type I (ActRI), type II (ActRII), and type IIB (ActRIIB), in multiple skeletal tissues in rat, including tibia and costochondral growth plate, and also in cultured osteoblasts. To gain information about the relationship between receptor expression and different skeletal cell functions, we evaluated expression of the three receptors in a semiquantitative manner during the early stages of fracture healing, a model for rapid bone formation. Relatively high levels of ActRI and ActRII expression were detected in the callus at 7, 10, and 14 days after fracture, times that correlate with the interval of rapid intramembranous bone formation and the initiation of endochondral bone formation. Expression of the ActRIIB in the fracture callus was strikingly lower than either ActRI or ActRII. Immunostaining of the fracture callus and the newborn rat femur with an anti-ActRII antibody localized the receptor to osteoblasts at regions of membranous and endochondral bone formation. No staining of osteoblasts in fracture callus or bone was seen with an anti-ActRIIB antibody. These results provide strong evidence of the identification of the principal receptors through which activins could function in the skeletal system and further shed light on activin's mechanism of action in bone formation.

15878958|a|Inactivating mutations of the mammalian myostatin gene are associated with increased muscle mass and decreased fat mass; conversely, myostatin transgenic mice that overexpress myostatin in the skeletal muscle have decreased muscle mass and increased fat mass. We investigated the effects of recombinant myostatin protein and antimyostatin antibody on myogenic and adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal multipotent cells. Accordingly, 10T(1/2) cells were incubated with 5'-azacytidine for 3 d to induce differentiation and then treated with a recombinant protein for myostatin (Mst) carboxy terminal 113 amino acids or a polyclonal anti-Mst antibody for 3, 7, and 14 d. Cells were also cotransfected with a Mst cDNA plasmid expressing the full-length 375-amino acid protein (pcDNA-Mst375) and the silencer RNAs for either Mst (pSil-Mst) or a random sequence (pSil-RS) for 3 or 7 d, and Mst expression was determined. Adipogenesis was evaluated by quantitative image analysis of fat cells before and after oil-red-O staining, immunocytochemistry of adiponectin, and Western blot for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha. Myogenesis was estimated by quantitative image analysis-immunocytochemistry for MyoD (Myo differentiation protein), myogenin, and myosin heavy chain type II, or by Western blot for myogenin. 5'-Azacytidine-mediated differentiation induced endogenous full-length Mst expression. Recombinant Mst carboxy terminal 113 amino acids inhibited both early and late markers of myogenesis and stimulated both early and late markers of adipogenesis, whereas the antibody against Mst exerted the reverse effects. Myogenin levels at 7 d after transfection of pcDNA-Mst375 were reduced as expected and elevated by pSil-Mst, which blocked efficiently Mst375 expression. In conclusion, myostatin promotes the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells into the adipogenic lineage and inhibits myogenesis.

15067317|a|Based on the fact that aging is associated with a reciprocal decrease of osteogenesis and an increase of adipogenesis in bone marrow and that osteoblasts and adipocytes share a common progenitor, this study investigated the role of PPARgamma, a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation, in bone metabolism. Homozygous PPARgamma-deficient ES cells failed to differentiate into adipocytes, but spontaneously differentiated into osteoblasts, and these were restored by reintroduction of the PPARgamma gene. Heterozygous PPARgamma-deficient mice exhibited high bone mass with increased osteoblastogenesis, but normal osteoblast and osteoclast functions, and this effect was not mediated by insulin or leptin. The osteogenic effect of PPARgamma haploinsufficiency became prominent with aging but was not changed upon ovariectomy. The PPARgamma haploinsufficiency was confirmed to enhance osteoblastogenesis in the bone marrow cell culture but did not affect the cultures of differentiated osteoblasts or osteoclast-lineage cells. This study demonstrates a PPARgamma-dependent regulation of bone metabolism in vivo, in that PPARgamma insufficiency increases bone mass by stimulating osteoblastogenesis from bone marrow progenitors.

14499292|a|Fluid flow that arises from the functional loading of bone tissue has been proposed to be a critical regulator of skeletal mass and morphology. To test this hypothesis, the bone adaptive response to a physiological fluid stimulus, driven by low magnitude, high frequency oscillations of intramedullary pressure (ImP), were examined, in which fluid pressures were achieved without deforming the bone tissue. The ulnae of adult turkeys were functionally isolated via transverse epiphyseal osteotomies, and the adaptive response to four weeks of disuse (n=5) was compared to disuse plus 10 min per day of a physiological sinusoidal fluid pressure signal (60 mmHg, 20Hz). Disuse alone resulted in significant bone loss (5.7+/-1.9%, p< or =0.05), achieved by thinning the cortex via endosteal resorption and an increase in intracortical porosity. By also subjecting bone to oscillatory fluid flow, a significant increase in bone mass at the mid-diaphysis (18.3+/-7.6%, p<0.05), was achieved by both periosteal and endosteal new bone formation. The spatial distribution of the transcortical fluid pressure gradients (inverted Delta P(r)), a parameter closely related to fluid velocity and fluid shear stress, was quantified in 12 equal sectors across a section at the mid-diaphyses. A strong correlation was found between the inverted Delta P(r) and total new bone formation (r=0.75, p=0.01); and an inverse correlation (r=-0.75, p=0.01) observed between inverted Delta P(r) and the area of increased intracortical porosity, indicating that fluid flow signals were necessary to maintain bone mass and/or inhibit bone loss against the challenge of disuse. By generating this fluid flow in the absence of matrix strain, these data suggest that anabolic fluid movement plays a regulatory role in the modeling and remodeling process. While ImP increases uniformly in the marrow cavity, the distinct parameters of fluid flow vary substantially due to the geometry and ultrastructure of bone, which ultimately defines the spatial non-uniformity of the adaptive process.

10490920|a|The effects of antiresorptive drugs on bone loss remain unclear. Using three-dimensional microtomography, dual X-ray/densitometry, and histomorphometry, we evaluated tiludronate effects in the bone loss model of immobilization in tail-suspended rats after 7, 13, and 23 days. Seventy-eight 12-week-old Wistar male rats were assigned to 13 groups: 1 baseline group, and for each time point, 1 control group treated with vehicle and three tail-suspended groups treated with either tiludronate (0.5 or 5 mg/kg) or vehicle, administered s. c. every other day, during the last week before sacrifice. In primary spongiosa (ISP), immobilization-induced bone loss plateaued after day 7 and was prevented by tiludronate. In secondary spongiosa (IISP), bone loss appeared at day 13 with a decrease in trabecular thickness and trabecular number (Tb.N) as assessed by three-dimensional microtomography. Osteoclastic parameters did not differ in tail-suspended rats versus control rats, whereas bone formation showed a biphasic pattern: after a marked decrease at day 7, osteoblastic activity and recruitment normalized at days 13 and 23, respectively. At day 23, the 80% decrease in bone mass was fully prevented by high-dose tiludronate with an increase in Tb.N without preventing trabecular thinning. In summary, at day 7, tiludronate prevented bone loss in ISP. After day 13, tiludronate prevented bone loss in ISP and IISP despite a further decrease in bone formation. Thus, the preventive effects of tiludronate in this model may be related to the alteration in bone modeling with an increase in Tb.N in ISP and subsequently in IISP.

11907715|a|In this research we utilized tail-suspended rats as an in vivo model for bone loss studies in order to investigate the effects of the tail suspension on the structure of the suspended bones and in ex vivo cultures the activities of trabecular osteoblasts, marrow-derived osteogenic cells, and osteoclasts obtained from treated animals, compared with untreated controls. After a 5-day hind limb unloading, trabecular thinning was already evidenced in the tibial primary spongiosa. In the secondary spongiosa, the bone formation activity was reduced whereas osteoclastic parameters were not yet altered. Bone marrow-derived osteogenic cells and differentiated osteoblasts from enzymatic digestion of posterior limb trabecular bone were prepared from 5 day tail-suspended rats and from normally loaded rats as controls. Cell morphology, alkaline phosphatase (ALPH) activity, production of mineral matrix, osteocalcin, and IL-6 secretion were evaluated in both cell populations. Tail suspension reduced the osteogenic potential of stromal marrow cells and of already differentiated osteoblasts. In fact, ALP positive colonies were significantly reduced in number and were smaller in size compared with controls and bone nodules formed in permissive conditions were also significantly fewer and smaller, whereas in cultures of cells from control conditions, large mineralizing nodules were formed. Osteocalcin secretion was not affected by unloading. Finally, IL-6 concentration was increased in marrow-derived cells from treated rats compared with controls. Primary cultures of osteoclasts were obtained from the nonadherent fraction of the bone marrow of the same animals. The number of TRAP positive cells in culture from tail-suspended rats was significantly increased, as well as bone resorption activity, measured as resorbed surfaces of a suitable synthetic hydroxyapatite, compared with controls. These data clearly suggest that skeletal unloading not only reduces the osteogenic potential of osteoblastic cells but induces an increased osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity in ex vivo cultures. They also indicate for the first time that a possible mediator responsible for the increased osteoclastogenesis could be represented by the IL-6 whose secretion by bone marrow cells was significantly enhanced by unloading.

11174839|a|The expression and localization of activins (dimeric protein of inhibin beta subunit) and activin receptors in skeletal tissue were examined. RT-PCR revealed that cultured chondrocytes expressed mRNAs of inhibin/activin betaA and four activin receptors (two type I (ActRI and ActRIB) and two type II (ActRII and ActRIIB)). Immunohistochemical analyses showed that activin betaA, ActRI and ActRII were localized in proliferating chondrocytes and osteoblasts in tibiae of neonatal rats, and in implants of demineralized bone matrix, a well-established model of ectopic bone formation. The immunoreactivities of osteoblasts were decreased with aging in the tibiae and with progressing endochondral bone development in the implants. The strong expression of ActRI was also detected in hypertrophic chondrocytes both in the tibial growth plate and in the implants, whereas immunoreactive ActRII was lower in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Western blot analysis also showed that immunoreactive ActRI, migrating at 52 kDa, was detected only in the implants on days 9 and 11, the period of conversion from cartilage to bone. In view of the sharing of type II receptors between activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), our findings suggest that activin/BMP activity involves in bone modeling, especially during active chondro- and osteogenesis and during the conversion from cartilage to bone.

8910236|a|1. Since direct measurement of muscle blood flow in humans has been difficult, estimations of muscle flow have been made from measured total limb blood flow using a classic equation that predicts that the fraction of resting blood flow through muscle tissue decreases as total limb flow increases. 2. We used positron emission tomography and 15O-labelled water to directly quantify resting muscle and total limb blood flow in cross-sections of the femoral region in twenty-eight normal subjects (age, 30 +/- 8 years; body mass index, 24.1 +/- 3.3 Kg m-2) under conditions of constant environmental temperature of 22-23 degrees C. 3. Muscle blood flow averaged 3.1 +/- 1.7 ml (100 ml muscle)-1 min-1 (range, 1.1-7.5 ml (100 ml muscle)-1 min-1 and cross-sectional limb blood flow averaged 2.5 +/- 1.1 ml (100 ml limb)-1 min-1) (range, 1.0-4.8 ml (100 ml limb)-1 min-1). A linear relationship was observed between limb and muscle blood flow, and a regression equation was calculated for estimation of muscle blood flow bases on limb flow: muscle flow = (1.41 +/- 0.10) limb flow - (0.43 +/- 0.28). The slope of this equation was significantly greater than 1 (P < 0.001) indicating that the fraction of blood flow perfusing muscle tissue increases as a function of total limb flow. 4. These data provide a new equation for estimation of resting muscle blood flow in normal subjects, and demonstrate that muscle blood flow is the primary determinant of resting blood flow in man.

15869916|a|Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells with a capacity to form bone tissue in vivo, and to differentiate into the osteoblastic lineage in vitro. Drawing on evidence that bone is mechanosensitive and mechanical stimuli are anabolic, we postulate that proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs may be stimulated by mechanical forces. In this study, BMSCs cultured in the presence of osteogenic factors (dexamethasone, beta-glycerophosphate, and ascorbate) were stimulated repeatedly (every second day) with shearing flow (1.6 dyn/cm(2)) for 5, 30, or 120 min, and assayed for systematic changes in cell number and phenotypic markers of osteoblastic differentiation. Cells exposed to fluid flow on days 2 and 4 after the addition of osteogenic factors and assayed at day 6 exhibited a modest decrease in cell number and increase in normalized alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting the detachment of a non-osteogenic subpopulation. Cells exposed to fluid flow on days 6, 8, 10, and 12 and assayed at day 20 demonstrated maximal expression of osteopontin and bone sialoprotein mRNA with 30 min duration of flow. Concurrently, at day 20 expression of the adipogenic marker, lipoprotein lipase, was minimal with a 120-min duration of flow. These results indicate that repeated application of shear stress stimulates late phenotypic markers of osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs in a manner that depends on the duration of stimulus. Finally, accumulation of prostaglandin E(2) in culture medium in response to shearing flow systematically decreased with repeated exposure to 30 and 120 min of shear stress (from day 6 to day 12), suggesting an adaptation of the cells to fluid flow.

A 30-min steady fluid shear of 20 dynes/cm(2) increased [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and alkaline phosphatase activity and up-regulated the expression of early mechanoresponsive genes (integrin beta1 (Igtb1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)) in B6 but not C3H osteoblasts, indicating that the differential mechanosensitivity was intrinsic to osteoblasts. In-house microarray analysis with 5,500 gene fragments revealed that the expression of 669 genes in B6 osteoblasts and 474 genes in C3H osteoblasts was altered 4 h after the fluid shear. Several genes associated with the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, the estrogen receptor (ER), the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor-beta, and Wnt pathways were differentially up-regulated in B6 osteoblasts. In vitro mechanical loading also led to up-regulation of these genes in the bones of B6 but not C3H mice. Pretreatment of B6 osteoblasts with inhibitors of the Wnt pathway (endostatin), the BMP pathway (Noggin), or the ER pathway (ICI182780) blocked the fluid shear-induced proliferation. Inhibition of integrin and Cox-2 activation by echistatin and indomethacin, respectively, each blocked the fluid shear-induced up-regulation of genes associated with these four pathways. In summary, up-regulation of the IGF-I, ER, BMP, and Wnt pathways is involved in mechanotransduction. These four pathways are downstream to the early mechanoresponsive genes, i.e. Igtb1 and Cox-2. In conclusion, differential up-regulation of these anabolic pathways may in part contribute to the good and poor response, respectively, in the B6 and C3H mice to mechanical loading.

11918224|a|Skeletal unloading induced by hindlimb suspension in rats reduces bone formation and induces osteopenia, but its effect on adipogenesis is unknown. We assessed the effects of unloading and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta2 on bone marrow stromal cell adipocyte differentiation in relation with osteoblast differentiation. Skeletal unloading rapidly (4-7 days) decreased osteoblast transcription factor Runx2, osteocalcin (OC), and type I collagen messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and reduced bone formation in the long bone metaphysis. Conversely, unloading increased expression of the adipocyte transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARgamma2) at 4 days and increased expression of the adipocyte differentiation genes lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and aP2 in the bone marrow stroma at 7 days. Consistently, unloading increased the number and volume of adipocytes in the bone marrow stroma. Continuous (0-7 days) and late (4-7 days) treatments with TGF-beta2 corrected the abnormal expression of Cbfa1/Runx2, OC, and type I collagen mRNAs and normalized bone formation in unloaded metaphyseal bone. Moreover, both TGF-beta2 treatments decreased PPARy2 and C/EBPalpha mRNA levels at 4 days and normalized aP2 and LPL expression and adipocyte number and volume at 7 days. These results show that skeletal unloading increases adipocyte differentiation concomitantly with inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. These abnormalities are prevented and reversed by TGF-beta2, suggesting a role for TGF-beta in the control of adipogenic differentiation in the bone marrow stroma.

14517293|a|Myostatin, a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family member, is a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. In this study we characterized the myostatin signal transduction pathway and examined its effect on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-induced adipogenesis. While both BMP7 and BMP2 activated transcription from the BMP-responsive I-BRE-Lux reporter and induced adipogenic differentiation, myostatin inhibited BMP7- but not BMP2-mediated responses. To dissect the molecular mechanism of this antagonism, we characterized the myostatin signal transduction pathway. We showed that myostatin binds the type II Ser/Thr kinase receptor. ActRIIB, and then partners with a type I receptor, either activin receptor-like kinase 4 (ALK4 or ActRIB) or ALK5 (TbetaRI), to induce phosphorylation of Smad2/Smad3 and activate a TGF-beta-like signaling pathway. We demonstrated that myostatin prevents BMP7 but not BMP2 binding to its receptors and that BMP7-induced heteromeric receptor complex formation is blocked by competition for the common type II receptor, ActRIIB. Thus, our results reveal a strikingly specific antagonism of BMP7-mediated processes by myostatin and suggest that myostatin is an important regulator of adipogenesis.

11237745|a|Myostatin, a new TGF-beta family member, is known as a muscle growth inhibitor, but its role in adipocyte development has not been studied. To test the role of Myostatin in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation, we treated cultured 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with Myostatin dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) during differentiation after they had become confluent. Myostatin treatment significantly decreased glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity and oil Red-O staining compared to controls that did not receive Myostatin. Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) were significantly decreased by Myostatin treatment (P < 0.05). However, the expression of C/EBP beta was not significantly changed by the treatment (P > 0.05). From RT-PCR result, the relative level of leptin mRNA in Myostatin-treated cells was not significantly different (P > 0.1) from the level in cells without Myostatin treatment. Our data show that Myostatin, a secreted protein from muscle, inhibits preadipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells, which is mediated, in part, by altered regulation of C/EBP alpha and PPAR gamma.

11708718|a|Aging of the human skeleton is characterized by decreased bone formation and bone mass and these changes are more pronounced in patients with osteoporosis. As osteoblasts and adipocytes share a common precursor cell in the bone marrow, we hypothesized that decreased bone formation observed during aging and in patients with osteoporosis is the result of enhanced adipognesis versus osteoblastogenesis from precursor cells in the bone marrow. Thus, we examined iliac crest bone biopsies obtained from 53 healthy normal individuals (age 30-100) and 26 patients with osteoporosis (age 52-92). Adipose tissue volume fraction (AV), hematopoietic tissue volume fraction (HV) and trabecular bone volume fraction (BV) were quantitated as a percentage of total tissue volume fraction (TV) (calculated as BV + AV + HV) using the point-counting method. We found an age-related increase in AV/TV (r = 0.53, P < 0.001, n = 53) and an age-related decline in BV/TV (r = -0.46, P < 0.001, n = 53) as well as in the HV/TV (r -0.318, P < 0.05, n = 53). There was an age-related inverse correlation between BV/TV and AV/TV (r = -0.58, P < 0.001). No significant correlation between the AV/TV and the body mass index (r = 0.06, n.s., n = 52) was detectable. Compared with age-matched controls, patients with osteoporosis exhibited an increased AV/TV (P < 0.05) and decreased BV/TV (P < 0.05) but no statistically significant difference in HV/TV. Our data support the hypothesis that with aging and in osteoporosis an enhanced adipogenesis is observed in the bone marrow and that these changes are inversely correlated to decreased trabecular bone volume. The cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating these changes remain to be determined.

12195001|a|Preliminary studies have suggested that there is an increase in adipocytic tissue in osteoporotic (OP) bone, supporting in vitro evidence for a switch in differentiation of stromal cells from the osteoblastic to the adipocytic lineage. To investigate this the variation of the ratio of adipose tissue to haemopoietic/stromal tissue in OP bone was measured.The ratio of adipocytic to haemopoietic/stromal tissue (A/H) was measured by semi-automated image analysis in iliac crest biopsies from 127 patients with osteoporosis (84 female patients, 48 male patients; mean age, 55 years; range, 5-80). Fourteen patients with normal histomorphometric data (nine women; five men; mean age, 48 years; range 21-70) acted as controls.The ratio of A/H was higher in OP bone than in the normal controls (OP mean 43.06% v normal mean 22.4%; p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that 98.5% of the variability in the A/H ratio was the result of age and several measures of bone formation, including cancellous wall thickness, osteoid volume, cancellous thickness, cortical wall thickness, cancellous apposition rate, and bone formation rate, together with cancellous separation (each significant at p < 0.001). Those with the greatest effect on the A/H ratio (in decreasing order) were cancellous apposition rate, osteoid volume, and age.Cancellous apposition rate, osteoid volume, and age were associated with the increase in the proportion of adipose tissue present in OP bone. Of these, cancellous apposition rate reflects osteoblast activity, indicating that the increase in the volume of adipose tissue in osteoporosis is associated with reduced bone formation, supporting the postulated switch in differentiation of stromal cells from the osteoblastic to the adipocytic pathway in osteoporosis.

11685433|a|Aging is associated with decreased trabecular bone mass and increased adipocyte formation in bone marrow. As osteoblasts and adipocytes share common precursor cells present in the bone marrow stroma, it has been proposed that an inverse relationship exists between adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied mice treated with troglitazone (n = 9) given as a 0.2% of food admixture (2.0 g troglitazone per kg food) for 10 months and control mice (n = 9). Troglitazone is a potent stimulator of adipogenesis acting at the nuclear receptor: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). Histomorphometric analysis of proximal tibia was performed in order to quantitate the amount of trabecular bone volume per total volume (BV/TV %), adipose tissue volume per total volume (AV/TV %), and hematopoietic marrow volume per total volume (HV/TV %) using the point-counting technique. Bone size did not differ between the two groups. In troglitazone-treated mice, AV/TV was significantly higher than in control mice (4.7+/-2.1% vs. 0.2+/-0.3%, respectively, mean +/- SD, P < 0.001). BV/TV was similar in the two groups (16.9+/-5.6% for troglitazone-treated group vs. 14.9+/-4.7% for control group) as well as ash weight of the vertebrae. HV/TV was reduced in troglitazone-treated mice compared with control mice (78.4+/-6.8% vs. 84.9+/-4.7%, respectively, P < 0.05) and the presence of vascular sinusoids was reduced (7.3+/-1.7% vs. 16.1+/-5.6%, respectively, P < 0.05). Our data demonstrate that adipogenesis and osteogenesis can be regulated independently. Troglitazone-induced adipogenesis in the bone marrow may be caused by changes in the bone marrow vascularity.

2064840|a|It is known that marrow fat content increases in a variety of osteoporoses. This study sought to clarify this phenomenon by combining bone and marrow histomorphometry, and to determine (1) whether the marrow fat increase follows or precedes diminishment of bone volume, and (2) whether the increase in fat volume is due to adipocyte growth or proliferation. The relationship between marrow fat content and bone turnover was studied in the metaphysis and epiphysis of the proximal tibia in 20 ovariectomized and 20 intact 200 gm Sprague-Dawley rats. The results were examined after one and three months. The epiphysis had greater trabecular bone volume than the metaphysis. The metaphysis exhibited a decrease in bone volume with time; the epiphysis did not. Following ovariectomy, the bone volume diminished twice as much in the metaphysis as in the epiphysis. In the epiphysis, as bone volume fraction fell following ovariectomy, the vacated space was filled by both hemopoietic and adipose tissue. In the metaphysis, space-filling was time-dependent: hemopoietic tissue at one month and adipose tissue at three months. Marrow fat content increased with both time and ovariectomy in the metaphysis, but only with time in the epiphysis. Thus, marrow fat increased after bone volume began to decline in the metaphysis, and not at all in the epiphysis. Ovariectomy increased erosion surface in both the epiphysis and the metaphysis, but bone formation rate was increased only in the epiphysis. There was a reciprocal relationship between marrow fat content and bone formation rate.

12618358|a|Myostatin inhibits myogenesis. Therefore, we sought to determine if mice lacking the myostatin gene [Mstn(-/-)] would lose less muscle mass than wild-type mice during 7 days of hindlimb suspension (HS). Male Mstn(-/-) and wild-type (C57) mice were subjected to HS or served as ground-based controls (n = 6/group). Wild-type mice lost 8% of body mass and approximately 13% of wet mass from biceps femoris, quadriceps femoris, and soleus, whereas the mass of extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was unchanged after HS. Unexpectedly, Mstn(-/-) mice lost more body (13%, P < 0.05) and quadriceps femoris (17%, P < 0.05) mass than wild-type mice and lost 33% of EDL mass (P < 0.01) after HS. Protein expression of myostatin in biceps femoris and quadriceps femoris was not altered, whereas expression of MyoD, Myf-5, and myogenin increased in wild-type mice and tended to decrease in muscles of Mstn(-/-) mice. These data suggest that HS induced myogenesis in wild-type mice to counter atrophy, whereas myogenesis was not induced in Mstn(-/-) mice, thereby resulting in a greater loss of muscle mass.

8468455|a|This study characterized histochemically three fast fiber types (IIB, IID, IIA) in skeletal muscles of mouse, rat, and rabbit, with special reference to fiber types IIB and IID. The results are complemented by biochemical analyses of myosin heavy chain composition in these muscles. Fiber type delineation is based on various methods for mATPase staining with pre-incubations and assays under different conditions. In rat and mouse, IIB and IID fibers can be best distinguished according to their different mATPase stabilities towards formaldehyde and alkaline pH. In rabbit, the method of Matoba and Gollnick using acid pre-incubation provided best and most reproducible results. In addition to their different mATPase stabilities, the three fast fiber types differ with regard to their oxidative capacities and cross-sectional fiber areas in the three species. In general, Type IIB fibers are the largest and least oxidative, Type IIA fibers the smallest and most oxidative, and Type IID fibers intermediate. In rabbit, Type IID fibers are the predominant fast fiber population in extensor digitorum longus, psoas, and tibialis anterior muscles. As judged from histochemistry, these muscles of rabbit do not contain pure Type IIB fibers. This is in accordance with biochemical results that show the HCIId to form the majority of the myosin heavy chain complement expressed in these muscles. On the other hand, IIB fibers are numerous in rabbit adductor magnus, gastrocnemius, and vastus lateralis muscles. Similarly, appreciable amounts of myosin heavy chain HCIIb are found in the three latter muscles of rabbit.

2179205|a|The unweighting model is a unique whole animal model that will permit the future delineation of the mechanism(s) by which gravity maintains contractile mass in postural (slow-twitch) skeletal muscle. Since the origination of the model of rodent hindlimb unweighting almost one decade ago, about half of the 59 refereed articles in which this model was utilized have been published in the Journal of Applied Physiology. Thus the purpose of this review is to provide, for those researchers with an interest in the hindlimb unweighting model, a summation of the data derived from this model to data and hopefully to stimulate research interest in aspects of the model for which data are lacking. The stress response of the animal to hindlimb unweighting is transient, minimal in magnitude, and somewhat variable. After 1 wk of unweighting, the animal exhibits no chronic signs of stress. The atrophy of the soleus muscle, a predominantly slow-twitch muscle, is emphasized because unweighting preferentially affects it compared with other calf muscles, which are mainly fast-twitch muscles. The review considers the following information about the unweighted soleus muscle: electromyogram activity, amount and type of protein lost, capillarization, oxidative capacity, glycolytic enzyme activities, fiber cross section, contractile properties, glucose uptake, sensitivity to insulin, protein synthesis and degradation rates, glucocorticoid receptor numbers, responses of specific mRNAs, and changes in metabolite concentrations.

15084967|a|Great efforts have been devoted to detecting preinvasive precursors to ductal carcinoma of the pancreas in the hope of improving the currently bleak prognosis of invasive pancreatic cancer. Intensive investigations of the pancreas have led to the recognition of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and the detection of preinvasive precursors to conventional ductal carcinoma. The pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) nomenclature for precursor lesions of ductal carcinoma was developed at the "Pancreatic Cancer Think Tank" held in the United States in 1999. However, some reports of precursor lesions have suggested that these definitions do not encompass the full spectrum of precursors of ductal carcinoma, and these issues were the subject of the "Forum on Carcinoma In Situ of the Pancreas" held in Japan in 2002. After this forum, it became clear that the existing definitions of PanINs needed to be revised and expanded. Both participants of the Pancreatic Cancer Think Tank and the Forum gathered together at a meeting on precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer in 2003, and an international consensus on the diagnostic criteria for PanINs and IPMNs was created. We describe herein the current understanding of precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer.

11902541|a|A key challenge in cancer control and prevention is detection of the disease as early as possible, enabling effective interventions and therapies to contribute to reduction in mortality and morbidity. Biomarkers are important as molecular signposts of the physiological state of a cell at a specific time. Active genes, their respective protein products, and other organic chemicals made by the cell create these signposts. As a normal cell progresses through the complex process of transformation to a cancerous state, biomarkers could prove vital for the identification of early cancer and people at risk of developing cancer. We discuss current research into the genetic and molecular signatures of cells, including microsatellite instability, hypermethylation and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The use of genomic and proteomic high-throughput technology platforms to facilitate detection of early cancer by means of biomarkers, and issues on the analysis, validation, and predictive value of biomarkers based on these technologies are also discussed. We report on recent advances in identifying sources of biomarkers that can be accessed by noninvasive techniques, such as buccal-cell isolates, as well as traditional sources such as serum or plasma. We also focus on the work of the Early Detection Research Network at the National Cancer Institute, harnessing expertise from leading national and international institutions, to identify and validate biomarkers for the detection of precancerous and cancerous cells in assessing risk of cancer. The network also has a role in linking discovery to process development, resulting in early detection tests and clinical assessment.

In the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene trial, eligible women are at least 35 years of age and postmenopausal, with either lobular carcinoma in situ or a 5-year risk of invasive breast cancer of at least 1.67%. The study will compare the ability of 5 years of tamoxifen or raloxifene to reduce the incidence of breast cancer. Subjects are randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg of tamoxifen or 60 mg of raloxifene daily. After 3 years of recruitment, 13647 women have been randomized (20.7% of those eligible). The median age of randomized women is 58 years (mean age, 58 years), and their median 5-year risk of breast cancer is 3.3% (mean 5-year risk of breast cancer, 4.0%). Hysterectomy was reported by 52.5% of the randomized women; lobular carcinoma in situ was reported by 8.4% of subjects before randomization. In the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-24 trial, 1804 women with ductal carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned tamoxifen after lumpectomy and radiation therapy. Women in the tamoxifen group had fewer breast cancer events at 5 years than did those on placebo (8.2% versus 13.4%, P = 0.0009). The proposed NSABP B-35 trial will have the same design as NSABP B-24 but will compare tamoxifen with anastrozole in postmenopausal women.

1277176|a|In 227 cases of human pancreas cancer (100 pancreatectomy specimens and 127 autopsies), pancreas duct epithelium not involved by invasive cancer was examined. Pancreas duct epithelium from 100 autopsies of patients with nonpancreatic cancer, matched by age and sex to the pancreas cancer autopsy cases, was used for control studies. The prevalence of squamous metaplasia, pyloric gland metaplasia, mucous hypertrophy, and focal epithelial hyperplasia was not greatly different in the two groups. Ductal papillary hyperplasia was three times more prevalent in pancrease cancer than in controls. Marked atypia occurred in 20%, and carcinoma in situ, in 18% of the pancreas cancer cases, but neither change was seen in the control cases. It is possible that focal epithelial hyperplasia was a precursor change but that it was overgrown by the cancer. Papillary hyperplasia could not be properly evaluated as a precursor lesion because of duct obstruction, but practically all cases of marked atypia and carcinoma in situ occurred in papillary lesions. Marked atypia and carcinoma in situ, by analogy to other cancers, would appear to be precursor lesions, and their presence in association with invasive cancer lends hope to the possibility that there is a significant, recognizable, in situ phase of the disease before invasive cancer occurs.

445339|a|In order to find a relationship between ductal hyperplasia and carcinoma of the pancreas, histological and histochemical examinations were made on pancreatic specimens of 1,174 autopsy patients with special attention to the age incidence of the former. Ductal hyperplasia was divided into 3 types; nonpapillary, papillary, and atypical hyperplasia. All three types of hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma showed a similar tinctorial property in mucous histochemistry. In general, atypical hyperplasia was seen in the pancreas having papillary hyperplasia which was found in the pancreas associated with nonpapillary hyperplasia. All three types of hyperplasia were apparently more frequent in cancerous pancreases than in non-cancerous ones. They were also more common in the head of the pancreas than in the body and tail. Age incidence also suggests a sequential change from nonpapillary hyperplasia through papillary and atypical ones to carcinoma.

14505145|a|Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is a recently proposed nomenclature for putative precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer, which are designated as PanIN-1 through -3 according to their increasing grade of dysplasia. A stepwise progression model of PanINs has been proposed, and multistep genetic alterations in PanINs are being investigated. PanIN-1A and PanIN-1B may remain unchanged for a long period. PanIN-3 potentially progresses toward invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and there are several case reports suggesting such progression. In these reported patients, PanIN-3 was found in specimens from partial pancreatectomies, and IDC manifested in the pancreatic remnant 17 months to 29 years after the surgery. We describe herein a patient with PanIN-3, in whom IDC manifested in the distal remnant pancreas 69 months after segmental pancreatectomy. Of the reported cases, including the present one, four of the patients were male and three were female, and the age at the first operation ranged from 46 to 70 years. Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor (IPMT) is an entity that is distinct from PanIN. However, IPMTs of small size resemble PanINs morphologically. Loss of Dpc4 expression has been reported in the invasive component of IPMT, as well as in PanIN-3 and IDC. Analysis of mucin expression patterns has been reported, suggesting that, in practice, MUC1-positive MUC2-negative IPMTs may not be distinguishable from PanINs. There may be overlapping lesions between PanINs and IPMTs. Should the paradigm of the ductal origin of IDC be accepted, PanINs and a fraction of IPMTs would represent precursors of IDC.

9500216|a|Pancreata with cancer also frequently have intraductal proliferative lesions, suggesting an association between pancreatic cancer and these lesions. We present three cases in which atypical papillary hyperplasia of the pancreas was documented 17 months to 10 years before the development of an infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The first patient was a 70-year-old woman who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Atypical papillary duct hyperplasia extended to the pancreatic neck margin of resection, but the margin was negative for infiltrating carcinoma. Nine years later, an infiltrating adenocarcinoma developed in the remaining pancreas. The second patient was a 58-year-old man who underwent distal pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis with pseudocyst. Histologic examination showed chronic pancreatitis and multiple foci of atypical papillary duct hyperplasia. Ten years later, the patient underwent a Whipple procedure for infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The third patient was a 46-year-old woman with recurrent pancreatitis who underwent a Whipple procedure. Histologic examination showed atypical papillary duct hyperplasia and chronic pancreatitis but no infiltrating carcinoma. At the time of surgery, the tail of the pancreas was grossly and radiographically normal. Seventeen months later, a malignant pleural effusion developed, and postmortem examination showed infiltrating adenocarcinoma in the tail of the pancreas. In the cases presented, atypical papillary hyperplasia was documented 17 months, 9 years, and 10 years before the development of infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, supporting the concept that there is a progression from intraductal hyperplasia to infiltrating carcinoma of the pancreas, just as there is a progression from adenoma to infiltrating carcinoma in the colorectum. Based on evidence that these intraductal lesions are precursor lesions to infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, we suggest that the term "hyperplasia" be replaced by the more specific term "pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia."

11342768|a|Proliferative epithelial lesions in the smaller caliber pancreatic ducts and ductules have been the subject of numerous morphologic, clinical, and genetic studies; however, a standard nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for classifying these lesion have not been established. To evaluate the uniformity of existing systems for grading duct lesions in the pancreas, 35 microscopic slides with 35 representative duct lesions were sent to eight expert pathologists from the United States, Canada, and Europe. Kappa values for interobserver agreement could not be calculated initially because more than 70 different diagnostic terms were used by the eight pathologists. In several cases, the diagnoses rendered for a single duct lesion ranged from "hyperplasia," to "metaplasia," to "dysplasia," to "carcinoma in situ." This review therefore demonstrated the need for a standard nomenclature and classification system. Subsequently, during a working group meeting, the pathologists agreed to adopt a single standard system. The terminology pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (or PanIN) was selected, and diagnostic criteria for each grade of PanIN were established (http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas_panin). This new system was then evaluated by having the eight pathologists rereview the original 35 cases. Only seven different diagnoses were rendered, and kappa values of 0.43, 0.14, and 0.42 were obtained for PanINs 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Cases assigned other diagnoses (e.g., squamous metaplasia) collectively had a kappa value of 0.41. These results show both the potential of the classification system, and also the difficulty of classifying these lesions even with a consistent nomenclature. However, even when there is lack of consensus, having a restricted set of descriptions and terms allows a better understanding of the reasons for disagreement. It is suggested that we adopt and apply this system uniformly, with continued study of its reliability and use, and possibly further refinement. The acceptance of a standard classification system will facilitate the study of pancreatic duct lesions, and will lead ultimately to a better understanding of their biologic importance.

15252303|a|Invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an almost uniformly fatal disease. Several distinct noninvasive precursor lesions can give rise to invasive adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and the prevention, detection, and treatment of these noninvasive lesions offers the potential to cure early pancreatic cancers. Noninvasive precursors of invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas include pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and mucinous cystic neoplasms. Diagnostic criteria, including a distinct ovarian-type stroma, and a consistent nomenclature are well established for mucinous cystic neoplasms. By contrast, consistent nomenclatures and diagnostic criteria have been more difficult to establish for PanINs and IPMNs. Because both PanINs and IPMNs consist of intraductal neoplastic proliferations of columnar, mucin-containing cells with a variable degree of papilla formation, the distinction between these two classes of precursor lesions remains problematic. Thus, considerable ambiguities still exist in the classification of noninvasive neoplasms in the pancreatic ducts. A meeting of international experts on precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer was held at The Johns Hopkins Hospital from August 18 to 19, 2003. The purpose of this meeting was to define an international acceptable set of diagnostic criteria for PanINs and IPMNs and to address a number of ambiguities that exist in the previously reported classification systems for these neoplasms. We present a consensus classification of the precursor lesions in the pancreatic ducts, PanINs and IPMNs.

15731576|a|Pancreatic cancer, once invasive, is almost uniformly fatal. In order to alleviate the dismal prognosis associated with this disease, it is imperative that pancreatic cancer be recognized and treated prior to invasion. Understanding the morphology and biology of precursor lesions of invasive pancreatic cancer has therefore become an issue of paramount importance. In the last decade, significant progress has been in the recognition and appropriate classification of these precursor lesions, and the current review will focus on our state-of-the-art knowledge on this topic. Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) encompass the three known morphologically distinct precursors to invasive pancreatic cancer. In addition to discussion of the "classic" precursor entities, this review will also address some of the recent diagnostic controversies for these lesions, in particular features that distinguish IPMNs from PanIN lesions. Finally, the potential clinical impact of recognizing these precursor lesions in the context of early detection of pancreatic cancer will be discussed.

15720814|a|Molecular analyses have demonstrated mutations in the K-ras gene at codon 12 in the majority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). In order to determine whether the K-ras mutation rate increases parallel to the grade of dysplasia in duct lesions, we performed a meta-analysis of the studies published between 1988 and 2003 that provide information on K-ras mutations in hyperplastic and dysplastic duct lesions in the pancreas. The described duct lesions were reclassified according to the nomenclature for pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), and the molecular methods for detecting K-ras were reviewed. In PanIN lesions from pancreata of patients with PDAC, there was a stepwise increase in K-ras mutations that correlated with the grade of dysplasia of the PanIN lesion. K-ras mutations were found in 36%, 44%, and 87% of PanIN-1a, 1b, and 2-3 lesions, respectively (trend statistic P <.001). Mutation-enriched polymerase chain reaction (PCR) resulted in higher rates of K-ras mutations in PanIN than plain PCR did. The incidence of K-ras mutations in PanIN lesions associated with chronic pancreatitis (CP) or normal pancreas was low (around 10%). In CP, K-ras mutations were only found after a disease duration of 3 years. The correlation of the incidence of K-ras mutations with the grade of dysplasia in PanIN and the occurrence of these mutations in CP with a duration of more than 3 years underlines the importance of this genetic change for the development of PDAC.

10861425|a|Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is considered to be a risk factor for the development of pancreatic carcinoma. The detection of K-ras mutations in the duodenal or pancreatic juice has been held to be a reliable tool for its early diagnosis. However, K-ras mutations also occur in hyperplastic ductal epithelium, making it difficult to interpret their role in pancreatic carcinogenesis.The study included 30 resection specimens, 15 from patients with alcoholic CP, and 15 from patients with idiopathic CP. The mean duration of disease was 6.8 years. A total of 429 ductal lesions were classified according to the World Health Organization classification (1996) and microdissected. K-ras analysis was performed by means of polymerase chain reaction (45 cycles), constant denaturing gel electrophoresis, and sequencing. Immunostaining was performed with antibodies against p53, Ki-S5, carcinoembryonic antigen, and two types of mucins.The 30 specimens demonstrated all types of ductal lesions. Severe cellular atypia was not observed. A total of 429 ductal lesions were analyzed. Approximately 4.4% of the lesions (19 of 429) from 27% of the patients (8 of 30) showed K-ras mutations, but they were unrelated to the duration or type of CP. Immunostaining for mutated p53 protein always was negative. Increased proliferative activity was noted only in patients with papillary hyperplasia. No patient developed pancreatic carcinoma within a follow-up period of at least 3 years.Ductal lesions in patients with CP exhibit K-ras mutations without additional indications of neoplastic transformation such as severe dysplasia or mutated p53 protein. Therefore, for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, the detection of K-ras mutations should be supplemented by the demonstration of additional genetic alterations or clinical signs of malignancy.

12082617|a|Recent studies on small series of pancreatic cancer (PC) with foci of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), a putative precursor lesion, have shown that multiple K-RAS mutations may coexist in the same neoplastic pancreas. To see whether mutant-K-RAS polyclonality is a common and specific feature of pancreatic carcinogenesis, we investigated a unselected series of periampullary cancers (41 pancreatic, 13 biliary and two ampullary adenocarcinomas). After hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), mutations identified with single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) were confirmed by allele-specific PCR and sequencing. K-RAS codon 12 was mutated in 34 (83%) pancreatic cancers and in 11 (85%) biliary cancers. Multiple distinct K-RAS mutations were found in 16 PC (39% of all cases, 47% of those with mutated K-RAS) and in eight biliary cancers (62 and 72%, respectively). In PC, multiple K-RAS mutations were more frequent (P<0.001) in cancers with (nine of 12, 75%) than in those without detectable PanIN (seven of 29, 24%). Individual precursor lesions of the same neoplastic pancreas were found to harbor distinct mutations. Results show that multiple K-RAS mutations are frequent both in PC with associated PanIN and in biliary cancers, and indicate that clonally distinct precursor lesions of PC might variably contribute to tumor development.

15958547|a|Genetic analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and their putative precursor lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanIN), has shown a multistep molecular paradigm for duct cell carcinogenesis. Mutational activation or inactivation of the K-ras, p16(INK4A), Smad4, and p53 genes occur at progressive and high frequencies in these lesions. Oncogenic activation of the K-ras gene occurs in >90% of pancreatic ductal carcinoma and is found early in the PanIN-carcinoma sequence, but its functional roles remain poorly understood. We show here that the expression of K-ras(G12V) oncogene in a near diploid HPV16-E6E7 gene immortalized human pancreatic duct epithelial cell line originally derived from normal pancreas induced the formation of carcinoma in 50% of severe combined immunodeficient mice implanted with these cells. A tumor cell line established from one of these tumors formed ductal cancer when implanted orthotopically. These cells also showed increased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, AKT, and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. Microarray expression profiling studies identified 584 genes whose expression seemed specifically up-regulated by the K-ras oncogene expression. Forty-two of these genes have been reported previously as differentially overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines or primary tumors. Real-time PCR confirmed the overexpression of a large number of these genes. Immunohistochemistry done on tissue microarrays constructed from PanIN and pancreatic cancer samples showed laminin beta3 overexpression starting in high-grade PanINs and occurring in >90% of pancreatic ductal carcinoma. The in vitro modeling of human pancreatic duct epithelial cell transformation may provide mechanistic insights on gene expression changes that occur during multistage pancreatic duct cell carcinogenesis.

14706336|a|To evaluate the role of oncogenic RAS mutations in pancreatic tumorigenesis, we directed endogenous expression of KRAS(G12D) to progenitor cells of the mouse pancreas. We find that physiological levels of Kras(G12D) induce ductal lesions that recapitulate the full spectrum of human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), putative precursors to invasive pancreatic cancer. The PanINs are highly proliferative, show evidence of histological progression, and activate signaling pathways normally quiescent in ductal epithelium, suggesting potential therapeutic and chemopreventive targets for the cognate human condition. At low frequency, these lesions also progress spontaneously to invasive and metastatic adenocarcinomas, establishing PanINs as definitive precursors to the invasive disease. Finally, mice with PanINs have an identifiable serum proteomic signature, suggesting a means of detecting the preinvasive state in patients.

14681207|a|Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ranks among the most lethal of human malignancies. Here, we assess the cooperative interactions of two signature mutations in mice engineered to sustain pancreas-specific Cre-mediated activation of a mutant Kras allele (KrasG12D) and deletion of a conditional Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor allele. The phenotypic impact of KrasG12D alone was limited primarily to the development of focal premalignant ductal lesions, termed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), whereas the sole inactivation of Ink4a/Arf failed to produce any neoplastic lesions in the pancreas. In combination, KrasG12D expression and Ink4a/Arf deficiency resulted in an earlier appearance of PanIN lesions and these neoplasms progressed rapidly to highly invasive and metastatic cancers, resulting in death in all cases by 11 weeks. The evolution of these tumors bears striking resemblance to the human disease, possessing a proliferative stromal component and ductal lesions with a propensity to advance to a poorly differentiated state. These findings in the mouse provide experimental support for the widely accepted model of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma in which activated KRAS serves to initiate PanIN lesions, and the INK4A/ARF tumor suppressors function to constrain the malignant conversion of these PanIN lesions into lethal ductal adenocarcinoma. This faithful mouse model may permit the systematic analysis of genetic lesions implicated in the human disease and serve as a platform for the identification of early disease markers and for the efficient testing of novel therapies.

The primary carcinomas and metastases demonstrate a high degree of genomic instability manifested by nonreciprocal translocations without obvious telomere erosion-hallmarks of human carcinomas not typically observed in mice. No mutations were discovered in other cardinal tumor suppressor gene pathways, which, together with previous results, suggests that there are distinct genetic pathways to PDA with different biological behaviors. These findings have clear implications for understanding mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, and for the development of detection and targeted treatment strategies.

We found allelic deletions of 9p21-p22 in 85% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Analysis of MTS1 in pancreatic carcinomas (27 xenografts and 10 cell lines) showed homozygous deletions in 15 (41%) and sequence changes in 14 (38%). These included eight point mutations (four nonsense, two missense and two splice site mutations) and six deletions/insertions, all accompanied by loss of the wild-type allele. Sequencing of MTS1 from primary tumours confirmed the mutations. Coexistent inactivations of both MTS1 and p53 was common and suggests that abnormal regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases may play an important role in the biology of pancreatic carcinoma.

9242437|a|The Rb/p16 tumor-suppressive pathway is abrogated frequently in human tumors, either through inactivation of the Rb or p16INK4a/CDKN2/MTS1 tumor-suppressor proteins, or through alteration or overexpression of the cyclin D1 or cyclin-dependent kinase 4 oncoproteins. We reported previously that the p16 gene was genetically inactivated in 82% of pancreatic carcinomas. Nearly half of these inactivations were by intragenic mutation of p16, and the remainder were by homozygous deletion of the gene. Here, we analyzed pancreatic carcinomas for additional mechanisms by which the Rb/p16 pathway might be inactivated. Transcriptional silencing of the p16 gene in association with methylation of its 5'-CpG island was examined by methylation-specific PCR in 18 pancreatic carcinomas. Nine of these were known to harbor an intragenic mutation in p16, and nine had a wild-type p16 coding sequence. Seven of the 18 tumors were hypermethylated, and all 7 were p16 wild-type (P = 0.001). Complete silencing of transcription from methylated wild-type gene sequences was demonstrated. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed normal expression levels of the Rb protein in all carcinomas studied. None of the carcinomas had genomic amplification of the cyclin D1 or CDK4 genes, and none had mutation of the p16-binding domain of CDK4. An additional p16 mutation was identified. In total, the Rb/p16 pathway was abrogated in 49 of the 50 carcinomas (98%) studied, all through inactivation of the p16 gene. Similar results were obtained in an independently analyzed series of 19 pancreatic carcinomas. These data demonstrate the central role of the Rb/p16 pathway in the development of pancreatic carcinoma.

10766168|a|Hypermethylation of CpG islands is a common mechanism by which tumor suppressor genes are inactivated. We studied 45 pancreatic carcinomas and 14 normal pancreata for aberrant DNA methylation of CpG islands of multiple genes and clones using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite-modified sequencing. Using MSP, we detected aberrant methylation of at least one locus in 60% of carcinomas. The genes analyzed included RARbeta (methylated in 20%), p16 (18%), CACNA1G (16%), TIMP-3 (11%), E-cad (7%), THBS1 (7%), hMLH1 (4%), DAP kinase (2%), and MGMT (0%). In addition, aberrant methylation was found in three CpG islands (MINT31, -1, and -2) in 38, 38, and 14% of carcinomas, respectively. Hypermethylation was largely confined to the carcinomas with only three loci (E-cad, DAP kinase, and MINT2) harboring methylation in some normal pancreata (36, 21, and 14%, respectively). Simultaneous methylation of at least four loci was observed in 5 of 36 (14%) pancreatic adenocarcinomas. We defined this subgroup of pancreatic adenocarcinomas as "CpG island-methylator-phenotype positive (CIMP+)." Two of four carcinomas with microsatellite instability harbored promoter hypermethylation of hMLH1, and both cases were CIMP+. Thus, we conclude that many pancreatic carcinomas hypermethylate a small percentage of genes, whereas a subset displays a CIMP+ phenotype.

9788631|a|Pancreatic adenocarcinoma develops from histologically identifiable intraductal lesions that undergo a series of architectural, cytological, and genetic changes. Limited genetic evidence recently suggested that the p16 gene plays a role in the progression of these "duct lesions." Duct lesions were identified in pancreata from 33 pancreaticoduodenectomies performed for infiltrating adenocarcinoma. All of these infiltrating adenocarcinomas were previously shown to contain alterations in the p16 gene or its promoter. Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-p16 antibodies were used for histological immunodetection. One hundred twenty-six duct lesions were identified. Nine (30%) of 30 flat, 4 (27%) of 15 papillary, 37 (55%) of 67 papillary with atypia, and 10 (71%) of 14 carcinoma in situ duct lesions showed loss of p16 expression. These included 30% of the flat lesions versus 53% of the nonflat lesions and 29% of the nonatypical lesions versus 58% of the atypical lesions. For both comparisons, the differences were statistically significant (P = 0.036 and P = 0.003, respectively). Loss of p16 expression occurs more frequently, but not exclusively, in higher-grade duct lesions. These data support the hypothesis that pancreatic duct lesions are neoplastic and that they represent the precursors of infiltrating adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical detection of p16 provides a new technology to study the genetic alterations in and stages of progression of large numbers of morphologically defined pancreatic duct lesions.

14657708|a|Patients with long-standing chronic pancreatitis are thought to be at increased risk of developing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, but the mechanism for this increased risk is unknown. Since increasing evidence supports the notion that infiltrating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas arise from pancreatic intraepithelial lesions (PanINs), we sought to determine if patients with chronic pancreatitis harbor PanINs with alterations in tumor suppressor genes that are associated with infiltrating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We identified 122 patients with a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and 29 patients with a well-differentiated pancreatic endocrine tumor that underwent pancreatic surgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1985 to 1999. PanINs from each resection specimen were identified, graded, counted, and correlated with smoking and alcohol history. The expression patterns of p16 and Smad4 were determined in a subset of PanINs by immunohistochemistry, and the pattern of labeling compared with that seen in PanINs associated with infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the pancreas as identified in prior studies, and to PanINs associated with pancreatic endocrine tumor. Duct lesions were present in 80 of the 122 pancreata with chronic pancreatitis (66%). Of 405 duct lesions identified in the chronic pancreatitis group, 7.6% were reactive changes, 65.5% were PanIN-1A, 18% were PanIN-1B, 7.4% were PanIN-2, and 1.5% were PanIN-3. Within the pancreatic endocrine tumor group, 22 PanINs were identified: 15 PanIN-1A, 4 PanIN-1B, and 3 PanIN-2. There were significantly fewer high-grade PanINs in the pancreata with chronic pancreatitis than in pancreata with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (P < 0.0001). Within the chronic pancreatitis group, the 80 patients with PanINs were significantly older than the 42 patients without PanINs (mean age 57.0 +/- 14.1 years vs. 50.9 +/- 14.7 years, P = 0.01). Smoking history was not associated with PanIN prevalence or grade, but patients who reported a history of excessive alcohol consumption had fewer PanINs (25 of 44 harbored PanINs, 57%) than those who did not (54 of 74, 73%, P = 0.07). In the chronic pancreatitis group, 0% of PanIN-1A, 11% of the PanIN-1B, 16% of the PanIN-2, and 40% of the PanIN-3 lesions showed loss of p16 expression, whereas all of the PanINs from patients with an pancreatic endocrine tumor retained p16 expression. All of the PanINs analyzed from patients with chronic pancreatitis retained normal Smad4 expression. We conclude that a significant minority of PanINs arising in patients with chronic pancreatitis show loss of p16 expression. This alteration, common to pancreatic cancer-associated PanINs, may contribute to the predisposition of patients with chronic pancreatitis to develop pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

15662124|a|Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) plays an important role in the salvage pathway for the synthesis of adenosine. Novel chemotherapeutic strategies exploiting the selective loss of MTAP function in cancers have been proposed. The MTAP gene, on chromosome 9p21, is frequently included within homozygous deletions of the p16INK4A/ CDKN2A gene. Biallelic deletions of the p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene are found in 40% of pancreatic cancers, suggesting that the MTAP gene may be frequently inactivated in pancreatic cancer and that selected patients with pancreatic cancer may benefit from therapies targeting this loss. We immunolabeled six xenografted pancreatic cancers with known MTAP and p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene status and found that immunolabeling mirrored gene status. Loss of expression of both MTAP and p16 was observed only in those pancreatic cancers with homozygous deletions that encompassed both the MTAP and p16INK4A/CDKN2A genes. We then immunolabeled a series of 320 microarrayed infiltrating pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 35 biliary adenocarcinomas, 54 ampullary cancers, and 35 noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Immunolabeling for MTAP was lost in 91 of the 300 (30%) evaluable pancreatic cancers, 9 of 54 (17%) ampullary cancers, 4 of 33 (12%) biliary cancers, and in 1 of 35 (3%) IPMNs. All neoplasms with loss of MTAP labeling also demonstrated loss of p16 labeling. These results suggest that MTAP expression is lost in approximately 30% of infiltrating pancreatic cancers and in a lower percentage of other periampullary neoplasms, that this loss is the result of homozygous deletions encompassing both the MTAP and p16INK4A/CDKN2A genes. Thus, pancreatic cancer is a promising cancer type in which to explore novel chemotherapeutic strategies to exploit the selective loss of MTAP function.

15832197|a|The p16INK4A/CDKN2A (p16) gene on chromosome 9p21 is inactivated in >90% of invasive pancreatic cancers. In 40% of pancreatic cancers the p16 gene is inactivated by homozygous deletion, in 40% by an intragenic mutation coupled with loss of the second allele, and in 10-15% by hypermethylation of the p16 gene promoter. Immunohistochemical labeling for the p16 gene product parallels gene status, but does not provide information of the mechanism of p16 gene inactivation. The methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene (MTAP) gene also resides on chromosome 9p21, approximately 100 kb telomeric to the p16 gene. The MTAP gene is frequently contained within p16 homozygous deletions, producing concordant loss of both p16 and MTAP gene expression. Concordant loss of both p16 and MTAP protein expression can therefore be used as a surrogate marker for p16 homozygous deletion. Here we immunolabeled a series of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions of various histologic grades for the p16 and MTAP gene products using a high-throughput PanIN tissue microarray (TMA) format. We demonstrate concordant loss of p16 and MTAP protein expression in 6/73 (8%) PanINs, including five high-grade lesions and one low-grade lesion. Immunolabeling for both p16 and MTAP protein expression provides a tool to evaluate tissues with intact morphology for p16 gene homozygous deletions. The concordant loss of expression of both genes in PanIN lesions demonstrates that homozygous deletions of the p16 tumor suppressor gene can occur in noninvasive precursor lesions.

8187092|a|Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a major cause of cancer death, and yet little is known about its molecular pathogenesis. We identified p53 mutations in 19 (70%) of 27 primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Most were missense point mutations, and the mutations were distributed primarily within the evolutionarily conserved domains. Transitions predominated over transversions, and many of the transitions were at CpG dinucleotides. Intragenic deletions accounted for 32% of mutations and were associated with decreased survival (P = 0.0016). A review of 1937 published p53 mutations revealed that the occurrence of small (1-2 base pairs) microdeletions varied among different types of human neoplasms and that pancreatic adenocarcinoma had one of the highest frequencies (13% of 47 mutations, P = 0.0036). Many small deletions occurred in iterations of single bases, but this did not fully account for their pattern of distribution, and there was evidence for the involvement of homocopolymer (polypurine:polypyrimidine) tracts. This may represent a more widespread phenomenon, because microdeletions occur in similar sequence patterns in reports of somatic and germ line mutations among genes other than p53.

7931827|a|Immunohistochemical detection of intranuclear p53 gene product may indicate mutation of the p53 suppressor gene on chromosome 17p. We used six commercially available antibodies for p53 immunohistochemistry on 19 archival colorectal neoplasms and compared the results with the mutation status of the p53 gene and 17p allelic deletion status. By Friedman's ranking analysis, use of mouse monoclonal antibody DO7 with Target Unmasking Fluid (TUF) for antigen retrieval was the most sensitive and specific procedure (P < 0.0001). Six of 7 cases with high expression (p53 Labeling Index > 30 per cent using a CAS 200 image analyser) had p53 mutation. Of seven tumours without expression (LI < 1 per cent), six had no mutation and one had a truncating mutation which prohibited nuclear localization of gene product. The low expression group (1 per cent < LI < 30 per cent, n = 5) consisted of three tumours without and two tumours with mutation. The sensitivity of high expression with the DO7-TUF method for p53 gene mutation was 67 per cent with specificity of 90 per cent, predictive value of a positive of 86 per cent, predictive value of a negative of 75 per cent, and efficiency of 79 per cent. This study suggests that immunohistochemistry is valuable for assessing p53 gene mutations in colorectal neoplasms, but further study is needed to elucidate the precise link between immunohistochemistry and molecular genetic alterations.

13679454|a|A multistep model for pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been proposed recently. In this model, well-defined, noninvasive ductal lesions are recognized as precursors of invasive cancer and have been classified under the nomenclature of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or PanIN. Increasing evidence suggests that PanINs represent true neoplasms of the pancreatic ductal epithelium, accumulating histologic and genetic abnormalities in their progression toward invasive cancer. We have constructed a tissue microarray containing 55 PanIN lesions of all histologic grades in order to perform a multicomponent analysis of the pancreatic adenocarcinoma progression model. The protein products of 14 genes encompassing a variety of functional classes, such as tumor suppressor genes (p53, Smad4/Dpc4), oncogenes (beta-catenin), cell cycle antigens (p16, cyclin D1), proliferation antigens (Ki-67, topoisomerase II alpha), and epithelial apomucins (MUC1, MUC2, MUC5), as well as "novel" genes described as differentially up-regulated in invasive pancreas cancer by global microarray expression analysis (mesothelin, prostate stem cell antigen, fascin, and 14-3-3varsigma), were analyzed by immunohistochemistry on the PanIN tissue microarray. Comparison of the results from the current study with previously published data performed on routine histologic sections of PanINs demonstrates that tissue microarrays are a valid platform for molecular analysis not only of invasive cancers but of precursor lesions as well. In addition, this study demonstrates that molecular abnormalities in PanINs are not random but can usually be stratified into "early" changes (e.g., expression of MUC5 and prostate stem antigen, or loss of p16), "intermediate" changes (e.g., expression of cyclin D1), and "late" changes (e.g., expression of p53, proliferation antigens, MUC1, mesothelin, and 14-3-3varsigma, or loss of Smad4/Dpc4). Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of precursor lesions of invasive pancreatic adenocarcinomas using a high-throughput tissue microarray-based approach is a valuable adjunct to designing rational strategies for early detection of this lethal neoplasm.

8553070|a|About 90 percent of human pancreatic carcinomas show allelic loss at chromosome 18q. To identify candidate tumor suppressor genes on 18q, a panel of pancreatic carcinomas were analyzed for convergent sites of homozygous deletion. Twenty-five of 84 tumors had homozygous deletions at 18q21.1, a site that excludes DCC (a candidate suppressor gene for colorectal cancer) and includes DPC4, a gene similar in sequence to a Drosophila melanogaster gene (Mad) implicated in a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-like signaling pathway. Potentially inactivating mutations in DPC4 were identified in six of 27 pancreatic carcinomas that did not have homozygous deletions at 18q21.1. These results identify DPC4 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation may play a role in pancreatic and possibly other human cancers.

10766191|a|Infiltrating adenocarcinomas of the pancreas are believed to arise from histologically identifiable intraductal precursors [pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs)] that undergo a series of architectural, cytological, and genetic changes. The role of DPC4 tumor suppressor gene inactivation in this progression has not been defined. Immunohistochemistry for the Dpc4 protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is a sensitive and specific marker for DPC4 gene status, providing a tool to examine DPC4 status in these putative precursor lesions. A total of 188 PanINs were identified in 40 pancreata, 38 (95%) of which also contained an infiltrating adenocarcinoma. Sections containing these 188 duct lesions were labeled with a monoclonal antibody to Dpc4. All 82 flat (PanIN-1A), all 54 papillary (PanIN-1B), and all 23 atypical papillary (PanIN-2) intraductal lesions expressed Dpc4. In contrast, 9 of 29 (31%) severely atypical lesions (PanIN-3 lesions, carcinomas in situ) did not. The difference in Dpc4 expression between histologically low-grade (PanIN-1 and -2) and histologically high-grade (PanIN-3) duct lesions was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). In three cases, the pattern of Dpc4 expression in the PanIN-3 lesions did not match the pattern of expression in the associated infiltrating carcinomas, indicating that these high-grade lesions did not simply represent infiltrating carcinoma growing along benign ducts. Loss of Dpc4 expression occurs biologically late in the neoplastic progression that leads to the development of infiltrating pancreatic cancer, at the stage of histologically recognizable carcinoma.

12509764|a|Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a rare genetic cancer-susceptibility syndrome that is characterized by congenital abnormalities, bone-marrow failure and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Seven FA-associated genes have recently been cloned, and their products were found to interact with well-known DNA-damage-response proteins, including BRCA1, ATM and NBS1. The FA proteins could therefore be involved in the cell-cycle checkpoint and DNA-repair pathways. Recent studies implicate the FA proteins in the process of repairing chromosome defects that occur during homologous recombination, and disruption of the FA genes results in chromosome instability--a common feature of many human cancers.

15277238|a|Biallelic BRCA2-mutations can cause Fanconi anemia and are found in approximately 7% of pancreatic cancers. Recently, several sequence changes in FANCC and FANCG were reported in pancreatic cancer. Functional defects in the Fanconi pathway can result in a marked hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslinking agents, such as mitomycin C. The functional implications of mutations in the Fanconi pathway in cancer have not been fully studied yet; these studies are needed to pave the way for clinical trials of treatment with crosslinking agents of Fanconi-defective cancers. The competence of the proximal Fanconi pathway was screened in 21 pancreatic cancer cell lines by an assay of Fancd2 monoubiquitination using a Fancd2 immunoblot. The pancreatic cancer cell lines Hs766T and PL11 were defective in Fancd2 monoubiquitination. In PL11, this defect led to the identification of a large homozygous deletion in FANCC, the first cancer cell line found to be FANCC-null. The Fanconi-defective cell lines Hs766T, PL11, and CAPAN1 were hypersensitive to the crosslinking agent mitomycin C and some to cis-platin, as measured by cell survival assays and G(2)/M cell-cycle arrest. These results support the practical exploration of crosslinking agents for non-Fanconi anemia patients that have tumors defective in the Fanconi pathway.

11561603|a|Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the United States and will be responsible for an estimated 28,900 deaths in 2001. Relatively little is known of its etiology, and the only well-established risk factor is cigarette smoking. Studies over the past 3 decades have shown that 4%-16% of patients with pancreatic cancer have a family history of the disease. A small fraction of this aggregation can be accounted for in inherited cancer syndromes, including familial atypical multiple-mole melanoma, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, hereditary pancreatitis, and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. These syndromes arise as a result of germline mutations in the BRCA2, pl6 (familial atypical multiple-mole melanoma), mismatch repair (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), and STK11 (Peutz-Jeghers syndrome) genes. In addition, hereditary plays a role in predisposing certain patients with apparently sporadic pancreatic cancer. Many patients with pancreatic cancers caused by a germline mutation in a cancer-causing gene do not have a pedigree that is suggestive of a familial cancer syndrome. A recent prospective analysis of the pedigrees in the National Familial Pancreatic Tumor Registry found that individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer in multiple first-degree relatives have a high risk of pancreatic cancer themselves. The identification of such high-risk individuals will help clinicians target screening programs and develop preventive interventions with the hope of reducing the mortality of pancreatic cancer in these families.

10793087|a|Patients harboring germline BRCA2 mutations are at an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. We investigated the prevalence of biallelic inactivation of BRCA2 in the presumed precursors to invasive pancreatic ductal carcinomas, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Surgical resection specimens from three patients with germline BRCA2 mutations who developed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were studied. Fourteen PanINs were needle-microdissected from paraffin-embedded tissue. DNA was isolated from these microdissected tissues and amplified by primer-mediated pre-amplification. Loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA2 locus was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and cycle sequencing. The presence of the wild-type alleles was evaluated at the nucleotide positions of the germline BRCA2 mutations. The K-ras gene was sequenced at codon 12 and 13 to confirm the efficacy of microdissection. By histological evaluation the prevalence of PanINs in these patients was not notably elevated. Loss of the wild-type allele of BRCA2 was present in one high-grade PanIN (PanIN 3), but in none of 13 low-grade PanINs (PanIN 1). In contrast, K-ras mutations were detectable in 7 of the 14 PanINs. These results suggest that biallelic inactivation of the BRCA2 gene is a relatively late event in pancreatic tumorigenesis. In contrast to classical molecular progression models of tumorigenesis, the inactivation of the wild-type allele in a carrier of a recessive tumor susceptibility gene may not always be the first somatic event during the molecular evolution of a cancer. The necessity for earlier genetic alterations before biallelic inactivation of a recessive tumor susceptibility gene such as BRCA2 may explain why affected carriers have normal numbers of neoplastic precursor lesions, a relatively low phenotypic penetrance, and late age of onset of pancreatic and other cancers.

7757992|a|Little is known about the somatic genetic changes which characterize pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The identification of acquired genomic alterations would further our understanding of the biology of this neoplasm. We have studied 62 primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas obtained from surgical resections using classical cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods. Clonally abnormal karyotypes were observed in 44 neoplasms. Karyotypes were generally complex (greater than three abnormalities) and included both numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities. Many tumors contained at least one marker chromosome. The most frequent whole chromosomal gains were chromosomes 20 (eight tumors) and 7 (seven tumors). Losses were much more frequent: chromosome 18 was lost in 22 tumors followed in frequency by chromosomes 13 (16 tumors), 12 (13 tumors), 17 (13 tumors), and 6 (12 tumors). Structural abnormalities were frequent. Two hundred nine chromosome breakpoints were identified. Excluding Robertsonian translocations, the chromosomal arms most frequently involved were 1p (12); 6q (11); 7q and 17p (9 each); and 1q, 3p, 11p, and 19q (8 each). Portions of the long arm of chromosome 6 appeared to be lost in nine tumors. To determine whether the apparent losses of portions of 6q are real, four tumors with 6q deletions were hybridized with a biotin-labeled microdissection probe from 6q24-ter. Loss of one copy of this region was verified in three of four tumors. In addition, double minute chromosomes were identified in eight cases. To our knowledge, these represent the first primary specimens of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with cytogenetic evidence of gene amplification.

Allelic losses were nonrandomly distributed across the genome and most prevalent for chromosome arms 9p, 17p, and 18q (>60%), sites of the known tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A, TP53, and MADH4. Moderate rates of loss (at any one locus) were noted for chromosome arms 3p, 6q, 8p, 17q, 18p, 21q, and 22q (40-60%). A mapping of individual loci of allelic loss revealed 11 "hot spots" of loss of heterozygosity (>30%) in addition to loci near known tumor suppressor genes, corresponding to 3p, 4q, 5q, 6q, 8p, 12q, 14q, 21q, 22q, and the X chromosome. The average genomic fractional allelic loss was 15.3% of all tested markers for the 82 xenografted cancers, with allelic loss affecting as little as 1.5% to as much as 32.1% of tested loci, a remarkable 20-fold range. We determined the chromosome location (in cM) of each of the 386 markers used based on mapping data available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and we provide the first distance-based estimates of chromosome material lost in a human epithelial cancer. Specifically, we found that the cumulative size of allelic losses ranged from 58 to 1160 cM, with an average loss of 561.32 cM/tumor. We compared the genomic fractional allelic loss of each xenografted cancer with known clinicopathological features for each patient and found a significant correlation with smoking status (P < 0.01). These findings offer new loci for investigation of the genetic alterations common to pancreaticobiliary cancers and aid the understanding of mechanisms of allelic loss in human carcinogenesis.

11337365|a|The presumed precursor lesions of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were recently classified according to their increasing grade of dysplasia and were designated as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) 1 through 3. In this study, we tested whether molecular genetic alterations can be correlated with this classification and may help to further categorize the various PanIN grades. We determined the frequencies of allelic loss at chromosomal arms 9p, 17p, and 18q in 81 microdissected duct lesions of various PanIN grades, using a combination of whole genome amplification and microsatellite analysis. In addition we examined the p53 and Dpc4 protein expression patterns by immunohistochemical analysis. In PanIN-1, we did not detect allelic losses. In PanIN-2, allelic losses were found in increasing frequency, and were particularly high in those lesions with moderate-grade dysplasia (low grade, 20, 33, and 17%, loss at 9p, 17p, and 18q, respectively; moderate grade, 46, 77, and 58%). PanIN-3 and invasive carcinomas exhibited abundant losses. Abnormal p53 and Dpc4 protein expression was only rarely identified in PanIN-2 lesions, but occurred frequently in PanIN-3 lesions and invasive carcinomas. The combined genetic and protein expression data support a model in which allelic loss is the first hit in the biallelic inactivation of the p53 and DPC4 tumor suppressor genes. In addition, our data indicate that allelic loss analysis may be useful in separating PanIN-2 lesions with low-grade dysplasia from those PanIN-2 lesions with moderate-grade dysplasia, each potentially representing a distinct progression step toward invasive carcinoma.

10854233|a|Genetic alterations of pancreatic intraductal lesions adjacent to invasive ductal carcinoma were investigated. We submitted nine foci of ordinary epithelium, 12 foci of nonpapillary hyperplasia, 12 foci of papillary hyperplasia (pap HP), 66 foci of severe ductal dysplasia, and 27 invasive foci from a total of 10 pancreatic carcinomas for genetic analysis. All foci were individually microdissected and allelic losses of 3p, 4q, 5q, 6q, 8p, 9p, 10q, 11q, 13q, 16q, 17p, and 18q were studied. All invasive and severely dysplastic intraductal foci exhibited loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at more than one chromosomal locus. For each case, allelic loss was frequently observed on 9p (severe ductal dysplasia 90%, invasion 100%), 17p (severe ductal dysplasia 80%, invasion 80%), and 18q (severe ductal dysplasia 88%, invasion 88%). Ninety-four percent of severe ductal dysplasia and 96% of invasive foci had multiple LOH. Seventeen percent of nonpapillary hyperplasia and 33% of pap HP showed LOH. Only one focus of pap HP showed multiple LOH. The patterns of allelic loss identified in severe ductal dysplasia were generally conserved in synchronous infiltrating tumors, supporting the paradigm that infiltrating tumors are clonally derived from severe ductal dysplasia. In eight of 10 cases, however, we found frequent genetic heterogeneity in the intraductal lesion, suggestive of genetic progression or diversion. These findings indicate that invasive pancreatic carcinoma evolves through successive and divergent genetic changes with selection of aggressive subclones in the intraductal component.

12414502|a|A multistep model of carcinogenesis has recently been proposed for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. In this model, noninvasive precursor lesions in the pancreatic ductules accumulate genetic alterations in cancer-associated genes eventually leading to the development of an invasive cancer. The nomenclature for these precursor lesions has been standardized as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia or PanIN. Despite the substantial advances made in understanding the biology of invasive pancreatic adenocarcinomas, little is known about the initiating genetic events in the pancreatic ductal epithelium that facilitates its progression to cancer. Telomeres are distinctive structures at the ends of chromosomes that protect against chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge cycles in dividing cells. Critically shortened telomeres can cause chromosomal instability, a sine qua non of most human epithelial cancers. Although evidence for telomeric dysfunction has been demonstrated in invasive pancreatic cancer, the onset of this phenomenon has not been elucidated in the context of noninvasive precursor lesions. We used a recently described in situ hybridization technique in archival samples (Meeker AK, Gage WR, Hicks JL, Simon I, Coffman JR, Platz EA, March GE, De Marzo AM: Telomere length assessment in human archival tissues: combined telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunostaining. American Journal of Pathology 2002, 160:1259-1268) for assessment of telomere length in tissue microarrays containing a variety of noninvasive pancreatic ductal lesions. These included 82 PanIN lesions of all histological grades (24 PanIN-1A, 23 PanIN-1B, 24 PanIN-2, and 11 PanIN-3) that were selected from pancreatectomy specimens for either adenocarcinoma or chronic pancreatitis. Telomere fluorescence intensities in PanIN lesions were compared with adjacent normal pancreatic ductal epithelium and acini (62 of 82 lesions, 76%), or with stromal fibroblasts and islets of Langerhans (20 of 82 lesions, 24%). Telomere signals were strikingly reduced in 79 (96%) of 82 PanINs compared to adjacent normal structures. Notably, even PanIN-1A, the earliest putative precursor lesion, demonstrated a dramatic reduction of telomere fluorescence intensity in 21 (91%) of 23 foci examined. In chronic pancreatitis, reduction of telomere signal was observed in all PanIN lesions, whereas atrophic and inflammatory ductal lesions retained normal telomere length. Telomere fluorescence intensity in PanIN lesions did not correlate with proliferation measured by quantitative Ki-67-labeling index or topoisomerase IIalpha expression. Thus, telomere shortening is by far the most common early genetic abnormality recognized to date in the progression model of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Telomeres may be an essential gatekeeper for maintaining chromosomal integrity, and thus, normal cellular physiology in pancreatic ductal epithelium. A critical shortening of telomere length in PanINs may predispose these noninvasive ductal lesions to accumulate progressive chromosomal abnormalities and to develop toward the stage of invasive carcinoma.

12641272|a|The majority of malignant tumors exhibit complex genomic aberrations, and it has been suggested that an elevated rate of chromosome mutation is present in neoplastic cells. This chromosomal evolution is probably initiated at a preinvase stage and then proceeds continuously but at variable rates during tumor progression. Even though the initiating events may vary among neoplasms, the end point is often a similar set of cytogenetic and cytological events. These include an excessive shortening of telomeric repeats, disrupting the normal mitotic process and triggering chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge events and gross genomic imbalances. Telomere dysfunction may also cause a failure of cytokinesis, resulting in tetraploidization and the accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes. In turn, this could cause multipolar cell division and gross aberrations in chromosome number. Several well-known cancer risk factors could contribute to these processes. For instance, breakage-fusion-bridge instability can be induced directly by clastogenic substances, whereas papilloma virus infection has been shown to dysregulate centrosome function. A prerequisite for the induction of chromosome instability through these mechanisms is partial inactivation of the DNA damage response and the mitotic checkpoint functions. Also, overexpression of telomerase appears to play a crucial role for moderating the rate of chromosomal evolution.

15489135|a|Epigenetic dysregulation is central to cancer development and progression. This dysregulation includes hypomethylation leading to oncogene activation and chromosomal instability, hypermethylation and tumor suppressor gene silencing, and chromatin modification acting directly, and cooperatively with methylation changes, to modify gene expression. In addition, disrupted genomic imprinting appears to contribute to colorectal cancer risk, and serves as a gatekeeper in Wilms tumor. A cancer predisposing disorder, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, usually arises from epigenetic errors, solidifying the causal role of epigenetics in cancer. While cancer epigenetics has been reviewed extensively elsewhere, the main focus of this review will be to present the view that epigenetics and genetics are complementary in the area of cancer etiology, the focus of this volume. I propose a hypothesis in which epigenetic alterations contribute to tumor progression, but they also increase the probability that genetic changes, when they occur, will lead to cancer initiation. This hypothesis could contribute to a new understanding of the role of environmental carcinogens that may not be fully explained through a purely genetic view or by tests, such as bacterial mutation frequency, that ignore epigenetic factors.

10729832|a|Recently, the concept that epigenetic, as well as genetic, events might be central to the evolution of human cancer is re-emerging. Cancers often exhibit an aberrant methylation of gene promoter regions that is associated with loss of gene function. This DNA change constitutes a heritable state, not mediated by altered nucleotide sequence, that appears to be tightly linked to the formation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin. This epigenetic process acts as an alternative to mutations to disrupt tumor-suppressor gene function and can predispose to genetic alterations through inactivating DNA-repair genes. Dissecting the molecular processes that mediate these methylation changes will enhance our understanding of chromatin modeling and gene regulation and might present novel possibilities for cancer therapy. Methylation changes constitute potentially sensitive molecular markers to define risk states, monitor prevention strategies, achieve early diagnosis, and track the prognosis of cancer.

12000709|a|Pancreatic intraductal neoplasia (PanIN) is thought to be the precursor to infiltrating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We have previously shown that the preproenkephalin (ppENK) and p16 genes are aberrantly methylated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In this study we define the methylation status of the ppENK and p16 genes in various grades of PanINs. One hundred seventy-four samples (28 nonneoplastic pancreatic epithelia, 7 reactive epithelia, 29 PanIN-1A, 48 PanIN-1B, 27 PanIN-2, 14 PanIN-3, 15 invasive ductal adenocarcinomas, and 6 miscellaneous pancreatic neoplasms) were microdissected from 29 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgically resected pancreata, and were analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Fourteen of 15 (93.3%) invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas showed methylation of the ppENK gene and 4 of 15 (26.7%) showed methylation of the p16 gene. Nonneoplastic pancreatic epithelia did not harbor methylation of either gene. The prevalence of methylation of the ppENK gene increased significantly with increasing PanIN grade. A similar nonsignificant trend was noted for p16 methylation. Aberrant methylation of the ppENK gene was found in 7.7% of PanIN-1A, 7.3% of PanIN-1B, 22.7% of PanIN-2, and 46.2% of PanIN-3. Aberrant methylation of the p16 gene was found in 12% of PanIN-1A, 2.6% of PanIN-1B, 4.5% of PanIN-2, and 21.4% of PanIN-3. All but one of the PanINs from the 14 pancreata without pancreatic carcinoma was unmethylated with respect to either the p16 or ppENK gene. Our results suggest that methylation-related inactivation of the ppENK and p16 genes is an intermediate or late event during pancreatic carcinogenesis. Because aberrant methylation of ppENK or p16 was more often detected in similar grade PanINs from patients with pancreatic carcinoma than in those with other pancreatic diseases, it may be a useful indicator of the potential malignancy of epithelial cells of the pancreas.

12432281|a|The recently identified tumor-suppressor gene TSLC1 on chromosome 11q23.2 is frequently inactivated in human non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma by DNA methylation-associated silencing. The aim of this study was to determine if TSLC1 is inactivated in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. We analyzed 17 pancreatic cancer cell lines, 91 primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 46 pancreatic intraepithelial (PanIN) precursor lesions and 15 microscopically normal pancreata for methylation of the 5' CpG island of the TSLC1 gene through methylation-specific PCR. We observed 5' CpG methylation of TSLC1 in 4 of 17 cell lines (24%). In each cell line the aberrant methylation was associated with loss of TSLC1 expression by RT-PCR that was reversible after treatment with the DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'- deoxycytidine. Furthermore, we observed that TSLC1 was methylated in 25 of 91 primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas (27%), and in 2 of 7 highgrade PanIN-3 lesions (29%), but not in low-grade PanIN (0 of 9 PanlN-2 and 0 of 30 PanIN-1) lesions or in normal pancreata (n=15). We conclude that epigenetic silencing of TSLC1 expression through 5' CpG island associated methylation is common in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and is a late event in pancreatic neoplastic development.

Since chemotherapy and radiotherapy have thus far largely failed to significantly improve the survival of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, there is considerable interest in identifying better diagnostic markers of pancreatic neoplasia. Not only could better markers improve the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and allow more patients to undergo curative surgical resection, but also could potentially be used for patients at high risk of developing pancreatic cancer to identify precancerous lesions while they are amenable to cure. A wealth of information has recently become available about gene expression, DNA methylation, and proteomics alterations that occur in pancreatic cancers creating hope that better diagnostic markers of pancreatic cancer will be soon forthcoming.

11950919|a|A growing body of morphological, clinical, and genetic observations suggests a progression model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In this model, pancreatic ducts progress through a series of architectural and cytological changes that define degrees of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Expressed in dividing cells, Ki-67 has been extensively used as a proliferation marker. Its expression in different grades of PanIN has not been well studied. A total of 76 PanINs from 41 patients were histologically graded according to recently established criteria. These PanINs were then immunolabeled with a monoclonal antibody against Ki-67 (Mib-1). Normal ducts and invasive ductal adenocarcinomas were also labeled with the antibody. In 15 normal ducts, only 0.41% of the epithelial cells expressed Ki-67. Ki-67-labeling indices in the increasing grades of PanIN were as follows: PanIN-1A, 0.69%; PanIN-1B, 2.33%; PanIN-2, 14.08%; and PanIN-3, 22.01%. Fifteen invasive ductal adenonocarcinomas showed an average labeling index of 36.99%. The difference in Ki-67 labeling among these groups was statistically significant (P <.0005, Kruskal-Wallis test). This pattern of proliferation provides additional evidence supporting the recently proposed pancreatic progression model. It also correlates well with known molecular changes, such as activating point mutations in the K-ras oncogene and the loss of DPC4 and p16 gene expression. Ki-67 staining may be useful as an adjunct in the diagnosis of precancerous lesions in the pancreas and may provide a reliable way to identify lesions at high risk for the subsequent development of infiltrating carcinoma.

11751405|a|Pancreatic cancer (PC) is thought to develop through a series of duct lesions termed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Characterization of the molecular pathology of these lesions may lead to additional understanding of pancreatic ductal carcinogenesis. We examined the protein expression of four functionally related genes, p21(WAF1/CIP1) (CDKN1A), p53, cyclin D1 (CCND1), and DPC4/Smad4 (MADH4), aberrations of which are associated with PC, within 451 PanIN lesions present in the pancreata of 60 patients. p21(WAF1/CIP1) overexpression was present in the normal ducts of 9% of patients and increased progressively to 16% of patients with PanIN-1A lesions, to 32% of patients with PanIN-1B lesions, 56% of patients with PanIN-2 lesions, 80% of patients with PanIN-3 lesions, and 85% of patients with invasive carcinomas (P < 0.01). p53 and cyclin D1 overexpression occurred predominantly in PanIN-3 lesions (P < 0.01), and loss of DPC4/Smad4 expression occurred predominantly in PanIN-3 lesions and invasive carcinoma (P < 0.01). In addition, p21(WAF1/CIP1) overexpression occurred independently of p53 and DPC4/Smad4 expression within invasive carcinoma and PanIN-3 lesions. Cyclin D1 overexpression or loss of DPC4/Smad4 expression was apparent in 85% of invasive carcinomas but in only 14% of PanIN-2 lesions. These data demonstrate that overexpression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) occurs early in the development of PanIN, before aberrations in p53, cyclin D1, and DPC4/Smad4 expression. p21(WAF1/CIP1) overexpression, independent of p53 and/or DPC4/Smad4 expression, may reflect increased Ras activity, either directly through activating K-ras mutations or as a consequence of HER-2/neu (ERBB2) overexpression, both of which are common in PC and in early events in the development of PanIN. These data support further the current progression model for PC and demonstrate that aberrant expression of key cell cycle regulatory genes may be important in the early development and progression of PanIN.

12842085|a|Notch signaling regulates cell fate decisions in a wide variety of adult and embryonic tissues. Here we show that Notch pathway components and Notch target genes are upregulated in invasive pancreatic cancer, as well as in pancreatic cancer precursors from both mouse and human. In mouse pancreas, ectopic Notch activation results in accumulation of nestin-positive precursor cells and expansion of metaplastic ductal epithelium, previously identified as a precursor lesion for pancreatic cancer. Notch is also activated as a direct consequence of EGF receptor activation in exocrine pancreas and is required for TGF alpha-induced changes in epithelial differentiation. These findings suggest that Notch mediates the tumor-initiating effects of TG alpha by expanding a population of undifferentiated precursor cells.

14520411|a|Activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway by sporadic mutations or in familial conditions such as Gorlin's syndrome is associated with tumorigenesis in skin, the cerebellum and skeletal muscle. Here we show that a wide range of digestive tract tumours, including most of those originating in the oesophagus, stomach, biliary tract and pancreas, but not in the colon, display increased Hh pathway activity, which is suppressible by cyclopamine, a Hh pathway antagonist. Cyclopamine also suppresses cell growth in vitro and causes durable regression of xenograft tumours in vivo. Unlike in Gorlin's syndrome tumours, pathway activity and cell growth in these digestive tract tumours are driven by endogenous expression of Hh ligands, as indicated by the presence of Sonic hedgehog and Indian hedgehog transcripts, by the pathway- and growth-inhibitory activity of a Hh-neutralizing antibody, and by the dramatic growth-stimulatory activity of exogenously added Hh ligand. Our results identify a group of common lethal malignancies in which Hh pathway activity, essential for tumour growth, is activated not by mutation but by ligand expression.

14520413|a|Hedgehog signalling--an essential pathway during embryonic pancreatic development, the misregulation of which has been implicated in several forms of cancer--may also be an important mediator in human pancreatic carcinoma. Here we report that sonic hedgehog, a secreted hedgehog ligand, is abnormally expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions: pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Pancreata of Pdx-Shh mice (in which Shh is misexpressed in the pancreatic endoderm) develop abnormal tubular structures, a phenocopy of human PanIN-1 and -2. Moreover, these PanIN-like lesions also contain mutations in K-ras and overexpress HER-2/neu, which are genetic mutations found early in the progression of human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, hedgehog signalling remains active in cell lines established from primary and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Notably, inhibition of hedgehog signalling by cyclopamine induced apoptosis and blocked proliferation in a subset of the pancreatic cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that this pathway may have an early and critical role in the genesis of this cancer, and that maintenance of hedgehog signalling is important for aberrant proliferation and tumorigenesis.

15753353|a|Invasive pancreatic cancer is thought to develop through a series of noninvasive duct lesions known as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). We used cDNA microarrays interrogating 15,000 transcripts to identify 49 genes that were differentially expressed in microdissected early PanIN lesions (PanIN-1B/2) compared with microdissected normal duct epithelium. In this analysis, a cluster of extrapancreatic foregut markers, including pepsinogen C, MUC6, KLF4, and TFF1, was found to be up-regulated in PanIN. Up-regulation of these genes was further validated using combinations of real-time reverse transcription-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry in a total of 150 early PanIN lesions from 81 patients. Identification of these gastrointestinal transcripts in human PanIN prompted assessment of other foregut markers by both semiquantitative and real-time reverse transcription-PCR, revealing similar up-regulation of Sox-2, Gastrin, HoxA5, GATA4/5/6, Villin and Forkhead 6 (Foxl1). In contrast to frequent expression of multiple gastric epithelial markers, the intestinal markers intestinal fatty acid binding protein, CDX1 and CDX2 were rarely expressed either in PanIN lesions or in invasive pancreatic cancer. Hedgehog pathway activation induced by transfection of immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells with Gli1 resulted in up-regulation of the majority of foregut markers seen in early PanIN lesions. These data show frequent up-regulation of foregut markers in early PanIN lesions and suggest that PanIN development may involve Hedgehog-mediated conversion to a gastric epithelial differentiation program.

11357142|a|The Wnt and Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathways have long been known to direct growth and patterning during embryonic development. Recent evidence also implicates these pathways in the postembryonic regulation of stem-cell number in epithelia such as those of the skin and intestine, which undergo constant renewal. A pathological role for the Wnt and Hh pathways has emerged from studies showing a high frequency of specific human cancers associated with mutations that constitutively activate the transcriptional response of these pathways. This article focuses on Hh and Wnt signal transduction and reviews evidence suggesting that tumorigenesis associated with pathway activation may result from mis-specification of cells towards stem-cell or stem cell-like fates.

11891193|a|Acinar cell carcinomas (ACCs) are rare malignant tumors of the exocrine pancreas. The specific molecular alterations that characterize ACCs have not yet been elucidated. ACCs are morphologically and genetically distinct from the more common pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Instead, the morphological, immunohistochemical, and clinical features of ACCs overlap with those of another rare pancreatic neoplasm, pancreatoblastoma. We have recently demonstrated a high frequency of allelic loss on chromosome arm 11p and mutations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway in pancreatoblastomas, suggesting that similar alterations might also play a role in the pathogenesis of some ACCs. We analyzed a series of 21 ACCs for somatic alterations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway and for allelic loss on chromosome 11p. In addition, we evaluated the ACCs for alterations in p53 and Dpc4 expression using immunohistochemistry, and for microsatellite instability (MSI) using polymerase chain amplification of a panel of microsatellite markers. Allelic loss on chromosome 11p was the most common genetic alteration in ACCs, present in 50% (6 of 12 informative cases). Molecular alterations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway were detected in 23.5% (4 of 17) of the carcinomas, including one ACC with an activating mutation of the beta-catenin oncogene and three ACCs with truncating APC mutations. One ACC (1 of 13, 7.6%) showed allelic shifts in four of the five markers tested (MSI-high), two (15.4%) showed an allelic shift in only one of the five markers tested (MSI-low), and no shifts were detected in the remaining 10 cases. The MSI-high ACC showed medullary histological features. In contrast, no loss of Dpc4 protein expression or p53 accumulation was detected. These results indicate that ACCs are genetically distinct from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, but some cases contain genetic alterations common to histologically similar pancreatoblastomas.

11943721|a|Solid-pseudopapillary tumors (SPTs) are unusual pancreatic neoplasms of low malignant potential that most frequently affect young women. Genetic events contributing to the development of SPTs are unknown. Whereas the more common ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas essentially never harbor beta-catenin or APC gene mutations, we have recently identified alterations of the APC/beta-catenin pathway in other nonductal pancreatic neoplasms including pancreatoblastomas and acinar cell carcinomas. We analyzed a series of 20 SPTs for somatic alterations of the APC/beta-catenin pathway using immunohistochemistry for beta-catenin protein accumulation, direct DNA sequencing of beta-catenin exon 3, and direct DNA sequencing of the mutation cluster region in exon 15 of the APC gene in those SPTs that did not harbor beta-catenin mutations. Immunohistochemical labeling for cyclin D1 was performed to evaluate the overexpression of this cell-cycle protein as one of the putative downstream effectors of beta-catenin dysregulation. In addition, we analyzed the SPTs for genetic alterations commonly found in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, including mutations in the K-ras oncogene and p53 and DPC4 tumor suppressor genes, using direct DNA sequencing of K-ras and immunostaining for p53 and Dpc4. Almost all SPTs harbored alterations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin protein was present in 95% (19 of 20), and activating beta-catenin oncogene mutations were identified in 90% (18 of 20) of the SPTs. Seventy-four percent (14 of 19) showed overexpression of cyclin D1, ranging from 10 to 70% of tumor nuclei. In contrast, no K-ras mutations were present in any of the 20 SPTs, and Dpc4 expression was intact in all 16 SPTs for which immunohistochemical labeling was successful. Overexpression of p53 was limited to only 3 of 19 (15.8%) SPTs. These results emphasize the two distinct, divergent genetic pathways of neoplastic progression in pancreatic ductal and nonductal neoplasms.

11696422|a|Pancreatoblastomas are unusual malignant neoplasms of the pediatric pancreas that may also rarely affect adults. The molecular pathogenesis of pancreatoblastomas is unknown. They are clinicopathologically distinct from adult pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, but their occasional occurrence in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and the case presented here of a pancreatoblastoma in an adult patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) suggests that they might bear a genetic similarity to other infantile embryonal tumors such as hepatoblastomas. We analyzed a series of nine pancreatoblastomas for mutations common to other embryonal malignancies including somatic alterations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/beta-catenin pathway and chromosome 11p, using immunohistochemistry for beta-catenin, 5q and 11p allelic loss assays, and direct DNA sequencing of exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene and the mutation cluster region of the APC gene. In addition, we analyzed the pancreatoblastomas for alterations found in adult-type pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas including mutations in the K-ras oncogene and the p53 and DPC4 tumor suppressor genes, using direct DNA sequencing of exon 1 of K-ras and immunohistochemistry for p53 and Dpc4. Allelic loss on chromosome 11p was the most common genetic alteration in pancreatoblastomas, present in 86% (six of seven informative cases). Molecular alterations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway were detected in 67% (six of nine), including five neoplasms with activating mutations of the beta-catenin oncogene and the one FAP-associated tumor with biallelic APC inactivation (germline truncating mutation combined with loss of the wild-type allele); seven neoplasms showed abnormal nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin protein. In contrast, loss of Dpc4 protein expression was present in only two cases (one diffuse and one focal), and no alterations in the K-ras gene or p53 expression were detected. Our findings indicate that pancreatoblastomas are genetically distinct from the more common pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, but bear a close molecular pathogenesis to hepatoblastomas. In addition, pancreatoblastoma may represent an extracolonic manifestation of FAP.

10070951|a|A large body of evidence suggests that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is important in gastrointestinal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether COX-2 was expressed in adenocarcinoma of the human pancreas. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the expression of COX-2 in pancreatic tissue. Levels of COX-2 mRNA were increased by >60-fold in pancreatic cancer compared to adjacent nontumorous tissue. COX-2 protein was present in 9 of 10 cases of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas but was undetectable in nontumorous pancreatic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that COX-2 was expressed in malignant epithelial cells. In cultured human pancreatic cancer cells, levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein were induced by treatment with tumor-promoting phorbol esters. Taken together, these results suggest that COX-2 may be a target for the prevention or treatment of pancreatic cancer.

15626591|a|Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays a key role in diverse inflammatory conditions. Its cellular levels depend on transcriptional activation by pro-inflammatory mediators. The mechanism by which phorbol esters and cytokines activate COX-2 gene expression has been extensively characterized. Several endogenous molecules and natural products have been reported to inhibit COX-2 expression by targeting at the transcriptional activation induced by pro-inflammatory mediators. This review highlights the importance of C/EBP beta and NF-kappa B in COX-2 transcriptional activation by proinflammatory mediators and as targets of inhibition by endogenous molecules such as melatonin and natural products including salicylate and polyphenols.

15374627|a|Aspirin has been used to control pain and inflammation for over a century. Epidemiological studies first associated a decreased incidence of colorectal cancer with the long-term use of aspirin in the early 1980s. Near the same time the first reports showing regression of colorectal adenomas in response to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac were reported. In subsequent years, the use of other NSAIDs, which inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, was linked to reduced cancer risk in multiple tissues including those of the breast, prostate, and lung. Together these studies resulted in the identification of a new cancer preventive and/or therapeutic target-COX enzymes, especially COX-2. Meanwhile, the overexpression of COX-2, and less consistently, the upstream and downstream enzymes of the prostaglandin synthesis pathway, was demonstrated in multiple cancer types and some pre-neoplastic lesions. Direct interactions of prostaglandins with their receptors through autocrine or paracrine pathways to enhance cellular survival or stimulate angiogenesis have been proposed as the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-carcinogenic functions of COX-2. The rapid development of safe and effective inhibitors targeting individual COX enzymes not only dramatically improved our understanding of the function of COX-2, but also resulted in discovery of COX independent functions of NSAIDs, providing important hints for future drug design. Here we review the fundamental features of COX enzymes, especially as related to carcinogenesis, their expression and function in both animal tumor models and clinical cancers and the proposed mechanisms behind their roles in cancer.

12162677|a|We immunohistochemically examined material from 36 pancreata (adenocarcinomas, 30 lesions; pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia [PanIN], 65; normal pancreatic ducts, 30) for cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) with an automated platform. We analyzed 7 to 10 discrete foci and generated an average percentage of positive cells and average staining intensity for each lesion. These 2 values were then multiplied to create an overall "HistoScore" for each lesion. COX-2 demonstrated considerable heterogeneity of expression between and within cases. The overall average percentage of positive cells in adenocarcinomas was 47.3%; in PanINs, 36.3%; and in normal ducts, 19.2%. COX-2 was expressed in more than 20% of cells in 23 adenocarcinomas (77%), 42 PanINs (65%), and 12 normal ducts (40%). The overall average HistoScore for adenocarcinomas was 6.1; for PanINs, 5.4; and for normal ducts, 3.5. Significant differences in COX-2 expression were demonstrable in adenocarcinomas vs normal ducts, PanINs vs normal ducts, and PanIN 2/3 vs PanIN 1a/1b. In general, the pattern of COX-2 expression increased from normal to PanIN to adenocarcinoma. The up-regulation of COX-2 in a subset of noninvasive precursor lesions makes it a potential target for chemoprevention with selective COX-2 inhibitors.

15980665|a|Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key modulatory molecule in inflammation and neoplasia. Increasing evidence suggests a role for COX-2 in pancreatic cancer (PAC). However, expression of COX-2 in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), the precursor lesion of PAC which is often present in chronic pancreatitis (CP), has received little attention.COX-2 immunostaining was performed on sections of PAC (n = 26), CP (n = 34), PanIN (n = 68) and normal pancreas (n = 11). Sections were also stained for macrophages (CD68), activated pancreatic stellate cells (alphaSMA), and collagen (Sirius Red) as markers of fibrosis. Semiquantitative scoring was based on the extent and intensity of immunostaining.COX-2 expression was increased in PAC compared to normal (p = 0.02) with 89% of cases exceeding COX-2 immunostaining in normal ducts. In PanIN lesions, COX-2 expression increased with escalating severity of the PanIN change (p < or = 0.01). COX-2 expression was increased in PanIN-2/3 compared to normal pancreas and CP (p < or = 0.001). In ducts of CP, COX-2 expression did not differ from that in normal tissue. There was no association between COX-2 expression and clinicopathological variables.The high level of COX-2 expression in PanIN lesions suggests that this enzyme could be a therapeutic target at a non-invasive stage of pancreatic carcinogenesis and feasible for chemoprevention in CP.

15861417|a|Pancreatic carcinoma exhibits a unique genetic profile of mutations that may play key roles in its progression to malignant phenotypes. Constitutive activation of transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a frequent molecular alteration in pancreatic carcinoma, suggesting a possible link between inflammation and cancer. The aims of the current study were to determine the effects of aspirin on pancreatic carcinoma prevention and to reveal a possible mechanism of aspirin-mediated cancer chemoprevention.An orthotopic mouse model with human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines PANC-1, PANC-1/Puro, and PANC-1/IkappaBalphaM was used to study the inhibitory effects of aspirin on pancreatic tumor formation.Aspirin inhibited constitutive NF-kappaB activity in culture and, in turn, decreased the expression of the NF-kappaB downstream target gene, Cox-2, in PANC-1 or PANC-1/Puro cells, without significantly inhibiting the in vitro growth of PANC-1/Puro cells. All animals inoculated with either PANC-1 or PANC-1/Puro cells, and not given aspirin, developed pancreatic tumors, whereas none of the mice injected with PANC-1/IkappaBalphaM cells showed any evidence of pancreatic tumor formation. Animals given aspirin for 6 days before, or at the time of, orthotopic tumor cell injection showed a significantly lower incidence of tumor formation compared with those receiving aspirin 2 weeks after inoculation and controls receiving no aspirin.Aspirin repressed tumor formation by PANC-1 cells in vivo in a prophylactic setting, suggesting a possible mechanism for aspirin's preventive effect in pancreatic carcinoma through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation and a mechanistic link between inflammation and tumorigenesis. Aspirin-mediated antiinflammatory approaches might be an effective strategy to prevent pancreatic carcinoma.

12784993|a|Previous experimental and biochemical studies on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have indicated that MMPs are implicated in cancer invasion and metastases. Studies on the expression of MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in various human cancer tissues have further demonstrated that activation of proMMP-2 mediated by a combination of TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP (the proMMP-2/TIMP-2/MT1-MMP system) correlates well with the progression of most of these cancers such as the breast carcinomas, thyroid papillary carcinomas, gastric adenocarcinomas, oral squamous cell carcinomas and gliomas, whereas MMP-7 plays an important role in the metastases of endometrial and gastrointestinal carcinomas. Although MMP-7 is a typical secreted MMP, a member of transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) captures proMMP-7 on the carcinoma cell membranes through interaction with its propeptide, leading to its pericellular activation. Thus, these results strongly suggest that proteolysis at the cell-extracellular matrix interfaces of cancer cells by the proMMP-2/TIMP-2/MT1-MMP and proMMP-7/TM4SF systems plays crucial roles in the progression of human cancers. In this article, we address the current views on the roles of these MMPs acting onthe cell membranes in human cancer invasion and metastases.

12359768|a|Overexpression of the matrix metalloproteinase matrilysin (matrix metalloproteinase-7) in the mouse mammary gland promotes mammary hyperplasia and accelerates the onset of oncogene-induced mammary tumors. In cell culture models, acute exposure of cells coexpressing Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) to matrilysin induces apoptosis, whereas chronic exposure to matrilysin selects for apoptosis-resistant cells. We now demonstrate that matrilysin promotes resistance to apoptosis in vivo. Matrilysin expression increased apoptosis in the involuting mammary gland of mice that had undergone a single pregnancy and lactation cycle. Premature basement membrane disruption was detected in matrilysin-expressing mice, which could account for the increase in apoptosis. However, multiparous mice, in which the involuting mammary epithelial cells have been repeatedly exposed to matrilysin, show a significant decrease in apoptosis. Mammary tissue from multiparous matrilysin-expressing mice showed decreased FasL expression, suggesting that loss of FasL is at least one mechanism of matrilysin-induced resistance to apoptosis. We propose that matrilysin promotes mammary tumor formation by enhancing the selection of cells that are resistant to apoptosis.

12045257|a|In gastrointestinal epithelium, metaplastic conversion between predominant cell types is associated with an increased risk of neoplasia. However, the mechanisms regulating metaplastic transitions in adult epithelia are largely undefined. Here we show that matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) is expressed not only in the majority of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma specimens, but also in human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and metaplastic duct lesions in human and mouse. In a mouse model of pancreatic acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, MMP-7 progressively accumulates during the metaplastic transition, resulting in a concomitant increase in solubilization of Fas ligand (FasL). Under identical conditions, mice either deficient in MMP-7 or carrying an inactive FasL gene are severely inhibited in development of progressive metaplasia and acinar cell apoptosis. Thus, MMP-7 and FasL influence the initiation and maintenance of metaplastic events in pancreatic epithelium, explaining the observed link between metaplasia and apoptosis in pancreas and other gastrointestinal tissues.

11389052|a|Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) can be used to quantify gene expression in human tissues. Comparison of gene expression levels in neoplastic tissues with those seen in nonneoplastic tissues can, in turn, identify novel tumor markers. Such markers are urgently needed for highly lethal cancers like pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which typically presents at an incurable, advanced stage. The results of SAGE analyses of a large number of neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissues are now available online, facilitating the rapid identification of novel tumor markers. We searched an online SAGE database to identify genes preferentially expressed in pancreatic cancers as compared with normal tissues. SAGE libraries derived from pancreatic adenocarcinomas were compared with SAGE libraries derived from nonneoplastic tissues. Three promising tags were identified. Two of these tags corresponded to genes (lipocalin and trefoil factor 2) previously shown to be overexpressed in pancreatic carcinoma, whereas the third tag corresponded to prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), a recently discovered gene thought to be largely restricted to prostatic basal cells and prostatic adenocarcinomas. PSCA was expressed in four of the six pancreatic cancer SAGE libraries, but not in the libraries derived from normal pancreatic ductal cells. We confirmed the overexpression of the PSCA mRNA transcript in 14 of 19 pancreatic cancer cell lines by reverse transcription-PCR, and using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated PSCA protein overexpression in 36 of 60 (60%) primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In 59 of 60 cases, the adjacent nonneoplastic pancreas did not label for PSCA. PSCA is a novel tumor marker for pancreatic carcinoma that has potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications. These results establish the validity of analyses of SAGE databases to identify novel tumor markers.

11943709|a|Despite several advances in our basic understanding and in the clinical management of pancreatic cancer, virtually all patients who will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer will die from this disease. The high mortality of pancreatic cancer is predominantly because of diagnosis at an advanced stage of disease and a lack of effective treatments. We used the Gene Logic Inc. BioExpress platform and Affymetrix GeneChip arrays to identify genes differentially expressed in pancreatic cancer. cDNA was prepared from samples of normal pancreas (n = 11), normal gastrointestinal mucosa (n = 22), resected pancreas cancer tissues (n = 14), and pancreas cancer cell lines (n = 8), and was hybridized to the complete Affymetrix Human Genome U95 GeneChip set (arrays U95 A, B, C, D, and E) for simultaneous analysis of 60,000 cDNA fragments, with 12,000 fragments covering full-length genes and 48,000 fragments covering expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Genes expressed at levels at least fivefold greater in the pancreatic cancers ascompared to normal tissues were identified. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) libraries (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/) of two normal pancreatic ductal cell cultures (HX and H126) were used to exclude genes expressed in the normal ducts (more than five tags per library). Differential expression of selected candidate genes was validated by immunohistochemical analysis (n = 3), by in situ hybridization (n = 1), and by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (n = 8). One hundred eighty fragments were identified as having fivefold or greater expression levels in pancreas cancer specimens as compared to normal tissue, of which 124 corresponded to known genes and 56 to ESTs. Of these 124 fragments, 10 genes were represented by two or more fragments, resulting in 107 known genes identified as differentially expressed in pancreatic cancer. An additional 10 genes were expressed in the SAGE libraries of normal pancreatic duct epithelium, and were excluded from further analysis. A literature search indicated that 28 of the remaining 97 genes have been reported in association with pancreatic cancer, validating this approach. The remaining 69 genes have not been implicated in pancreatic cancer before, and have immediate potential as novel therapeutic targets and tumor markers of pancreatic cancer.

12651607|a|Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. We used cDNA microarrays to analyze global gene expression patterns in 14 pancreatic cancer cell lines, 17 resected infiltrating pancreatic cancer tissues, and 5 samples of normal pancreas to identify genes that are differentially expressed in pancreatic cancer. We found more than 400 cDNAs corresponding to genes that were differentially expressed in the pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines as compared to normal pancreas. These genes that tended to be expressed at higher levels in pancreatic cancers were associated with a variety of processes, including cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, cytoskeletal remodeling, proteolytic activity, and Ca(++) homeostasis. Two prominent clusters of genes were related to the high rates of cellular proliferation in pancreatic cancer cell lines and the host desmoplastic response in the resected pancreatic cancer tissues. Of 149 genes identified as more highly expressed in the pancreatic cancers compared with normal pancreas, 103 genes have not been previously reported in association with pancreatic cancer. The expression patterns of 14 of these highly expressed genes were validated by either immunohistochemistry or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as being expressed in pancreatic cancer. The overexpression of one gene in particular, 14-3-3 sigma, was found to be associated with aberrant hypomethylation in the majority of pancreatic cancers analyzed. The genes and expressed sequence tags presented in this study provide clues to the pathobiology of pancreatic cancer and implicate a large number of potentially new molecular markers for the detection and treatment of pancreatic cancer.

We performed a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of gene expression profiles obtained from pancreatic cancers to determine those genes most differentially expressed and thus with the most promise for translation into clinically useful targets. cDNA was prepared from 50 samples of normal pancreas or duodenal mucosal tissues, 7 samples of chronic pancreatitis, and 39 samples of pancreas cancer tissues or cancer cell lines and hybridized to the complete Affymetrix Human Genome U133 GeneChip set (arrays U133A and U133B) for simultaneous analysis of 45,000 fragments corresponding to 33,000 known genes and 6,000 expressed sequence tags. Genes expressed at levels at least 3-fold greater in the pancreatic cancers as compared with nonneoplastic tissues were identified. Three hundred seventy-seven Affymetrix fragments were identified as having > or = 3-fold expression levels in pancreas cancer specimens as compared with nonneoplastic tissues, corresponding to 234 known genes. Serial analysis of gene expression libraries (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/) of two normal pancreatic ductal cell cultures (HX and H126) were used to exclude 17 genes with high expression levels in the normal duct epithelium (more than five tags/library). Of the remaining 217 known genes, 75 have been previously reported as highly expressed in pancreatic cancers, while the remaining 142 genes are novel. We used principal components analysis (PCA) to identify the genes among these 217 identified as the most differentially expressed and specific to pancreatic cancer tissues or cell lines. Among the most differentially expressed genes identified by PCA were Mesothelin, Muc4, Muc5A/C, Kallikrein 10, Transglutaminase 2, Fascin, TMPRSS3 and stratifin. The differential expression identified by PCA for these genes indicates they are among the more attractive targets for novel therapeutic targets, tumor markers, or as a means of screening pancreatic cancer samples for information regarding tumor classification or potential therapeutic responses. Our findings were also compared in detail to the previously reported findings of highly expressed genes in other studies of global gene expression in pancreatic cancers. We found that robust changes in gene expression were most often identified by more than one gene expression platform. Forty genes were identified by more than one method (U133 oligonucleotide arrays, cDNA arrays or serial analysis of gene expression), and 6 of these genes were identified by all three methods. Our findings identify a novel set of genes as highly expressed in pancreatic cancer, validate the differential expression of previously reported genes, and provide additional support for those genes most differentially expressed to be translated into clinically useful targets.

12019169|a|To identify new diagnostic markers and drug targets for pancreatic cancer, we compared the gene expression patterns of pancreatic cancer cell lines growing in tissue culture with those of normal pancreas using cDNA microarray analysis. Fluorescently (cyanine 5) labeled cDNA probes, made individually from mRNA samples of nine pancreatic cell lines, were each combined with fluorescently (cyanine 3) labeled universal reference mRNA. The mixed probes of each sample were then hybridized with 5760 cDNA arrays (5289 unique cDNA sequences) printed on individual microscope slides. Fluorescently (cyanine 5) labeled normal pancreas mRNA was also compared with the same universal reference mRNA reference pool. The expression ratios of neoplastic versus normal pancreas cells were then calculated by multiplying the ratio of cancer versus the universal reference mRNA and the ratio of the universal reference mRNA cell versus normal pancreas. For 5289 different genes interrogated by the arrays, 30 of them showed an expression ratio 2 SD from the mean in at least three of the nine pancreatic cell lines studied. To confirm the expression profiles of these genes, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot were carried out for 25 of the overexpressed genes. To verify the overexpression in patient samples, two of the overexpressed genes, c-Myc and Rad51, were selected to undergo analysis by reverse transcription-PCR in frozen tumor tissues and by immunostaining in paraffin-embedded tissue section microarrays. The results of these experiments are in agreement with the microarray data. Potential up-regulated targets of note from this study include urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, serine/threonine kinase 15, thioredoxin reductase, and CDC28 protein kinase 2, as well as several others.

12750293|a|The molecular basis of pancreatic cancer is not understood. Previous attempts to determine the specific genes expressed in pancreatic cancer have been hampered by similarities between adenocarcinoma and chronic pancreatitis. In the current study, microarrays (Affymetrix) were used to profile gene expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (10), pancreatic cancer cell lines (7), chronic pancreatitis (5), and normal pancreas (5). Molecular profiling indicated a large number of genes differentially expressed between pancreatic cancer and normal pancreas but many fewer differences between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis, likely because of the shared stromal influences in the two diseases. To specifically identify genes expressed in neoplastic epithelium, we selected genes more highly expressed (>2-fold, p < 0.01) in adenocarcinoma compared with both normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis and which were also highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines. This strategy yielded 158 genes, of which 124 were not previously associated with pancreatic cancer. Quantitative-reverse transcription-PCR for two molecules, S100P and 14-3-3sigma, validated the microarray data. Support for the success of the neoplastic cell gene expression identification strategy was obtained by immunocytochemical localization of four representative genes, 14-3-3sigma, S100P, S100A6, and beta4 integrin, to neoplastic cells in pancreatic tumors. Thus, comparisons between pancreatic adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer cell lines, normal pancreas, and chronic pancreatitis have identified genes that are selectively expressed in the neoplastic epithelium of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These data provide new insights into the molecular pathology of pancreatic cancer that may be useful for detection, diagnosis, and treatment.

11751476|a|Effective new markers of pancreatic carcinoma are urgently needed. In a previous analysis of gene expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), we found that the tag for the mesothelin mRNA transcript was present in seven of eight SAGE libraries derived from pancreatic carcinomas but not in the two SAGE libraries derived from normal pancreatic duct epithelial cells. In this study, we evaluate the potential utility of mesothelin as a tumor marker for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Mesothelin mRNA expression was evaluated in pancreatic adenocarcinomas using reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization, whereas mesothelin protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.Using an online SAGE database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/SAGE), we found the tag for mesothelin to be consistently present in the mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer libraries but not in normal pancreas libraries. Mesothelin mRNA expression was confirmed by in situ hybridization in 4 of 4 resected primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas and by RT-PCR in 18 of 20 pancreatic cancer cell lines, whereas mesothelin protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in all 60 resected primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas studied. The adjacent normal pancreas in these 60 cases did not label, or at most only rare benign pancreatic ducts showed weak labeling for mesothelin.Mesothelin is a new marker for pancreatic adenocarcinoma identified by gene expression analysis. Mesothelin overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma has potential diagnostic, imaging, and therapeutic implications.

8631275|a|It has been proposed that the Xenopus homeobox gene, XlHbox8, is involved in endodermal differentiation during pancreatic and duodenal development (Wright, C.V.E., Schnegelsberg, P. and De Robertis, E.M. (1988). Development 105, 787-794). To test this hypothesis directly, gene targeting was used to make two different null mutations in the mouse XlHbox8 homolog, pdx-1. In the first, the second pdx-1 exon, including the homeobox, was replaced by a neomycin resistance cassette. In the second, a lacZ reporter was fused in-frame with the N terminus of PDX-1, replacing most of the homeodomain. Neonatal pdx-1 -/- mice are apancreatic, in confirmation of previous reports (Jonsson, J., Carlsson, L., Edlund, T. and Edlund, H. (1994). Nature 371, 606-609). However, the pancreatic buds do form in homozygous mutants, and the dorsal bud undergoes limited proliferation and outgrowth to form a small, irregularly branched, ductular tree. This outgrowth does not contain insulin or amylase-positive cells, but glucagon-expressing cells are found. The rostral duodenum shows a local absence of the normal columnar epithelial lining, villi, and Brunner's glands, which are replaced by a GLUT2-positive cuboidal epithelium resembling the bile duct lining. Just distal of the abnormal epithelium, the numbers of enteroendocrine cells in the villi are greatly reduced. The PDX-1/beta-galactosidase fusion allele is expressed in pancreatic and duodenal cells in the absence of functional PDX-1, with expression continuing into perinatal stages with similar boundaries and expression levels. These results offer additional insight into the role of pdx-1 in the determination and differentiation of the posterior foregut, particularly regarding the proliferation and differentiation of the pancreatic progenitors.

12271305|a|The current arsenal of antiviral agents available to the practitioner is expanding rapidly, such that by the time this article goes to press, new drugs may have already been added. Although the majority of approved drugs have been developed for use in only a few viral infections (eg, HIV, herpesviruses, and papillomavirus), discoveries made in the development of these drugs may lead to antiviral agents effective against other viruses. In addition, new uses for the currently available drugs are under evaluation. This review of antiviral agents discusses the treatments available for viral infections such as herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, human papillomavirus, chronic viral hepatitis, and others.

1788153|a|Various N-substituted 3- or 4-(aminomethyl)benzoate esters of acyclovir were synthesized and evaluated as water-soluble prodrug forms with the aim of improving the delivery characteristics of acyclovir, in particular its parenteral administration. The esters showed a high solubility in weakly acidic solutions and, as demonstrated with the 3-(N,N-dipropylaminomethyl)benzoate ester, a high stability in such solutions, allowing storage for several years. The esters combine these properties with a high susceptibility to undergo enzymatic hydrolysis in plasma. The half-lives of hydrolysis in 80% human plasma ranged from 0.8 to 57 min, the rate being highly dependent on the position (3 or 4) of the aminomethyl group relative to the ester moiety. All esters were more lipophilic than acyclovir in terms of octanol-pH 7.4 buffer partition coefficients. These properties make N-substituted (aminomethyl)-benzoate esters a promising new prodrug type for acyclovir to enhance its delivery characteristics.

15117573|a|A positively charged liposomal formulation for topical administration of acyclovir (ACV) was investigated in comparison with a commercial ACV ointment, by determining the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug in the aqueous humor of rabbits after topical administration. The ointment was tested at two different strengths: undiluted (3.0%) and diluted to the same ACV concentration as the liposomal vehicle (0.12%). A liquid formulation containing ACV plus "empty" liposomes and an isotonic aqueous ACV solution were also tested. The applied ACV dose was 0.18 mg, except for the full-strength (3.0%) ointment, in which case it was 1.5 mg. The ACV liposomal dispersion (LIPO-ACV) produced a significantly higher drug concentration profile in the aqueous with respect the three reference formulations containing the same ACV concentration, and showed a 90-minute plateau. The aqueous humor ACV concentration maintained by LIPO-ACV during the plateau was in the upper range of the ID(50)s (0.01 to 0.7 microg/mL) reported for Herpes simplex type 1. In spite of the much higher dose (1.5 versus 0.18 mg), the area under curve (AUC) produced by the full-strength 3.0% ointment was only 1.6 times greater than that corresponding to the liposomal vehicle. In vitro release tests through a cellophane membrane substantiated the concept that positively charged liposomal formulations owe their efficacy to interactions with the positively charged corneal epithelium.

11337166|a|The skin permeation and partitioning of a fluorinated quinolone antibacterial agent, enoxacin, in liposomes and niosomes, after topical application, were elucidated in the present study. In vitro percutaneous absorption experiments were performed on nude mouse skin with Franz diffusion cells. The influence of vesicles on the physicochemical property and stability of the formulations were measured. The enhanced delivery across the skin of liposome and niosome encapsulated enoxacin had been observed after selecting the appropriate formulations. The optimized formulations could also reserve a large amount of enoxacin in the skin. A significant relationship between skin permeation and the cumulative amount of enoxacin in the skin was observed. Both permeation enhancer effect and direct vesicle fusion with stratum corneum may contribute to the permeation of enoxacin across skin. Formulation with niosomes demonstrated a higher stability after 48 h incubation compared to liposomes. The inclusion of cholesterol improved the stability of enoxacin liposomes according to the results from encapsulation and turbidity. However, adding negative charges reduced the stability of niosomes. The ability of liposomes and niosomes to modulate drug delivery without significant toxicity makes the two vesicles useful to formulate topical enoxacin.

3729337|a|Topical acyclovir (ACV) in polyethylene glycol (PEG) ointment has been disappointing in the treatment of recurrent herpes simplex virus infections in immunocompetent patients. To investigate the possible role of poor drug delivery from this formulation, we studied the penetration of ACV through excised human skin from three vehicles; PEG ointment, modified aqueous cream, and dimethyl sulfoxide. A second antiviral agent, idoxuridine, was studied in the same formulations, and drug delivery through excised guinea pig skin was also assessed for comparison. The delivery of ACV from PEG ointment was very slow for both human and guinea pig skin (drug flux, 0.055 and 0.047 microgram/cm2 per h, respectively). Formulation of ACV in modified aqueous cream and in dimethyl sulfoxide resulted in an 8- and 60-fold increase, respectively, in the flux of ACV through human skin. Idoxuridine behaved similarly to ACV in the three vehicles. The poor clinical results seen with topical use of ACV ointment may be due in part to retarded drug delivery from this formulation.

The antioxidant properties were tested in a model system of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) multilamellar liposomes. The lipoperoxidation was induced by adding Cu2+ ions and tert-butylhydroperoxide. The course of EYPC peroxidation was monitored spectrophotometrically for conjugated diene formation. We found that stobadine prolonged the lag phase and decreased the rate of peroxidation during the lag phase in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, an increase in the rate of peroxidation was observed at low stobadine concentration in the propagation phase. The possible cause of prooxidative action of stobadine is discussed.

12204566|a|To prepare niosomes which have high encapsulation capacity for soluble drugs, starting from Span 60 and cholesterol, an improved method, evaporation-sonication method, was proposed. The corresponding niosomes show a good stability at least 40 days. Colchicine was chosen as a model drug for examining the capsulation capacity of these niosomes. To obtain the highest encapsulation efficiency, several factors including the structure of surfactant, level of lipid, content of drug and cholesterol were investigated and optimized. The inner cause was also discussed. The results indicate that the Span 60 is the most ideal surfactant among four kinds of Span. Furthermore, the release studies of colchicine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in vitro from niosomes exhibited a prolonged release profile as studied over a period of 24 h. The results demonstrated that niosomes prepared in this way not only have high encapsulation capacity but also is expected that side effects of drugs may be reduced. It still suggests that this method may be used extensively in the field of encapsulation soluble drugs.

16353961|a|The aim of the present study was to design a depot delivery system of acyclovir sodium using multivesicular liposomes (MVLs) to overcome the limitations of conventional therapies and to investigate its in vivo effectiveness for sustained delivery. MVLs of acyclovir were prepared by the reverse phase evaporation method. The loading efficiency of the MVLs (45%-82%) was found to be 3 to 6 times higher than conventional multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). The in vitro release of acyclovir from MVL formulations was found to be in a sustained manner and only 70% of drug was released in 96 hours, whereas conventional MLVs released 80% of drug in 16 hours. Following intradermal administration to Wistar rats, the MVL formulations showed effective plasma concentration for 48 hours compared with MLVs and free drug solution (12-16 hours). C(max) values of MVL formulations were significantly less (8.6-11.4 microg/mL) than MLV and free drug solution (12.5 microg/mL). The AUC(0-48) of the MVL formulations was 1.5- and 3-fold higher compared with conventional liposomes and free drug solution, respectively. Overall, formulations containing phosphatidyl glycerol as negatively charged lipid showed better results. The MVL delivery system as an intradermal depot offers the advantage of a very high loading and controlled release of acyclovir for an extended period of time. The increase in AUC and decrease in C(max) reflects that the MVL formulations could reduce the toxic complications and limitations of conventional iv and oral therapies.

Aqueous solubilities in isotonic phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), partition coefficients in 1-octanol/phosphate buffer, and hydrolysis kinetics in rat plasma were determined. The ester prodrugs showed consistent increases in lipophilicity with corresponding decreases in aqueous solubility as a function of side-chain length. The bioconversion kinetics of the prodrugs appear to depend on both the apolar and the steric nature of the acyl substituents. When perfused through the rat nasal cavity using the in situ perfusion technique, acyclovir showed no measurable loss from the perfusate. Nasal uptake of acyclovir prodrugs, on the other hand, were moderately improved. Furthermore, the extent of nasal absorption appears to depend on the lipophilicity of the prodrugs in the descending order hexanoate > valerate > pivalate > butyrate. Simultaneous prodrug cleavage by nasal carboxylesterase was also noted in the case of hexanoate.

7510619|a|Aciclovir (acyclovir) is a nucleoside analogue with antiviral activity in vitro against the herpes simplex viruses (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Topical, oral or intravenous aciclovir is well established in the treatment of ophthalmic, mucocutaneous and other HSV infections, with intravenous aciclovir the accepted treatment of choice in herpes simplex encephalitis. The efficacy of aciclovir is increased with early (preferably during the prodromal period) initiation of treatment but, despite significant clinical benefit, viral latency is not eradicated, and pretreatment frequencies of recurrence usually continue after episodic acute treatment is completed. Intravenous administration has also shown benefit in the treatment of severe complications of HSV infection in pregnancy, and neonatal HSV infections. Recurrence of HSV has been completely prevented or significantly reduced during suppressive therapy with oral aciclovir in immunocompetent patients. Use of oral aciclovir is effective but controversial in the treatment of otherwise healthy individuals with varicella (chickenpox), and in some countries it has been recommended for use only in cases which may be potentially severe. The development of rash and pain associated with herpes zoster (shingles) is attenuated with oral or intravenous aciclovir therapy, ocular involvement is prevented, and post-herpetic neuralgia appears to be decreased. Similarly, in a few patients with zoster ophthalmicus, oral aciclovir has reduced the frequency and severity of long term ocular complications and post-herpetic neuralgia, and herpes zoster oticus is improved with intravenous aciclovir. Oral aciclovir has prevented recurrence of HSV genital or orofacial infections during suppressive therapy in > 70% of immunocompetent patients in most clinical trials. Suppression of latent HSV, VZV and CMV infections has been achieved in many immunocompromised patients receiving the oral or intravenous formulations. Aciclovir also appears to offer partial protection from invasive CMV disease in CMV-seropositive bone marrow transplant recipients. The few comparative trials published have shown aciclovir to be at least as effective as other investigated antivirals in the treatment of HSV infections in immunocompetent patients, and more effective than inosine pranobex in the prophylaxis of genital herpes. Similarly, in isolated clinical trials, oral aciclovir appears as effective as topical idoxuridine and oral brivudine in some parameters in immunocompetent patients with VZV infections, and the intravenous formulation appears at least as effective as oral brivudine and intravenous vidarabine in treating these infections in immunocompromised patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

15567316|a|Taxol is a marketed product for the treatment of ovarian, breast, non-small cell lung cancer and AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma. It is thus far one of the most effective anticancer drugs available on the market. However, paclitaxel is only sparingly soluble in water and therefore, intravenous administration depends on the use of the non-ionic surfactant Cremophor EL (polyethoxylated castor oil) to achieve a clinically relevant concentrated solution. Unfortunately, Cremophor EL increases toxicity and leads to hypersensitivity reactions in certain individuals. We have developed a well characterized novel lyophilized liposome-based paclitaxel (LEP-ETU) formulation that is sterile, stable and easy-to-use. The mean particle size of the liposomes is about 150 nm before and after lyophilization, and the drug entrapment efficiency is greater than 90%. Stability data indicated that the lyophilized LEP-ETU was physically and chemically stable for at least 12 months at 2-8 and 25 degrees C. Moreover, the formulation can be diluted to about 0.25mg/ml without drug precipitation or change in particle size. In vitro drug release study in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) showed that less than 6% of the entrapped paclitaxel was released after 120 h, indicating that the drug is highly stable in an entrapped form at physiologic temperature.

15797430|a|Molecular interactions between paclitaxel, an anticancer drug, and phospholipids of various chain unsaturations and headgroup types were investigated in the present study by Langmuir film balance and differential scanning calorimetry. Both the lipid monolayer at the air-water interface and the lipid bilayer vesicles (liposomes) were employed as model cell membranes. It was found that, regardless of the difference in molecular structure of the lipid chains and headgroup, the drug can form nonideal, miscible systems with the lipids at the air-water interface over a wide range of paclitaxel mole fractions. The interaction between paclitaxel and phospholipid within the monolayer was dependent on the molecular area of the lipids at the interface and can be explained by intermolecular forces or geometric accommodation. Paclitaxel is more likely to form thermodynamically stable systems with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dielaidoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DEPC) than with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC). Investigation of the drug penetration into the lipid monolayer showed that DPPC and DEPC have higher incorporation abilities for the drug than DPPE and DSPC. A similar trend was also evidenced by DSC investigation with liposomes. While little change of DSC profiles was observed for the DPPE/paclitaxel and DSPC/paclitaxel liposomes, paclitaxel caused noticeable changes in the thermographs of DPPC and DEPC liposomes. Paclitaxel was found to cause broadening of the main phase transition without significant change in the peak melting temperature of the DPPC bilayers, which demonstrates that paclitaxel was localized in the outer hydrophobic cooperative zone of the bilayer, i.e., in the region of the C1-C8 carbon atoms of the acyl chain or binding at the polar headgroup site of the lipids. However, it may penetrate into the deeper hydrophobic zone of the DEPC bilayers. These findings provide useful information for liposomal formulation of anticancer drugs as well as for understanding drug-cell membrane interactions.

15709761|a|The P23T mutation in the human gammaD-crystallin gene has in recent years been associated with a number of well known cataract phenotypes. To understand the molecular mechanism of lens opacity caused by this mutation, we expressed human gammaD-crystallin (HGD), the P23T mutant, and other related mutant proteins in Escherichia coli and compared the structures and thermodynamic properties of these proteins in vitro. The results show that the cataract-causing mutation P23T does not exhibit any significant structural change relative to the native protein. However, in marked contrast to the native protein, the mutant shows a dramatically lowered solubility. The reduced solubility results from the association of the P23T mutant to form a new condensed phase that contains clusters of the mutant protein. The monomer-cluster equilibrium is represented by a solubility curve in the phase diagram. When the solubility limit is exceeded, the mutant protein forms the condensed phase after a nucleation time of 10-20 min. We found that the solubility of the P23T mutant exhibits an inverse dependence on temperature, i.e., the protein clusters are increasingly soluble as the temperature of the solution decreases. The solubility of P23T can be substantially altered by the introduction of specific mutations at or in the immediate vicinity of residue 23. We examined the mutants P23S, P23V, P23TInsP24, and P23TN24K and found that the latter two mutations can restore the solubility of the P23T mutant. These findings may help develop a strategy for the rational design of small molecule inhibitors of this type of condensed phase.

15451671|a|Mutations in the human gammaD-crystallin gene have been linked to several types of congenital cataracts. In particular, the Pro23 to Thr (P23T) mutation of human gammaD crystallin has been linked to cerulean, lamellar, coralliform, and fasciculiform congenital cataracts. We have expressed and purified wild-type human gammaD, P23T, and the Pro23 to Ser23 (P23S) mutant. Our measurements show that P23T is significantly less soluble than wild-type human gammaD, with P23S having an intermediate solubility. Using synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy, we have determined that the P23T mutant has a slightly increased content of beta-sheet, which may be attributed to the extension of an edge beta-strand due to the substitution of Pro23 with a residue able to form hydrogen bonds. Neither of the point mutations appears to have reduced the thermal stability of the protein significantly, nor its resistance to guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding. These results suggest that insolubility, rather than loss of stability, is the primary basis for P23T congenital cataracts.

9927684|a|Cataracts are a significant public health problem. Here, we describe the genetic alteration responsible for a progressive form of cataract, segregating as an autosomal dominant trait in a three-generation pedigree. Unlike most autosomal dominant cataracts, these are not clinically apparent at birth but are initially observed in the first year or two of life. The opacification evolves relatively slowly, generally necessitating removal of the lens in childhood or early adolescence. A genome-wide search in our kindred revealed linkage at 2q33-35 where the gamma-crystallin gene cluster resides. A single base alteration resulting in an Arg- 14 --> Cys (R14C) substitution in gammaD-crystallin was subsequently identified. Protein modeling suggests that the effect of this mutation is a subtle one, affecting the surface properties of the crystallin molecule rather than its tertiary structure, consistent with the fact that the patients' lenses are normal at birth. This is the first gene defect shown to be responsible for a noncongenital progressive cataract, and studying the defective protein should teach us more about the mechanisms underlying cataract formation.

10688888|a|In a recent paper, patients with a progressive juvenile-onset hereditary cataract have been reported to have a point mutation in the human gammaD crystallin gene (Stephan, D. A., Gillanders, E., Vanderveen, D., Freas-Lutz, D., Wistow, G., Baxevanis, A. D., Robbins, C. M., VanAuken, A., Quesenberry, M. I., Bailey-Wilson, J., et al. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96, 1008-1012). This mutation results in the substitution of Arg-14 in the native protein by a Cys residue. It is not understood how this mutation leads to cataract. We have expressed recombinant wild-type human gammaD crystallin (HGD) and its Arg-14 to Cys mutant (R14C) in Escherichia coli and show that R14C forms disulfide-linked oligomers, which markedly raise the phase separation temperature of the protein solution. Eventually, R14C precipitates. In contrast, HGD slowly forms only disulfide-linked dimers and no oligomers. These data strongly suggest that the observed cataract is triggered by the thiol-mediated aggregation of R14C. The aggregation profiles of HGD and R14C are consistent with our homology modeling studies that reveal that R14C contains two exposed cysteine residues, whereas HGD has only one. Our CD, fluorescence, and differential scanning calorimetric studies show that HGD and R14C have nearly identical secondary and tertiary structures and stabilities. Thus, contrary to current views, unfolding or destabilization of the protein is not necessary for cataractogenesis.

10521291|a|Despite the fact that cataracts constitute the leading cause of blindness worldwide, the mechanisms of lens opacification remain unclear. We recently mapped the aculeiform cataract to the gamma-crystallin locus (CRYG) on chromosome 2q33-35, and mutational analysis of the CRYG-genes cluster identified the aculeiform-cataract mutation in exon 2 of gamma-crystallin D (CRYGD). This mutation occurred in a highly conserved amino acid and could be associated with an impaired folding of CRYGD. During our study, we observed that the previously reported Coppock-like-cataract mutation, the first human cataract mutation, in the pseudogene CRYGE represented a polymorphism seen in 23% of our control population. Further analysis of the original Coppock-like-cataract family identified a missense mutation in a highly conserved segment of exon 2 of CRYGC. These mutations were not seen in a large control population. There is no direct evidence, to date, that up-regulation of a pseudogene causes cataracts. To our knowledge, these findings are the first evidence of an involvement of CRYGC and support the role of CRYGD in human cataract formation.

10915766|a|We describe a 5-year-old boy with a unique congenital cataract caused by deposition of numerous birefringent, pleiochroic and macroscopically prismatic crystals. Crystal analysis with subsequent automatic Edman degradation and matrix-associated laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry have identified the crystal-forming protein as gammaD-crystallin (CRYGD) lacking the N-terminal methionine. Sequencing of the CRYGD gene has shown a heterozygous C-->A transversion in position 109 of the inferred cDNA (36R-->S transversion of the processed, N-terminal methionine-lacking CRYGD). The lens protein crystals were X-ray diffracting, and our crystal structure solution at 2.25 A suggests that mutant R36S CRYGD has an unaltered protein fold. In contrast, the observed crystal packing is possible only with the mutant protein molecules that lack the bulky Arg36 side chain. This is the first described case of human cataract caused by crystallization of a protein in the lens. It involves the third known mutation in the CRYGD gene but offers, for the first time, a causative explanation of the phenotype.

11371638|a|Several human genetic cataracts have been linked recently to point mutations in the gammaD crystallin gene. Here we provide a molecular basis for lens opacity in two genetic cataracts and suggest that the opacity occurs because of the spontaneous crystallization of the mutant proteins. Such crystallization of endogenous proteins leading to pathology is an unusual event. Measurements of the solubility curves of crystals of the Arg-58 to His and Arg-36 to Ser mutants of gammaD crystallin show that the mutations dramatically lower the solubility of the protein. Furthermore, the crystal nucleation rate of the mutants is enhanced considerably relative to that of the wild-type protein. It should be noted that, although there is a marked difference in phase behavior, there is no significant difference in protein conformation among the three proteins.

9223292|a|Prior quasielastic light scattering (QLS) studies of fibrillogenesis of synthetic amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-(1-40) at low pH have suggested a kinetic model in which: (i) fibrillogenesis requires a nucleation step; (ii) nuclei are produced by Abeta micelles in addition to seeds initially present; and (iii) fibril elongation occurs by irreversible binding of Abeta monomers to the fibril ends. Here we present the full mathematical formulation of this model. We describe the temporal evolution of the concentrations of Abeta monomers and micelles as well as the concentration and size distribution of fibrils. This formulation enables deduction of the fundamental parameters of the model-e.g., the nucleation and elongation rate constants kn and ke-from the time dependency of the apparent diffusion coefficient measured by QLS. The theory accurately represents the experimental observations for Abeta concentrations both below and above c*, the critical concentration for Abeta micelle formation. We suggest that the method of QLS in combination with this theory can serve as a powerful tool for understanding the molecular factors that control Abeta plaque formation.

9268388|a|Fibrillogenesis of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a seminal pathogenetic event in Alzheimer's disease. Inhibiting fibrillogenesis is thus one approach toward disease therapy. Rational design of fibrillogenesis inhibitors requires elucidation of the stages and kinetics of Abeta fibrillogenesis. We report results of studies designed to examine the initial stages of Abeta oligomerization. Size exclusion chromatography, quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy, and electron microscopy were used to characterize fibrillogenesis intermediates. After dissolution in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and removal of pre-existent seeds, Abeta chromatographed almost exclusively as a single peak. The molecules composing the peak had average hydrodynamic radii of 1.8 +/- 0.2 nm, consistent with the predicted size of dimeric Abeta. Over time, an additional peak, with a molecular weight >100,000, appeared. This peak contained predominantly curved fibrils, 6-8 nm in diameter and <200 nm in length, which we have termed "protofibrils." The kinetics of protofibril formation and disappearance are consistent with protofibrils being intermediates in the evolution of amyloid fibers. Protofibrils appeared during the polymerization of Abeta-(1-40), Abeta-(1-42), and Abeta-(1-40)-Gln22, peptides associated with both sporadic and inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that protofibril formation may be a general phenomenon in Abeta fibrillogenesis. If so, protofibrils could be attractive targets for fibrillogenesis inhibitors.

15292279|a|Islet amyloid deposition is a pathogenic feature of type 2 diabetes, and these deposits contain the unique amyloidogenic peptide islet amyloid polypeptide. Autopsy studies in humans have demonstrated that islet amyloid is associated with loss of beta-cell mass, but a direct role for amyloid in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes cannot be inferred from such studies. Animal studies in both spontaneous and transgenic models of islet amyloid formation have shown that amyloid forms in islets before fasting hyperglycemia and therefore does not arise merely as a result of the diabetic state. Furthermore, the extent of amyloid deposition is associated with both loss of beta-cell mass and impairment in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism, suggesting a causative role for islet amyloid in the islet lesion of type 2 diabetes. These animal studies have also shown that beta-cell dysfunction seems to be an important prerequisite for islet amyloid formation, with increased secretory demand from obesity and/or insulin resistance acting to further increase islet amyloid deposition. Recent in vitro studies suggest that the cytotoxic species responsible for islet amyloid-induced beta-cell death are formed during the very early stages of islet amyloid formation, when islet amyloid polypeptide aggregation commences. Interventions to prevent islet amyloid formation are emerging, with peptide and small molecule inhibitors being developed. These agents could thus lead to a preservation of beta-cell mass and amelioration of the islet lesion in type 2 diabetes.

18039111|a|Abstract Neurodegenerative diseases as diverse as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease share a common pathogenetic mechanism involving aggregation and deposition of misfolded proteins, which leads to progressive central nervous system disease. Although the type of aggregated protein and the regional and cellular distribution of deposition vary from disease to disease, these disorders may all be linked by similar pathways of protein aggregation with fibril formation and amyloid deposition. This perspective on pathogenesis suggests that a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases can be grouped mechanistically as brain amyloidoses, an outlook that yields novel insights into potential therapeutic approaches that may be applicable across the broad spectrum of neurodegenerative disease.

2062844|a|We have determined the coexistence curves (plots of phase-separation temperature T versus protein concentration C) for aqueous solutions of purified calf lens proteins. The proteins studied, calf gamma IIIa-, gamma IIIb-, and gamma IVa-crystallin, have very similar amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures. Both ascending and descending limbs of the coexistence curves were measured. We find that the coexistence curves for each of these proteins and for gamma II-crystallin can be fit, near the critical point, to the function /(Cc-C)/Cc/ = A [(Tc - T)/Tc]beta, where beta = 0.325, Cc is the critical protein concentration in mg/ml, Tc is the critical temperature for phase separation in K, and A is a parameter that characterizes the width of the coexistence curve. We find that A and Cc are approximately the same for all four coexistence curves (A = 2.6 +/- 0.1, Cc = 289 +/- 20 mg/ml), but that Tc is not the same. For gamma II- and gamma IIIb-crystallin, Tc approximately 5 degrees C, whereas for gamma IIIa- and gamma IVa-crystallin, Tc approximately 38 degrees C. By comparing the published protein sequences for calf, rat, and human gamma-crystallins, we postulate that a few key amino acid residues account for the division of gamma-crystallins into low-Tc and high-Tc groups.

1741375|a|We report measurement of the solid-liquid phase boundary, or liquidus line, for aqueous solutions of three pure calf gamma-crystallin proteins: gamma II, gamma IIIa, and gamma IIIb. We also studied the liquidus line for solutions of native gamma IV-crystallin calf lens protein, which consists of 85% gamma IVa/15% gamma IVb. In all four proteins the liquidus phase boundaries lie higher in temperature than the previously determined liquid-liquid coexistence curves. Thus, over the range of concentration and temperature for which liquid-liquid phase separation occurs, the coexistence of a protein crystal phase with a protein liquid solution phase is thermodynamically stable relative to the metastable separated liquid phases. The location of the liquidus lines clearly divides these four crystallin proteins into two groups: those in which liquidus lines flatten at temperatures greater than 70 degrees C: gamma IIIa and gamma IV, and those in which liquidus lines flatten at temperatures less than 50 degrees C: gamma II and gamma IIIb. We have analyzed the form of the liquidus lines by using specific choices for the structures of the Gibbs free energy in solution and solid phases. By applying the thermodynamic conditions for equilibrium between the two phases to the resulting chemical potentials, we can estimate the temperature-dependent free energy change upon binding of protein and water into the solid phase.

23345875|a|The concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient of particles suspended in solution depends primarily on the occupied volume fraction and on repulsive and attractive forces. This dependency is expressed by the interaction parameter, which can be assessed experimentally by light scattering measurements and have been determined for the diffusion coefficient of BSA under different salt concentration conditions in the present work. The result shows that the diffusion coefficient of protein grows up with increasing protein concentration, and when the ionic strength turns up gradually the diffusion coefficient decreases with protein concentration's increasing. The concentration dependence of BSA diffusion coefficients is interpreted in the context of a two-body potential of mean force, which includes repulsive hard-sphere and Coulombic interactions and attractive dispersion. With the increase of ionic strength, Debye screening decreases, protein interaction changes from repulsion to attraction, and protein begins to aggregate. By means of the concentration dependence of BSA diffusion coefficients, one can obtain the parameters of protein interactions and can find that protein bears a net effective charge of -9.0 e and has a Hamaker constant of 2.8k(B)T. This work demonstrates that DLS is an effective technique of studying protein interactions.

10449715|a|Protein crystallization, aggregation, liquid-liquid phase separation, and self-assembly are important in protein structure determination in the industrial processing of proteins and in the inhibition of protein condensation diseases. To fully describe such phase transformations in globular protein solutions, it is necessary to account for the strong spatial variation of the interactions on the protein surface. One difficulty is that each globular protein has its own unique surface, which is crucial for its biological function. However, the similarities amongst the macroscopic properties of different protein solutions suggest that there may exist a generic model that is capable of describing the nonuniform interactions between globular proteins. In this paper we present such a model, which includes the short-range interactions that vary from place to place on the surface of the protein. We show that this aeolotopic model [from the Greek aiolos ("variable") and topos ("place")] describes the phase diagram of globular proteins and provides insight into protein aggregation and crystallization.

12925745|a|It is generally assumed that crystallization begins with a small, crystalline nucleus. For proteins this paradigm may not be valid. Our numerical simulations show that under conditions typically used to produce protein crystals, small clusters of model proteins (particles with short-range, attractive interactions) cannot maintain a crystalline structure. Protein crystal nucleation is therefore an indirect, two-step process. A nucleus first forms and grows as a disordered, liquid-like aggregate. Once the aggregate grows beyond a critical size (about a few hundred particles) crystal nucleation becomes possible.

12729747|a|Several human cataracts have been linked to mutations in the gamma crystallin gene. One of these is the aculeiform cataract, which is caused by an R58H mutation in gammaD crystallin. We have shown previously that this cataract is caused by crystallization of the mutant protein, which is an order of magnitude less soluble than the wild-type. Here, we report the very high-resolution crystal structures of the mutant and wild-type proteins. Both proteins crystallize in the same space group and lattice. Thus, a strict comparison of the protein-protein and protein-water intermolecular interactions in the two crystal lattices is possible. Overall, the differences between the mutant and wild-type structures are small. At position 58, the mutant protein loses the direct ion-pair intermolecular interaction present in the wild-type, due to the differences between histidine and arginine at the atomic level; the interaction in the mutant is mediated by water molecules. Away from the mutation site, the mutant and wild-type lattice structures differ in the identity of side-chains that occupy alternate conformations. Since the interactions in the crystal phase are very similar for the two proteins, we conclude that the reduction in the solubility of the mutant is mainly due to the effect of the R58H mutation in the solution phase. The results presented here are also important as they are the first high-resolution X-ray structures of human gamma crystallins.

8943244|a|One of the major protein components of the ocular lens, alpha-crystallin, is composed of alphaA and alphaB chain subunits that have structural homology to the family of mammalian small heat shock proteins. Like other small heat shock proteins, alpha-crystallin subunits associate to form large oligomeric aggregates that express chaperone-like activity, as defined by the ability to suppress nonspecific aggregation of proteins destabilized by treatment with a variety of denaturants including heat, UV irradiation, and chemical modification. It has been proposed that age-related loss of sequences at the C terminus of the alphaA chain subunit may be a factor in the pathogenesis of cataract due to diminished capacity of the truncated crystallin to protect against nonspecific aggregation of lens proteins. To evaluate the functional consequences of alpha-crystallin modification, two mutant forms of alphaA subunits were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. Like wild type (WT), aggregates of approximately 540 kDa were formed from a tryptophan-free alphaA mutant (W9F). When added in stoichiometric amounts, both WT and W9F subunits completely suppressed the heat-induced aggregation of aldose reductase. In contrast, subunits encoded by a truncation mutant in which the C-terminal 17 residues were deleted (R157STOP), despite having spectroscopic properties similar to WT, formed much larger aggregates with a marked reduction in chaperone-like activity. Similar results were observed when the chaperone-like activity was assessed through inhibition of gamma-crystallin aggregation induced by singlet oxygen. These results demonstrate that the structurally conservative substitution of Phe for Trp-9 has a negligible effect on the functional interaction of alphaA subunits, and that deletion of C-terminal sequences from the alphaA subunit results in substantial loss of chaperone-like activity, despite overall preservation of secondary structure.

7862635|a|Aqueous solutions of the bovine eye lens protein gamma II (or gamma B)-crystallin at neutral pH show a gradual increase in phase separation temperature, Tph, when allowed to stand for several weeks at room temperature without reducing agents. In a typical experiment, the Tph of the protein solution (218 mg/ml) increases from 2.5 +/- 1 degree C to 32.5 +/- 1 degree C after 21 days, and a new protein species, gamma IIH, is formed. The Tph of pure gamma IIH is at least 40 degrees C higher than that of pure gamma II. The average apparent hydrodynamic radius is 36 A for gamma IIH compared to 26 A for gamma II. The molecular mass of gamma IIH is approximately 41.5 kDa compared to 20 kDa for native gamma II. Therefore, gamma IIH is probably a dimer of gamma II crystallin. gamma IIH has a lower thiol content than gamma II and is not formed in the presence of dithiothreitol. We conclude that gamma IIH is a thiol oxidation product of gamma II-crystallin and is a dimer containing an intermolecular disulfide crosslink. Thus, some oxidative modifications of protein thiol groups lead to an increase in net attractive interactions between proteins. As a result, Tph increases and protein aggregates are formed. These two microscopic changes produce the increased light scattering associated with lens opacification.

9489261|a|The experimental literature on individual and group psychological treatments for adult disorders is reviewed. For each of the 11 disorders or problems covered, treatments that fall into the following categories, as defined by D.L. Chambless and S. D. Hollon (1998), are identified: efficacious and specific, efficacious, and possibly efficacious. Behavioral and cognitive-behavioral treatments dominate the lists, especially in the anxiety disorders, with notable exceptions. Reasons for the hegemony of the behavioral and cognitive modalities are discussed, and some limitations of the empirically supported treatment concept are addressed. Continued research is recommended on Aptitude x Treatment interactions, cost-benefit ratios, and generalization of treatments to a variety of patient populations, therapists, and treatment settings.

10450627|a|Although relapse prevention (RP) has become a widely adopted cognitive-behavioral treatment intervention for alcohol, smoking, and other substance use, outcome studies have yielded an inconsistent picture of the efficacy of this approach or conditions for maximal effectiveness. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the overall effectiveness of RP and the extent to which certain variables may relate to treatment outcome. Twenty-six published and unpublished studies with 70 hypothesis tests representing a sample of 9,504 participants were included in the analysis. Results indicated that RP was generally effective, particularly for alcohol problems. Additionally, outcome was moderated by several variables. Specifically, RP was most effective when applied to alcohol or polysubstance use disorders, combined with the adjunctive use of medication, and when evaluated immediately following treatment using uncontrolled pre-post tests.

16055766|a|The past three decades have been marked by tremendous progress in behavioral therapies for drug abuse and dependence, as well as advances in the conceptualization of approaches to development of behavioral therapies. Cognitive behavior therapy, contingency management, couples and family therapy, and a variety of other types of behavioral treatment have been shown to be potent interventions for several forms of drug addiction, and scientific progress has also been greatly facilitated by the articulation of a systematic approach to the development, evaluation, and dissemination of behavioral therapies. The authors review recent progress in strategies for the development of behavioral therapies for drug and alcohol abuse and dependence and discuss the range of effective behavioral therapies that are currently available.

7979888|a|Neither the durability of brief ambulatory treatments for cocaine dependence nor the relative ability of psychotherapy vs pharmacotherapy to effect lasting change has been evaluated in well-controlled randomized trials.We conducted a 1-year naturalistic follow-up of 121 ambulatory cocaine abusers who underwent psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention or clinical management) and pharmacotherapy (desipramine hydrochloride or placebo) in a 2 x 2 design. Subjects were interviewed 1, 3, 6, or 12 months after the termination of a 12-week course of outpatient treatment. Eighty percent (n = 97) of the subjects who were randomized to treatment were followed up at least once.First, the effects of study treatments appeared durable over the follow-up; as for the full sample, measures of cocaine use indicated either improvement or no change over posttreatment levels. Second, abstinence during treatment was strongly associated with less cocaine use during follow-up. Third, random effects regression models indicated significant psychotherapy-by-time effects, suggesting a delayed improved response during follow-up for patients who received cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention compared with supportive clinical management.Our findings suggest a delayed emergence of the effects of cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention, which may reflect the subjects' implementation of the generalizable coping skills conveyed through that treatment. Moreover, these data underline the importance of conducting follow-up studies of substance abusers and other groups because delayed effects may occur after the cessation of short-term treatments.

16670409|a|Alcohol dependence treatment may include medications, behavioral therapies, or both. It is unknown how combining these treatments may impact their effectiveness, especially in the context of primary care and other nonspecialty settings.To evaluate the efficacy of medication, behavioral therapies, and their combinations for treatment of alcohol dependence and to evaluate placebo effect on overall outcome.Randomized controlled trial conducted January 2001-January 2004 among 1383 recently alcohol-abstinent volunteers (median age, 44 years) from 11 US academic sites with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnoses of primary alcohol dependence.Eight groups of patients received medical management with 16 weeks of naltrexone (100 mg/d) or acamprosate (3 g/d), both, and/or both placebos, with or without a combined behavioral intervention (CBI). A ninth group received CBI only (no pills). Patients were also evaluated for up to 1 year after treatment.Percent days abstinent from alcohol and time to first heavy drinking day.All groups showed substantial reduction in drinking. During treatment, patients receiving naltrexone plus medical management (n = 302), CBI plus medical management and placebos (n = 305), or both naltrexone and CBI plus medical management (n = 309) had higher percent days abstinent (80.6, 79.2, and 77.1, respectively) than the 75.1 in those receiving placebos and medical management only (n = 305), a significant naltrexone x behavioral intervention interaction (P = .009). Naltrexone also reduced risk of a heavy drinking day (hazard ratio, 0.72; 97.5% CI, 0.53-0.98; P = .02) over time, most evident in those receiving medical management but not CBI. Acamprosate showed no significant effect on drinking vs placebo, either by itself or with any combination of naltrexone, CBI, or both. During treatment, those receiving CBI without pills or medical management (n = 157) had lower percent days abstinent (66.6) than those receiving placebo plus medical management alone (n = 153) or placebo plus medical management and CBI (n = 156) (73.8 and 79.8, respectively; P<.001). One year after treatment, these between-group effects were similar but no longer significant.Patients receiving medical management with naltrexone, CBI, or both fared better on drinking outcomes, whereas acamprosate showed no evidence of efficacy, with or without CBI. No combination produced better efficacy than naltrexone or CBI alone in the presence of medical management. Placebo pills and meeting with a health care professional had a positive effect above that of CBI during treatment. Naltrexone with medical management could be delivered in health care settings, thus serving alcohol-dependent patients who might otherwise not receive treatment.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00006206.

16894069|a|Approximately 3% of the US population receives psychotherapy each year from psychiatrists, psychologists, or social workers. A modest number of psychotherapies are evidence-based therapy (EBT) in that they have been defined in manuals and found efficacious in at least 2 controlled clinical trials with random assignment that include a control condition of psychotherapy, placebo, pill, or other treatment and samples of sufficient power with well-characterized patients. Few practitioners use EBT.To determine the amount of EBT taught in accredited training programs in psychiatry, psychology (PhD and PsyD), and social work and to note whether the training was elective or required and presented as a didactic (coursework) or clinical supervision.A cross-sectional survey of a probability sample of all accredited training programs in psychiatry, psychology, and social work in the United States. Responders included training directors (or their designates) from 221 programs (73 in psychiatry, 63 in PhD clinical psychology, 21 in PsyD psychology, and 64 in master's-level social work). The overall response rate was 73.7%. Main Outcome Measure Requiring both a didactic and clinical supervision in an EBT.Although programs offered electives in EBT and non-EBT, few required both a didactic and clinical supervision in EBT, and most required training was non-EBT. Psychiatry required coursework and clinical supervision in the largest percentage of EBT (28.1%). Cognitive behavioral therapy was the EBT most frequently offered and required as a didactic in all 3 disciplines. More than 90% of the psychiatry training programs were complying with the new cognitive behavior therapy requirement. The 2 disciplines with the largest number of students and emphasis on clinical training-professional clinical psychology (PsyD) and social work-had the largest percentage of programs (67.3% and 61.7%, respectively) not requiring a didactic and clinical supervision in any EBT.There is a considerable gap between research evidence for psychotherapy and clinical training. Until the training programs in the major disciplines providing psychotherapy increase training in EBT, the gap between research evidence and clinical practice will remain.

11015800|a|The effects of drug dependence on social systems has helped shape the generally held view that drug dependence is primarily a social problem, not a health problem. In turn, medical approaches to prevention and treatment are lacking. We examined evidence that drug (including alcohol) dependence is a chronic medical illness. A literature review compared the diagnoses, heritability, etiology (genetic and environmental factors), pathophysiology, and response to treatments (adherence and relapse) of drug dependence vs type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. Genetic heritability, personal choice, and environmental factors are comparably involved in the etiology and course of all of these disorders. Drug dependence produces significant and lasting changes in brain chemistry and function. Effective medications are available for treating nicotine, alcohol, and opiate dependence but not stimulant or marijuana dependence. Medication adherence and relapse rates are similar across these illnesses. Drug dependence generally has been treated as if it were an acute illness. Review results suggest that long-term care strategies of medication management and continued monitoring produce lasting benefits. Drug dependence should be insured, treated, and evaluated like other chronic illnesses. JAMA. 2000;284:1689-1695.

15556121|a|There is national concern regarding the problems of alcohol and drug abuse and the adequacy and quality of the national addiction treatment system, particularly for adolescents. This article reviews the published literature evaluating the ability of health, education, and specialty treatment systems to identify and treat affected adolescents and adults. A separate section reviews the status of the national treatment system for adults through findings from a nationally representative survey of 175 specialty treatment programs. The findings are unambiguous and disturbing. Although substance abuse is prevalent in most schools, primary care practices, mental health clinics, and criminal justice agencies, there is insufficient training, organization, or reimbursement to screen, assess, and refer those with dependence or abuse disorders to appropriate services. There are too few programs available to treat those substance-dependent patients who are screened and significant barriers for patients attempting to enter those programs. Finally, the organizational, administrative, and personnel infrastructures of many treatment programs are fragile and unstable, making them unable to implement evidence-based care. These problems are serious in the adult system and even worse in the adolescent system. The article concludes with suggestions for improving systems integration to improve the quantity and quality of available care.

Seventy-eight community-based clinicians were assigned to 1 of 3 training conditions: review of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) manual only, review of the manual plus access to a CBT training Web site, or review of the manual plus a didactic seminar followed by supervised casework. The primary outcome measure was the clinicians' ability to demonstrate key CBT interventions, as assessed by independent ratings of structured role plays. Statistically significant differences favoring the seminar plus supervision over the manual only condition were found for adherence and skill ratings for 2 of the 3 role plays, with intermediate scores for the Web condition.

This study examined the feasibility of training substance abuse counselors to deliver cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) using treatment manuals. Participants were 29 counselors. Counselors were randomly assigned to receive CBT training or to a control group. Counselor attitudes were assessed pre- and posttraining. In addition, CBT therapy sessions were videotaped and rated for adherence and skillfulness. CBT counselors reported high levels of satisfaction with the training, intention to use CBT interventions, and confidence in their ability to do so. Ratings indicated that 90% of counselors were judged as having attained at least adequate levels of CBT skillfulness. Findings demonstrate the feasibility of using psychotherapy technology tools as a means of disseminating science-based treatments to the substance abuse practice community.

16171953|a|Previously, we found that impaired cognition predicted treatment dropout from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in a small sample of cocaine dependent patients. To further address the role of impaired cognition in retention and treatment outcome of cocaine-dependent patients in CBT, we expanded a previous investigation to a larger sample, added depressed cocaine patients, and added an additional cognitive assessment. Fifty-six cocaine dependent patients receiving CBT in outpatient clinical trials were assessed for cognitive performance at treatment entry with the computerized MicroCog (MC) and the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST). Treatment completion was defined as 12 or more weeks. Treatment dropouts had significantly lower MC scores (poorer cognitive functioning) than completers on attention, memory, spatial ability, speed, accuracy, global functioning, and cognitive proficiency, with effect sizes in the moderate to large range. These findings were not affected by depression, demographics (age, gender, race, sex, marital status) or drug use (years of cocaine use or average weekly cocaine expenditure in the prior 30 days). In contrast, patients' performance on the WCST was in the average or near-average range, and WCST scores did not differentiate between completers and dropouts. Consistent with previous research, results suggest that mild cognitive impairments (< or =1 S.D. below the mean) negatively affect retention in outpatient CBT treatment for cocaine dependence. Future studies should examine whether there are specific effects of different executive functioning abilities on treatment outcome. Modified behavioral and pharmacologic interventions should be considered to target mild cognitive impairments to improve substance treatment outcome.

17112400|a|We studied to what extent internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) programs for symptoms of depression and anxiety are effective.A meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials.The effects of internet-based CBT were compared to control conditions in 13 contrast groups with a total number of 2334 participants. A meta-analysis on treatment contrasts resulted in a moderate to large mean effect size [fixed effects analysis (FEA) d=0.40, mixed effects analysis (MEA) d=0.60] and significant heterogeneity. Therefore, two sets of post hoc subgroup analyses were carried out. Analyses on the type of symptoms revealed that interventions for symptoms of depression had a small mean effect size (FEA d=0.27, MEA d=0.32) and significant heterogeneity. Further analyses showed that one study could be regarded as an outlier. Analyses without this study showed a small mean effect size and moderate, non-significant heterogeneity. Interventions for anxiety had a large mean effect size (FEA and MEA d=0.96) and very low heterogeneity. When examining the second set of subgroups, based on therapist assistance, no significant heterogeneity was found. Interventions with therapist support (n=5) had a large mean effect size, while interventions without therapist support (n=6) had a small mean effect size (FEA d=0.24, MEA d=0.26).In general, effect sizes of internet-based interventions for symptoms of anxiety were larger than effect sizes for depressive symptoms; however, this might be explained by differences in the amount of therapist support.

14622082|a|Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the psychological treatment of choice for panic disorder (PD). However, given limited access to CBT, it must be delivered with maximal cost-effectiveness. Previous researchers have found that a brief computer-augmented CBT was as effective as extended therapist-delivered CBT. To test this finding, this study randomly allocated 186 patients with PD across 2 sites in Scotland and Australia to 12 sessions of therapist-delivered CBT (CBT12), 6 sessions of therapist-delivered (CBT6) or computer-augmented CBT (CBT6-CA), or a waitlist control. On a composite measure, at posttreatment, the outcome for CBT 12 was statistically better than the outcome for CBT6. The outcome for CBT6-CA fell between CBT12 and CBT6, but could not be statistically distinguished from either treatment. The active treatments did not differ statistically at 6-month follow-up. The study provided some support for the use of computers as an innovative adjunctive-therapy tool and merits further investigation.

Palmtop computers, with a program developed to incorporate basic principles of CBT, were used by CBT4-CA clients whenever they felt anxious or wanted to practice the therapy techniques and were used by all participants as a momentary assessment tool. CBT4-CA clients carried the computer at all times and continued to use it for 8 weeks after termination of therapy. Analyses of clinically significant changes showed superiority of CBT12 at posttest on some measures; however, there were no differences at follow-up.

12622301|a|Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) brings about significant clinical improvement in anxiety and depression, but therapists are in short supply. We report the first phase of a randomized controlled trial of an interactive multimedia program of cognitive-behavioural techniques, Beating the Blues (BtB), in the treatment of patients in general practice with anxiety, depression or mixed anxiety/depression.One hundred and sixty-seven adults suffering from anxiety and/or depression and not receiving any form of psychological treatment or counselling were randomly allocated to receive, with or without medication, BtB or treatment as usual (TAU). Measures were taken on five occasions: prior to treatment, 2 months later, and at 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up using the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Work and Social Adjustment Scale.Patients who received BtB showed significantly greater improvement in depression and anxiety compared to TAU by the end of treatment (2 months) and to 6 months follow-up. Symptom reduction was paralleled by improvement in work and social adjustment. There were no interactions of BtB with concomitant pharmacotherapy or duration of illness, but evidence, on the Beck Anxiety Inventory only, of interaction with primary care practice. Importantly, there was no interaction between the effects of BtB and baseline severity of depression, from which we conclude that the effects of the computer program are independent of starting level of depression.These results demonstrate that computerized interactive multimedia cognitive-behavioural techniques under minimal clinical supervision can bring about improvements in depression and anxiety, as well as in work and social adjustment, with and without pharmacotherapy and in patients with pre-treatment illness of durations greater or less than 6 months. Thus, our results indicate that wider dissemination of cognitive-behavioural techniques is possible for patients suffering from anxiety and/or depression.

Both CBT treatments were more effective in reducing PD symptomatology, panic-related cognition, negative affect, and number of GP visits and improving physical health ratings. Internet treatment was more effective than CBT manual in reducing clinician-rated agoraphobia and number of GP visits at post-assessment. At follow-up, these effects were maintained for both CBT groups, with internet CBT better at improving physical health ratings and reducing GP visits.

17570957|a|Computer-guided therapy is an innovative treatment strategy that could have an important role in the future of psychological treatment. This paper summarises the available published evidence that assesses the effectiveness of a computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (CCBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).Fifteen electronic bibliographic databases including Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Cinahl, PsycINFO, Biological Abstracts, HMIC and NHS CRD databases were comprehensively searched in March 2004: ['obsessive compulsive disorder' (text and indexed terms)] AND ['cognitive therapy' (text and indexed terms)] AND ['computer' (text and indexed terms)]. Reference lists of included studies, guidelines, generic research, trials registers and specialist mental health sites were hand-searched.The search produced 149 citations from which we identified two RCTs and two single-arm studies with relevant data. All four studies used one software programme - BTSteps. In the large RCT, YBOCS effect sizes for BTSteps, therapist-led cognitive behaviour therapy (TCBT) and relaxation (RLX) were 0.84, 1.22, and 0.35, respectively. The smaller RCT found significantly better outcomes with brief scheduled support compared to brief on-demand phone support.BTSteps was as good as TCBT for reducing time spent in rituals and obsessions and for improving the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSA), and was superior to RLX treatment. The available evidence also showed that improvement of OCD persisted beyond the end of CCBT. TCBT was more effective than CCBT for all patients overall though not in those who went on to start self-exposure. Such a system has the potential to widen the access to CBT in general and considerably shorten clinician-guided care.

15930065|a|The aim of this investigation was to compare the efficacy of computer-assisted cognitive therapy against standard cognitive therapy and a control group without treatment for outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder.Medication-free participants (N=45) with major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to cognitive therapy (N=15), computer-assisted cognitive therapy (N=15), or a wait list (N=15). Both active treatments consisted of nine sessions over 8 weeks. Therapist time was reduced after the first visit for computer-assisted cognitive therapy, with 25-minute sessions rather than 50-minute sessions. Assessments were completed pretreatment, after 4 and 8 weeks of therapy, and 3 and 6 months posttreatment.Computer-assisted cognitive therapy and standard cognitive therapy were superior to the wait list control group for treatment of depression and did not differ from each other on the primary outcome variables. Very large between-group effect sizes were observed. Improvement in depression for both computer-assisted cognitive therapy and standard cognitive therapy was maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations. Computer-assisted cognitive therapy had more robust effects, relative to being wait-listed, than standard cognitive therapy in reducing measures of cognitive distortion and in improving knowledge about cognitive therapy.A multimedia, computer-assisted form of cognitive therapy with reduced therapist contact was as efficacious as standard cognitive therapy. Computer-assisted therapy could decrease costs and improve access to cognitive therapy for depression.

15231556|a|Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective for treating anxiety and depression in primary care, but there is a shortage of therapists. Computer-delivered treatment may be a viable alternative.To assess the cost-effectiveness of computer-delivered CBT.A sample of people with depression or anxiety were randomised to usual care (n=128) or computer-delivered CBT (n=146). Costs were available for 123 and 138 participants, respectively. Costs and depression scores were combined using the net benefit approach.Service costs were 40 British pounds (90% CI - 28 British pounds to 148 British pounds) higher over 8 months for computer-delivered CBT. Lost-employment costs were 407 British pounds (90% CI 196 British pounds to 586 British pounds) less for this group. Valuing a 1-unit improvement on the Beck Depression Inventory at 40 British pounds, there is an 81% chance that computer-delivered CBT is cost-effective, and it revealed a highly competitive cost per quality-adjusted life year.Computer-delivered CBT has a high probability of being cost-effective, even if a modest value is placed on unit improvements in depression.

15847626|a|To assess the efficacy of World Wide Web-based tailored behavioral smoking cessation materials among nicotine patch users.Two-group randomized controlled trial.World Wide Web in England and Republic of Ireland.A total of 3971 subjects who purchased a particular brand of nicotine patch and logged-on to use a free web-based behavioral support program.Web-based tailored behavioral smoking cessation materials or web-based non-tailored materials.Twenty-eight-day continuous abstinence rates were assessed by internet-based survey at 6-week follow-up and 10-week continuous rates at 12-week follow-up.Using three approaches to the analyses of 6- and 12-week outcomes, participants in the tailored condition reported clinically and statistically significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than participants in the non-tailored condition. In our primary analyses using as a denominator all subjects who logged-on to the treatment site at least once, continuous abstinence rates at 6 weeks were 29.0% in the tailored condition versus 23.9% in the non-tailored condition (OR = 1.30; P = 0.0006); at 12 weeks continuous abstinence rates were 22.8% versus 18.1%, respectively (OR = 1.34; P = 0.0006). Moreover, satisfaction with the program was significantly higher in the tailored than in the non-tailored condition.The results of this study demonstrate a benefit of the web-based tailored behavioral support materials used in conjunction with nicotine replacement therapy. A web-based program that collects relevant information from users and tailors the intervention to their specific needs had significant advantages over a web-based non-tailored cessation program.

17491172|a|Internet interventions for smoking cessation are ubiquitous. Yet, to date, there are few randomized clinical trials that gauge their efficacy. This study is a randomized clinical trial (N= 284, n= 140 in the treatment group, n= 144 in the control group) of an Internet smoking cessation intervention. Smokers were randomly assigned to receive either bupropion plus counseling alone, or bupropion and counseling in addition to 12 weeks of access to the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Smoking Cessation and Relapse Prevention (CHESS SCRP; a Web site which provided information on smoking cessation as well as support). We found that access to CHESS SCRP was not significantly related to abstinence at the end of the treatment period (OR= 1.13, 95% CI 0.66-2.62) or at 6 months postquit (OR= 1.48, 95% CI 0.66-2.62). However, the number of times participants used CHESS SCRP per week was related to abstinence at both end of treatment (OR= 1.79, 95% CI 1.25-2.56) and at the 6-month follow-up (OR= 1.59, 95% CI 1.06-2.38). Participants with access to CHESS SCRP logged in an average of 33.64 times (SD=30.76) over the 90-day period of access. Rates of CHESS SCRP use did not differ by ethnicity, level of education or gender (all p>.05). In sum, results suggest that participants used CHESS SCRP frequently, CHESS SCRP use was related to success, but the effects in general did not yield intergroup effects.

17471790|a|Nicotine replacement products are commonly used to promote smoking cessation, but alternative and complementary methods may increase cessation rates. The current experiment compared the short-term effects of a transdermal nicotine patch to voucher-based reinforcement of smoking abstinence on cigarette smoking. Fourteen heavy smokers (7 men and 7 women) completed the four 5-day phases of the study: baseline, patch treatment, voucher treatment, and return to baseline. The order of the two treatment phases was counterbalanced across participants. In the patch treatment condition, participants wore a 14-mg transdermal nicotine patch every day. In the voucher treatment condition, participants received vouchers contingent on abstinence from smoking, defined as producing carbon monoxide (CO) readings of < or =4 parts per million. Participants e-mailed two video clips per day showing them breathing into a CO monitor and the resulting CO reading to clinic staff. In the voucher treatment, 24% of samples were negative, and 5% of samples were negative in the patch treatment. Results suggest that contingent vouchers were more effective than transdermal nicotine patches in promoting abstinence.

Treatment consisted of a computer-based brief motivational intervention, the Drinker's Check-up (DCU). Outcomes strongly support the experimental hypotheses and long-term effectiveness of the treatment. Overall, participants reduced the quantity and frequency of drinking by 50%, and had similar reductions in alcohol-related problems that were sustained through 12-month follow-up. The DCU seems to be effective in enhancing problem drinkers' motivation for change.

Results at each of 3 follow-ups strongly support the study hypotheses. Participants in the immediate treatment group significantly reduced their drinking relative to their pretreatment levels and relative to those in the delayed treatment condition at the initial follow-up, 10 weeks after the pretreatment assessment. The delayed group did not change their drinking behaviors during this period of time. However, they significantly reduced their drinking by the second follow-up conducted after they received training. At the 12-month follow-up, participants maintained the gains they had achieved during treatment. There were no interactions involving participant ethnicity or gender. Although use of other drugs was not specifically addressed, such use did not increase, and there was some evidence of a decline.

17130139|a|To test the feasibility of online alcohol screening and brief intervention (BI) by comparing (i) two approaches to inviting all students to be screened, and (ii) a minimal versus a more extensive BI.Freshmen students at one university were randomized to receive one of two types of email invitations to an online anonymous: (i) general health assessment, or (ii) alcohol-specific assessment. All were linked to the same alcohol screening survey. Those with unhealthy alcohol use (AUDIT >or=8) were randomly assigned to minimal or more extensive online alcohol BI.In both invitation groups (4008 students), 55% of students completed the online screening. Overall, 37% of men and 26% of women had unhealthy alcohol use. Compared to minimal BI, more extensive BI was associated with intention to seek help among men and with a greater increase in readiness to change among women. One month after BI, 75% of students completed another assessment, 33% of women and 15% of men with unhealthy alcohol use at baseline no longer had unhealthy alcohol use. There were no significant differences on drinking measures by BI randomization group.Over half of an entire freshman class of college students were reached by email and completed alcohol screening and brief intervention. Even an alcohol-specific invitation did not deter students. Although brief interventions that differed had some gender specific effects on readiness to change and intention, in general, unhealthy alcohol use decreased after brief intervention. Web screening and brief intervention show promise for addressing unhealthy alcohol use by college students.

16173864|a|The relationship between treatment outcome and the extent to which participants completed homework assignments was evaluated among 60 cocaine-dependent individuals assigned to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Homework was assigned in 72% of all sessions and initiated by participants in 48% of the sessions in which it was assigned. Completion of homework was unrelated to participants' baseline characteristics and several indicators of treatment compliance. Participants who completed more homework assignments demonstrated significantly greater increases in the quantity and quality of their coping skills and used significantly less cocaine during treatment and through a 1-year follow-up. These data suggest that the extent to which participants are willing to complete extrasession assignments may be an important mediator of response to CBT.

Regression analyses revealed a significant relationship between homework compliance and cocaine use that was moderated by readiness to change. Homework compliance predicted less cocaine use during treatment but only for participants higher in readiness to change. For those lower in readiness to change, homework compliance was not associated with cocaine use during treatment. Homework compliance early in therapy was associated with better retention in treatment. Homework compliance was not predicted by participants' level of education or readiness to change. These findings support the use of homework during CBT for substance use disorders.

7723001|a|In comparative or matching research involving two or more treatments, the equivalence of the patient groups is of critical importance. In the past, equivalence has either been imposed by matching or balancing, or has been assured statistically by randomization. Matching and balancing, while useful in many contexts, nonetheless have important limitations, as does simple randomization. In recent years, a new tool has been developed that represents a compromise between balancing and randomization. This method, urn randomization, gives clinical investigators new options for improving the credibility of studies at a relatively modest cost. Urn randomization is randomization that is systematically based in favor of balancing. It can be used with several covariates, both marginally and jointly, producing optimal multivariate equivalence of treatment groups for large sample sizes. It preserves randomization as the primary basis for assignment to treatment and is less susceptible to experimenter bias or manipulation of the allocation process by staff than is balancing. Disadvantages include the fact that it is more difficult to implement, and that it violates the simple probability model of simple randomization. A number of research studies on addictions, including client-treatment matching trials, have used urn randomization. A summary of the mechanics of urn randomization is presented, and guidelines for its use in treatment studies are discussed.

There was a significant main effect of CM on treatment retention and marijuana-free urine specimens. Moreover, the combination of MET/CBT plus CM was significantly more effective than MET/CBT without CM or DC plus CM, which were in turn more effective than DC without CM for treatment attendance and percentage of marijuana-free urine specimens. Participants assigned to MET/CBT continued to reduce the frequency of their marijuana use through a 6-month follow-up.

Medication compliance was monitored using a riboflavin marker procedure. Both behavioral therapies (CBT and IPT) were manual guided and were delivered in individual sessions for 12 weeks.Random regression analyses of self-reported frequency of cocaine use and results of urine toxicology screens.Participants assigned to disulfiram reduced their cocaine use significantly more than those assigned to placebo, and those assigned to CBT reduced their cocaine use significantly more than those assigned to IPT (P<.01 for both). Findings were consistent across all study samples (eg, intention to treat, treatment initiators, and treatment completers). Benefits of disulfiram use and CBT were most pronounced for participants who were not alcohol dependent at baseline or who fully abstained from drinking alcohol during treatment. Adverse effects experienced by participants who received disulfiram were mild and were not considerably different from those experienced by participants who received placebo.Disulfiram and CBT are effective therapies for general populations of cocaine-dependent individuals. Disulfiram seems to exert a direct effect on cocaine use rather than through reducing concurrent alcohol use.

Sobell, 1996) interview, which uses a calendar method developed to evaluate daily patterns and frequency of drinking behavior over a specified time period, has well-established reliability and validity for assessing alcohol consumption. Although several investigators have used the TLFB to evaluate drug-using behavior, few studies have examined the psychometric properties of the interview for this purpose. The authors conducted TLFB interviews with a sample of adult drug-abusing patients seeking treatment for substance abuse (n = 113) at baseline, posttreatment, and quarterly thereafter for 12 months. It was found that the patients' reports about their drug consumption using this method generally had high (a) retest reliability, (b) convergent and discriminant validity with other measures, (c) agreement with collateral informants' reports of patients' substance use, and (d) agreement with results from patients' urine assays.

The TLFB showed fair to moderate validity, and the weekly calendar showed moderate to high validity in measuring the frequency of cocaine use. Similar results were obtained when the self-report measures were used to time specific cocaine use episodes. In addition to evidence for superiority of the weekly calendar, the validity of self-reports was inversely related to the percentage of positive urine test results. Furthermore, there was some evidence that validity increased as the time window over which the comparisons were drawn increased. Given the central role of self-reports in the clinical and research evaluation of drug use, factors affecting their validity warrant further investigation.

Retrospective reports covering 6 months were compared with urine samples taken weekly during the interval. Test-retest correlations were high and timeline estimates of drug use frequency were significantly correlated with the frequency of drug-positive urine results. Thus, timeline reports of drug-use frequency appeared both reliable and valid. Individual participants either over- or under-reported by an average of about 15%, and they did not identify instances of drug use with greater than chance accuracy when particular episodes of drug use occurred. These results support the use of timeline reports to make group comparisons of long-term drug use, but suggest that timeline data should not be used to identify specific drug-use episodes. Work with other drug-use population is necessary to extend these conclusions.

Greater substance use at follow-up was predicted only by greater severity of alcohol and drug use at treatment admission, not by the number of services received during treatment.

Primary outcome measures included cocaine use and arrests. Self-reported cocaine use showed high overall agreement with urine (79% agreement) and hair (80% agreement) toxicology analyses.Weekly cocaine use was reported by 25% of the sample at 5 years, slightly higher than the 21% at 1 year. Similarly, 26% had cocaine detected in urine specimens at follow-up and 18% reported having been arrested. Poorer long-term outcomes were related to higher problem severity at treatment admission and low treatment exposure.The large decreases in cocaine use 1 year after treatment discharge were sustained during the 5-year follow-up. Severity of drug and psychosocial problems at intake was predictive of long-term outcomes and outcomes improved in direct relation to level of treatment exposure.

1341656|a|Structural equation modelling (SEM) is a modern statistical method that allows one to evaluate causal hypotheses on a set of intercorrelated nonexperimental data. The sample variances and covariances, and possibly the means, are compared to those predicted by a theory-based hypothetical model after optimal estimation of the parameters of the model. The goodness-of-fit of the empirical data to the hypothesized model is evaluated statistically. This review describes the underlying statistical theory and rationale of SEM. Both confirmatory factor analysis and latent variable path models are discussed. The applicability of SEM to assessment of reliability and validity is noted. A detailed example is provided, and several examples from the medical literature are briefly reviewed. Cautions regarding the possible misuse or misinterpretation of the technique are also mentioned. Possible future directions for the use of SEM in medical research are suggested. Two appendices provide more technical details.

In an effort to facilitate greater emphasis on issues such as utility, practicality, and cost earlier in the evaluation of promising therapies, the authors propose a hybrid model to link efficacy and effectiveness research. A hybrid model may foster broader use of empirically validated treatments in substance abuse treatment programs and enhance the scientific yield of effectiveness research. The hybrid model retains essential features of efficacy research (randomization, use of control conditions, independent assessment of outcome, and monitoring of treatment delivery) while expanding the research questions to also address issues of importance in effectiveness studies. Such issues include diversity in settings, clinicians, and patients; cost-effectiveness of treatment; training issues; and patient and clinician satisfaction.

To highlight the complex issues that arise in conducting and interpreting data from intention-to-treat analyses in studies with substantial levels of protocol violation (e.g. attrition, noncompliance, or withdrawal of participants), data from a clinical trial of treatment for cocaine dependence were analyzed using three strategies to manage missing data: Strategy 1 addressed the effectiveness of treatments based on data collected from participants up to the point of dropout. Strategy 2 addressed the effectiveness of treatments based on data from the full intended duration of the protocol including data collected after participant dropout. The third strategy used a more novel approach, which used an intention-to-treat strategy for the full duration of the trial and the full sample, but also evaluated the effect of treatment retention outcomes by including an independent variable to reflect active treatment retention as a time-varying covariate. Conclusions about the relative efficacy of the study treatments varied to some extent depending on the analytic strategy used. These findings suggest that investigators should make every effort to conduct intent-to-treat analyses, but also to make use of multiple analytic strategies to fully understand the effects of the treatments studied. Moreover, regardless of the strategy used, investigators should clearly describe their handling of data from participants who violate the protocol.

14731824|a|Extracellular growth-stimulatory and -inhibitory signals govern the subunit assembly and activity of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), which in turn can phosphorylate the retinoblastoma gene product, pRb, to cancel its growth-suppressive function. Hypophosphorylated forms of pRb, present only during the G1 phase, sequester target proteins including known transcription factors, but pRb phosphorylation late in G1 prevents these interactions and thus frees factors to alter the expression of genes required for entry into S phase. Although pRb can act as a regulator of the G1-S transition, its loss is tolerated by most cells, suggesting that its functions overlap with those of other regulators or are restricted to special circumstances under which cells exit the division cycle.

8014186|a|A cell divides into two daughter cells by progressing serially through the precisely controlled G1, S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle. The crossing of the G1/S border, which is marked by the initiation of DNA synthesis, represents commitment to division into two complete cells. Beyond this critical point no further external signals are required. We now have more comprehensive knowledge of the temporal sequence of systems at this key transition from G1 to S--growth factor responses, a cascade of kinase reactions, activation of cyclins and their associated kinases, and oncogene and tumor suppressor gene products. Furthermore, we know that the absolute requirement for calcium and the timing of events associated with calmodulin and the 68 kDa calmodulin-binding protein are consistent with overall Ca++/calmodulin control of all steps from the response to growth factors in G1 to DNA replication in S phase. We now have to sort out the inter-relationships of myriad control proteins and their relation to the Ca++/calmodulin-dependent controls--Which are causes? Which are effects? And which are parallel processes? The answers will be important, as they represent both a much deeper understanding of this key process of life and an important opportunity for improving therapeutic medicine.

9338094|a|On the basis of current knowledge, control of the G1/S phase transition is largely a matter of regulating a set of specific cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) activities. In mammalian cells, the G1/S specific CDK activities are composed of complexes between D type cyclins and either CDK4 or CDK6 and between cyclin E (and possibly cyclin A) and CDK2. A variety of internal and external signals regulate G1/S specific CDKs by modulating cyclin availability, the levels of CDK inhibitory proteins and the phosphorylation status of CDKs. Although much is now known about the regulation of G1/S specific CDKs, the only well characterized substrate to date is the retinoblastoma gene product, RB. Phosphorylation of RB by CDKs neutralizes its cell cycle inhibitory properties, allowing progression of G1 to S phase. Not surprisingly, many components of the cell cycle regulatory machinery, including CDKs, CDK inhibitors and CDK substrates, are important targets of mutations that lead to human malignancy.

11257102|a|Over the past decade, studies focusing on the mechanisms controlling cellular proliferation have converged with equally intensive efforts directed at the analysis of oncogenic pathways associated with human cancer. These convergent studies have revealed the central role played by the pathway that controls the activity of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), which in turn regulates the E2F transcription factor. In particular, it is now clear that the Rb/E2F pathway is critical in regulating the initiation of DNA replication. It is also clear that the control of the pathway is disrupted in virtually all human cancers. Questions remain, however, as to the specific role played by individual activities within the pathway in the control of cell growth and their participation in the development of cancer.

2877398|a|The genomes of various tumour cells contain mutant oncogenes that act dominantly, in that their effects can be observed when they are introduced into non-malignant cells. There is evidence for another class of oncogenes, in which tumour-predisposing mutations are recessive to wild-type alleles. Retinoblastoma is a prototype biological model for the study of such recessive oncogenes. This malignant tumour, which arises in the eyes of children, can be explained as the result of two distinct genetic changes, each causing loss of function of one of the two homologous copies at a single genetic locus, Rb, assigned to the q14 band of human chromosome 13. Mutations affecting this locus may be inherited from a parent, may arise during gametogenesis or may occur somatically. Those who inherit a mutant allele at this locus have a high incidence of non-ocular, second tumours, almost half of which are osteosarcomas believed to be caused by the same mutation. Here we describe the isolation of a complementary DNA segment that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at this locus. The gene is expressed in many tumour types, but no RNA transcript has been found in retinoblastomas and osteosarcomas. The cDNA fragment detects a locus spanning at least 70 kilobases (kb) in human chromosome band 13q14, all or part of which is frequently deleted in retinoblastomas and osteosarcomas.

2838909|a|Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been associated with loss of heterozygosity at several distinct genetic loci including chromosomes 3p, 13q, and 17p. To determine whether the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) localized at 13q14, might be the target of recessive mutations in lung cancer, eight primary SCLC tumors and 50 cell lines representing all major histologic types of lung cancer were examined with the Rb complementary DNA probe. Structural abnormalities within the Rb gene were observed in 1/8 (13%) primary SCLC tumors, 4/22 (18%) SCLC lines, and 1/4 (25%) pulmonary carcinoid lines (comparable to the 20 to 40% observed in retinoblastoma), but were not detected in other major types of lung cancer. Rb messenger RNA expression was absent in 60% of the SCLC lines and 75% of pulmonary carcinoid lines, including all samples with DNA abnormalities. In contrast, Rb transcripts were found in 90% of non-SCLC lung cancer lines and in normal human lung. The finding of abnormalities of the Rb gene in SCLC and pulmonary carcinoids (both neuroendocrine tumors) suggests that this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of a common adult malignancy.

15838516|a|The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the pRB-related p107 and p130 comprise the 'pocket protein' family of cell cycle regulators. These proteins are best known for their roles in restraining the G1-S transition through the regulation of E2F-responsive genes. pRB and the p107/p130 pair are required for the repression of distinct sets of genes, potentially due to their selective interactions with E2Fs that are engaged at specific promoter elements. In addition to regulating E2F-responsive genes in a reversible manner, pocket proteins contribute to silencing of such genes in cells that are undergoing senescence or differentiation. Pocket proteins also affect the G1-S transition through E2F-independent mechanisms, such as by inhibiting Cdk2 or by stabilizing p27(Kip1), and they are implicated in the control of G0 exit, the spatial organization of replication, and genomic rereplication. New insights into pocket protein regulation have also been obtained. Kinases previously thought to be crucial to pocket protein phosphorylation have been shown to be redundant, and new modes of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have been identified. Despite these advances, much remains to be learned about the pocket proteins, particularly with regard to their developmental and tumor suppressor functions. Thus continues the story of the pocket proteins and the cell cycle.

15838517|a|The E2 factor (E2F) family of transcription factors are downstream targets of the retinoblastoma protein. E2F factors have been known for several years to be important regulators of S-phase entry. Recent studies have improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action used by this transcriptional network. In addition, they have given us an appreciation of the fact that E2F has functions that reach beyond G1/S control and impact cell proliferation in several different ways. The discovery of new family members with unusual properties, the unexpected phenotypes of mutant animals, a diverse collection of biological activities, a large number of new putative target genes and the new modes of transcriptional regulation have all contributed to an increasingly complex view of E2F function. In this review, we will discuss these recent developments and describe how they are beginning to shape a new and revised picture of the E2F transcriptional program.

10499802|a|We present evidence that phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of Rb by Cdk4/6 initiates successive intramolecular interactions between the C-terminal region and the central pocket. The initial interaction displaces histone deacetylase from the pocket, blocking active transcriptional repression by Rb. This facilitates a second interaction that leads to phosphorylation of the pocket by Cdk2 and disruption of pocket structure. These intramolecular interactions provide a molecular basis for sequential phosphorylation of Rb by Cdk4/6 and Cdk2. Cdk4/6 is activated early in G1, blocking active repression by Rb. However, it is not until near the end of G1, when cyclin E is expressed and Cdk2 is activated, that Rb is prevented from binding and inactivating E2F.

8626527|a|The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, RB, contains at least three distinct protein binding domains. The A/B pocket binds proteins with the LXCXE motif, the C pocket binds the nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase, and the large A/B pocket binds the transcription factor E2F. Dissociation of RB from its targets is observed as RB becomes phosphorylated during G1/S progression. There are 16 Cdk consensus phosphorylation sites in RB. It was previously unknown whether the many phosphorylation sites had redundant or distinct functions in the regulation of RB. Using RB mutant proteins lacking specific phosphorylation sites, we show that each of the binding domains is inhibited by different sites. Thr-821/826 phosphorylation is required to inhibit the binding to LXCXE containing proteins. Mutation of these two sites does not interfere with the hyperphosphorylation of RB. However, this phosphorylated mutant retains the ability to bind T-Ag, E7, and Elf-1, all of which contain the LXCXE motif. In contrast, Ser-807/811 phosphorylation is required to disrupt c-Abl binding. Mutation of Ser-807/811 and Thr-821/826 does not abolish the regulation of E2F binding. Taken together, these results show that the protein binding domains of RB are each regulated by distinct Cdk phosphorylation sites.

9315635|a|The growth suppression function of RB is dependent on its protein binding activity. RB contains at least three distinct protein binding functions: (i) the A/B pocket, which binds proteins with the LXCXE motif; (ii) the C pocket, which binds the c-Abl tyrosine kinase; and (iii) the large A/B pocket, which binds the E2F family of transcription factors. Phosphorylation of RB, which is catalyzed by cyclin-dependent protein kinases, inhibits all three protein binding activities. We have previously shown that LXCXE binding is inactivated by the phosphorylation of two threonines (Thr821 and Thr826), while the C pocket is inhibited by the phosphorylation of two serines (Ser807 and Ser811). In this report, we show that the E2F binding activity of RB is inhibited by two sets of phosphorylation sites acting through distinct mechanisms. Phosphorylation at several of the seven C-terminal sites can inhibit E2F binding. Additionally, phosphorylation of two serine sites in the insert domain can inhibit E2F binding, but this inhibition requires the presence of the RB N-terminal region. RB mutant proteins lacking all seven C-terminal sites and two insert domain serines can block Rat-1 cells in G1. These RB mutants can bind LXCXE proteins, c-Abl, and E2F even after they become phosphorylated at the remaining nonmutated sites. Thus, multiple phosphorylation sites regulate the protein binding activities of RB through different mechanisms, and a constitutive growth suppressor can be generated through the combined mutation of the relevant phosphorylation sites in RB.

9819434|a|Cells initiate proliferation in response to growth factor stimulation, but the biochemical mechanisms linking signals received at the cell surface receptors to the cell cycle regulatory molecules are not yet clear. In this study, we show that the signaling molecule Raf-1 can physically interact with Rb and p130 proteins in vitro and in vivo and that this interaction can be detected in mammalian cells without overexpressing any component. The binding of Raf-1 to Rb occurs subsequent to mitogen stimulation, and this interaction can be detected only in proliferating cells. Raf-1 can inactivate Rb function and can reverse Rb-mediated repression of E2F1 transcription and cell proliferation efficiently. The region of Raf-1 involved in Rb binding spanned residues 1 to 28 at the N terminus, and functional inactivation of Rb required a direct interaction. Serum stimulation of quiescent human fibroblast HSF8 cells led to a partial translocation of Raf-1 into the nucleus, where it colocalized with Rb. Further, Raf-1 was able to phosphorylate Rb in vitro quite efficiently. We believe that the physical interaction of Raf-1 with Rb is a vital step in the growth factor-mediated induction of cell proliferation and that Raf-1 acts as a direct link between cell surface signaling cascades and the cell cycle machinery.

15485920|a|The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) plays a vital role in regulating mammalian cell cycle progression and inactivation of Rb is necessary for entry into S phase. Rb is inactivated by phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells, facilitating the transition from G(1) phase to S phase. Although the signaling events after growth factor stimulation have been well characterized, it is not yet clear how these signals contact the cell cycle machinery. We had found previously that growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells lead to the direct binding of Raf-1 kinase to Rb, leading to its inactivation. Here we show that the Rb-Raf-1 interaction occurs prior to the activation of cyclin and/or cyclin-dependent kinases and facilitates normal cell cycle progression. Raf-1-mediated inactivation of Rb is independent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, as well as cyclin-dependent kinases. Binding of Raf-1 seemed to correlate with the dissociation of the chromatin remodeling protein Brg1 from Rb. Disruption of the Rb-Raf-1 interaction by a nine-amino-acid peptide inhibits Rb phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated capillary tubule formation. Delivery of this peptide by a carrier molecule led to a 79% reduction in tumor volume and a 57% reduction in microvessel formation in nude mice. It appears that Raf-1 links mitogenic signaling to Rb and that disruption of this interaction could aid in controlling proliferative disorders.

16862215|a|Recent studies have shown that nicotine, a component of cigarette smoke, can stimulate the proliferation of non-neuronal cells. While nicotine is not carcinogenic by itself, it has been shown to induce cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Here we find that mitogenic effects of nicotine in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are analogous to those of growth factors and involve activation of Src, induction of Rb-Raf-1 interaction, and phosphorylation of Rb. Analysis of human NSCLC tumors show enhanced levels of Rb-Raf-1 complexes compared with adjacent normal tissue. The mitogenic effects of nicotine were mediated via the alpha7-nAChR subunit and resulted in enhanced recruitment of E2F1 and Raf-1 on proliferative promoters in NSCLC cell lines and human lung tumors. Nicotine stimulation of NSCLC cells caused dissociation of Rb from these promoters. Proliferative signaling via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) required the scaffolding protein beta-arrestin; ablation of beta-arrestin or disruption of the Rb-Raf-1 interaction blocked nicotine-induced proliferation of NSCLCs. Additionally, suppression of beta-arrestin also blocked activation of Src, suppressed levels of phosphorylated ERK, and abrogated Rb-Raf-1 binding in response to nicotine. It appears that nicotine induces cell proliferation by beta-arrestin-mediated activation of the Src and Rb-Raf-1 pathways.

16705168|a|Prohibitin is a growth regulatory gene that has pleiotropic functions in the nucleus, mitochondria, and cytoplasmic compartments. Earlier studies had proposed a role for prohibitin in modulating cellular senescence, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show that senescence induced by DNA-damaging agents causes the localization of prohibitin to specific heterochromatic foci. Prohibitin could bind to heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family proteins and colocalized with HP1gamma in senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. Further, HP1gamma could synergize with prohibitin to repress E2F1-mediated transcriptional activity. The depletion of prohibitin by small interfering RNA or antisense techniques led to a reduction in the senescent phenotype, correlating with a reduced expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase and fewer numbers of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that prohibitin is needed for the recruitment of HP1gamma to E2F1-regulated proliferative promoters, leading to their repression. The ablation of prohibitin prevented the recruitment of HPIgamma, but not Suv39H, to the promoters upon senescence. Prohibitin-mediated recruitment of HP1gamma occurred in only senescent cells, not in quiescent cells; thus, there is a dichotomy in the recruitment of different corepressors by prohibitin, depending on the type of growth arrest. These studies show that prohibitin plays a vital role in inducing cellular senescence.

15665546|a|Explants of rat inferior vena cava embedded in collagen gel and cultured under serum-free conditions produced microvascular outgrowths composed of endothelial cells and pericytes. Exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) dose-dependently stimulated angiogenesis and induced the formation of complex networks of highly branched microvessels. VEGF and the VEGF/bFGF combination also promoted pericyte recruitment. Medium conditioned by untreated vena cava cultures contained endogenous VEGF, and a blocking antibody against VEGF significantly reduced the spontaneous angiogenic response of the explants. Vena cava explants exhibited a greater capacity to form neovessels than aortic rings when tested in parallel cultures from the same animal. When compared with aorta-derived microvessels, neovessels of vena cava origin were longer and had fewer pericytes. Vena cava-aorta cocultures produced extensive anastomosing networks of microvessels, which were primarily contributed by the venous explants. Because of its florid angiogenesis and exquisite sensitivity to angiogenic factor stimulation, the vena cava model may provide novel insights into the regulation of the angiogenic process, which typically initiates from the venous side of the vascular bed. Combined with the aortic ring model, this new assay may also enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of anastomosis formation between the arterial and the venous circulations.

Recently, the Matrigel plug assay has become the method of choice for many studies involving in vivo testing for angiogenesis. In this assay, test angiogenesis-inducing compounds such as bFGF or tumor cells are introduced into cold liquid Matrigel which, after subcutaneous injection, solidifies and permits penetration by host cells and the formation of new blood vessels. Assessment of angiogenesis in the Matrigel plug is achieved either by measuring hemoglobin or by scoring selected regions of histological sections for vascular density. We now describe a modification of the Matrigel plug assay which permits a more precise visualization of the angiogenic reaction, provides directional information, requires no histological analysis, and lends itself to photographic documentation and image analysis protocols. We illustrate the assay by describing dose- and time-dependent responses to tumors of murine and human origin, to angiogenesis-inducing factors such as bFGF (FGF-2) and VEGF and to anti-angiogenic agents such as endostatin. The method has been used as well to demonstrate blood vessel recruitment by embryonic chick aortic arch rudiments. Additionally it has been able to detect strain-dependent differences in susceptibility to angiogenic stimulation.

17260025|a|A chemical biology approach identifies a beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) agonist ARA-211 (Pirbuterol), which causes apoptosis and human tumor regression in animal models. beta2AR stimulation of cAMP formation and protein kinase A (PKA) activation leads to Raf-1 (but not B-Raf) kinase inactivation, inhibition of Mek-1 kinase and decreased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 levels. ARA-211 inhibition of the Raf/Mek/Erk1/2 pathway is mediated by PKA and not exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC). ARA-211 is selective and suppresses P-Erk1/2 but not P-JNK, P-p38, P-Akt or P-STAT3 levels. beta2AR stimulation results in inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, induction of apoptosis in vitro and tumor regression in vivo. beta2AR antagonists and constitutively active Mek-1 rescue from the effects of ARA-211, demonstrating that beta2AR stimulation and Mek kinase inhibition are required for ARA-211 antitumor activity. Furthermore, suppression of growth occurs only in human tumors where ARA-211 induces cAMP formation and decreases P-Erk1/2 levels. Thus, beta2AR stimulation results in significant suppression of malignant transformation in cancers where it blocks the Raf-1/Mek-1/Erk1/2 pathway by a cAMP-dependent activation of PKA but not EPAC.

10075927|a|The E2F transcription factor plays a major role in cell cycle regulation, differentiation and apoptosis, but it is not clear how it is regulated by non-mitogenic signaling cascades. Here we report that two kinases involved in signal transduction have opposite effects on E2F function: the stress-induced kinase JNK1 inhibits E2F1 activity whereas the related p38 kinase reverses Rb-mediated repression of E2F1. JNK1 phosphorylates E2F1 in vitro, and co-transfection of JNK1 reduces the DNA binding activity of E2F1; treatment of cells with TNFalpha had a similar effect. Fas stimulation of Jurkat cells is known to induce p38 kinase and we find a pronounced increase in Rb phosphorylation within 30 min of Fas stimulation. Phosphorylation of Rb correlated with a dissociation of E2F and increased transcriptional activity. The inactivation of Rb by Fas was blocked by SB203580, a p38-specific inhibitor, as well as a dominant-negative p38 construct; cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors as well as dominant-negative cdks had no effect. These results suggest that Fas-mediated inactivation of Rb is mediated via the p38 kinase, independent of cdks. The Rb/E2F-mediated cell cycle regulatory pathway appears to be a normal target for non-mitogenic signaling cascades and could be involved in mediating the cellular effects of such signals.

11075991|a|Multiple primary tumors in pancreatic cancer patients might indicate a genetic predisposition to the development of malignancies. In this study we evaluated whether the mutation rate of the TP53 and p16INK4a genes of pancreatic cancers differs in pancreatic cancer patients with and without multiple primaries. Furthermore, we investigated whether pancreatic cancer patients with multiple primaries carry germline mutations in either p16INK4a, TP53, or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes to detect a genetic alteration that predisposes to the development of different primaries. Fourteen (23%) of 60 pancreatic cancer patients developed histologically verified additional primaries during their lifetimes. Normal constitutional and tumor DNA of the 14 patients with a positive cancer history, but negative family history, were analyzed for p16INK4a, TP53, and BRCA2 mutations by single-strand conformational variant (SSCV) analysis and direct sequencing. Hypermethylation of the p16INK4a promoter region in pancreatic cancers was identified by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR; MSP). Four of 14 pancreatic carcinomas carried somatic intragenic p16INK4a mutations, and another four tumors revealed hypermethylation of the p16INK4a promoter region. Somatic intragenic TP53 mutations were identified in six of 14 tumors. None of the pancreatic cancer patients carried TP53 or BRCA2 germline mutations. In contrast, one of 14 pancreatic cancer patients with multiple primaries carried the p16INK4a mutation A68V in his germline. This mutation was localized in the conserved second ankyrin repeat of p16INK4a and did not occur in 100 control patients. The frequency of somatic TP53 and p16INK4a mutations in pancreatic cancer is similar in patients with and without multiple primaries. TP53 and BRCA2 germline mutations seem not to be significantly associated with the occurrence of multiple primaries in pancreatic cancer patients. However, p16INK4a germline mutations might be causative for tumor development in some pancreatic cancer patients with multiple primaries. The genetic investigation of patients with accumulation of different cancers even without a positive family history may be a new approach for the understanding of the relation of different cancers.

9842975|a|Less than 30% of malignant gliomas respond to adjuvant chemotherapy. Here, we asked whether alterations in the p53 and RB pathways and the expression of six BCL-2 family proteins predicted acute cytotoxicity and clonogenic cell death induced by BCNU, vincristine, cytarabine, teniposide, doxorubicin, camptothecin or beta-lapachone in 12 human malignant glioma cell lines. Neither wild-type p53 status, nor p53 protein accumulation, nor p21 or MDM-2 levels, nor differential expression of BCL-2 family proteins predicted drug sensitivity, except for an association of BAX with higher beta-lapachone sensitivity in acute cytotoxicity assays. p16 protein expression was associated with high doubling time and chemoresistance. We conclude that some important molecular changes, which are involved in the development of gliomas and attributed a role in regulating vulnerability to apoptosis, may not determine the response to chemotherapy in these tumors.

We found that MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells elicited a potent chemotactic response despite their complete lack of a proliferative response to EGF. Antagonists of EGFR ligation, the EGFR kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, and phospholipase C, but not the mitogen-activated protein kinases (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2), blocked MDA-MB-231 chemotaxis. These findings suggest that EGF may influence human breast cancer progression via migratory pathways, the signaling for which appears to be dissociated, at least in part, from the proliferative pathways.

12068308|a|Cancers arise owing to the accumulation of mutations in critical genes that alter normal programmes of cell proliferation, differentiation and death. As the first stage of a systematic genome-wide screen for these genes, we have prioritized for analysis signalling pathways in which at least one gene is mutated in human cancer. The RAS RAF MEK ERK MAP kinase pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals. RAS is mutated to an oncogenic form in about 15% of human cancer. The three RAF genes code for cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by binding RAS. Here we report BRAF somatic missense mutations in 66% of malignant melanomas and at lower frequency in a wide range of human cancers. All mutations are within the kinase domain, with a single substitution (V599E) accounting for 80%. Mutated BRAF proteins have elevated kinase activity and are transforming in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, RAS function is not required for the growth of cancer cell lines with the V599E mutation. As BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that is commonly activated by somatic point mutation in human cancer, it may provide new therapeutic opportunities in malignant melanoma.

15829377|a|The PTEN gene, located on chromosome 10, is a phosphatase in the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3'K)-mediated signal transduction pathway. PTEN inhibits the activation of Akt, a serine-threonine kinase involved in proliferative metabolic and anti-apoptotic pathways, and has tumor suppressor properties. We used a PTEN adenoviral vector, Ad-MMAC, to assess the role of PTEN in the treatment of prostate cancer. Infection of Ad-MMAC in PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells (PTEN deleted, up-regulation of phosphorylated Akt) resulted in PTEN expression and significantly decreased growth compared with Ad-CTR or mock infected cells. Infection of Ad-MMAC did not inhibit the growth of DU-145 cells (wild-type PTEN). Combination therapy with Ad-MMAC and doxorubicin improved the efficacy of PTEN gene therapy in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. These data demonstrate that PTEN gene therapy can effectively treat some prostate cancers that have genomic alterations in PTEN. In others, PTEN gene therapy combined with chemotherapy is more effective.

Here, we show that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) differentially activate Raf, resulting in protection from distinct pathways of apoptosis in human endothelial cells and chick embryo vasculature. bFGF activated Raf-1 via p21-activated protein kinase-1 (PAK-1) phosphorylation of serines 338 and 339, resulting in Raf-1 mitochondrial translocation and endothelial cell protection from the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, independent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK1). In contrast, VEGF activated Raf-1 via Src kinase, leading to phosphorylation of tyrosines 340 and 341 and MEK1-dependent protection from extrinsic-mediated apoptosis. These findings implicate Raf-1 as a pivotal regulator of endothelial cell survival during angiogenesis.

16170185|a|The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays a critical role in transmitting proliferative signals generated by cell surface receptors and cytoplasmic signaling elements to the nucleus. Several important signaling elements of the MAPK pathway, particularly Ras and Raf, are encoded by oncogenes, and as such, their structures and functions can be modified, rendering them constitutively active. Because the MAPK pathway is dysregulated in a notable proportion of human malignancies, many of its aberrant and critical components represent strategic targets for therapeutic development against cancer. Raf, which is an essential serine/threonine kinase constituent of the MAPK pathway and a downstream effector of the central signal transduction mediator Ras, is activated in a wide range of human malignancies by aberrant signaling upstream of the protein (eg, growth factor receptors and mutant Ras) and activating mutations of the protein itself, both of which confer a proliferative advantage. Three isoforms of Raf have been identified, and therapeutics targeting Raf, including small-molecule inhibitors and antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ASON), are undergoing clinical evaluation. The outcomes of these investigations may have far-reaching implications in the management of many types of human cancer. This review outlines the structure and diverse functions of Raf, the rationale for targeting Raf as a therapeutic strategy against cancer, and the present status of various therapeutic approaches including ASONs and small molecules, particularly sorafenib (BAY 43-9006).

Indeed, the pathway is hyperactivated in 30% of all human tumours including prevalent cancers of the colon and lung.

15827342|a|The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK (ERK) pathway is a logical therapeutic target because it represents a common downstream pathway for several key growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors which are often mutated or overexpressed in human cancers. Although considered mainly growth-promoting, in certain contexts, this pathway also seems to be apoptosis-suppressing. Several novel agents targeting this pathway have now been developed and are in clinical trials. One of the most interesting new agents is BAY 43-9006. Although initially developed as a Raf kinase inhibitor, it can also target several other important tyrosine kinases including VEGFR-2, Flt-3, and c-Kit, which contributes to its antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties. To date, encouraging results have been seen with BAY 43-9006, particularly in renal cell cancers which are highly vascular tumors. This review will provide an overview of the ERK signaling pathway in normal and neoplastic tissue, with a specific focus on novel therapies targeting the ERK pathway at the level of Raf kinase.

11350886|a|Raf-1 is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a critical effector of Ras-mediated signal transduction via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Constitutive activation of this pathway directly contributes to malignant transformation in many human tumors. A 20-base phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complementary to c-raf-1 mRNA (ISIS 5132; CGP 69846A) has been shown to specifically suppress Raf-1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. This Phase I trial, involving 22 patients with advanced cancer, was designed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and maximum tolerated dose of ISIS 5132 administration as a weekly 24-h i.v. infusion. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed, and c-raf-1 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assessed using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. This trial defined a maximum tolerated dose of 24 mg/kg/week on this schedule. Two of four patients treated at 30 mg/kg/week had serious adverse events after the first dose of ISIS 5132, including acute hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure and anasarca. There were no major responses documented. Dose-dependent complement activation was demonstrated on this schedule, but not on previously evaluated schedules, of ISIS 5132 administration. In contrast to other trials of ISIS 5132, there appeared to be no consistent suppression of peripheral blood mononuclear cell c-raf-1 mRNA level on this schedule at any of the dose levels analyzed. These data suggest that the efficacy and toxicity profiles of antisense oligonucleotides may be highly dependent on the schedule of administration and support the analysis of the putative molecular target in the evaluation of novel therapeutics.

The introduction and refinement of rapid, high-throughput screening technologies over the past decade has greatly facilitated this targeted discovery and development process. Here, we describe the discovery and continuing development of sorafenib (previously known as BAY 43-9006), the first oral multikinase inhibitor that targets Raf and affects tumour signalling and the tumour vasculature. The discovery cycle of sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer Pharmaceuticals) - from initial screening for a lead compound to FDA approval for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma in December 2005 - was completed in just 11 years, with approval being received approximately 5 years after the initiation of the first Phase I trial.

15753127|a|Raf kinases relay signals inducing proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The Raf-1 isoform has been extensively studied as the upstream kinase linking Ras activation to the MEK/ERK module. Recently, however, genetic experiments have shown that Raf-1 plays an essential role in counteracting apoptosis, and that it does so independently of its ability to activate MEK. By conditional gene ablation, we now show that Raf-1 is required for normal wound healing in vivo and for the migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. Raf-1-deficient cells show a symmetric, contracted appearance, characterized by cortical actin bundles and by a disordered vimentin cytoskeleton. These defects are due to the hyperactivity and incorrect localization of the Rho-effector Rok-alpha to the plasma membrane. Raf-1 physically associates with Rok-alpha in wild-type (WT) cells, and reintroduction of either WT or kinase-dead Raf-1 in knockout fibroblasts rescues their defects in shape and migration. Thus, Raf-1 plays an essential, kinase-independent function as a spatial regulator of Rho downstream signaling during migration.

10523661|a|The inner membrane-bound protein Ras integrates various extracellular signals that are subsequently communicated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus via the Raf/MEK/MAPK cascade. Here we show that the retinoblastoma protein pRb, previously reported to be a nuclear target of this pathway, can in turn influence the activation state of Ras. Rb-deficient fibroblasts display elevated levels (up to 30-fold) of activated Ras during G(1). Expression of wild-type pRb or a number of pRb mutants defective in E2F regulation reverses this effect. We provide evidence that the mid-G(1) activation of Ras in Rb-deficient cells, which occurs at the level of guanine nucleotide binding, differs from that of epidermal growth factor-induced stimulation of Ras, being dependent on protein synthesis. The aberrant levels of Ras activity associated with loss of pRb may be responsible for the differentiation defects in Rb-deficient cells, because suppression of Ras activity in Rb(-/-) fibroblasts restores the transactivation function of MyoD and the expression of a late marker of skeletal muscle differentiation. These data suggest that nuclear-cytoplasmic communication between pRb and Ras is bidirectional.

16738322|a|Inactivation of the Rb-mediated G1 control pathway is a common event found in many types of human tumors. To test how the Rb pathway interacts with other pathways in tumor suppression, we characterized mice with mutations in both the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p18 Ink4c and the lipid phosphatase Pten, which regulates cell growth. The double mutant mice develop a wider spectrum of tumors, including prostate cancer in the anterior and dorsolateral lobes, with nearly complete penetrance and at an accelerated rate. The remaining wild-type allele of Pten was lost at a high frequency in Pten+/- cells but not in p18+/- Pten+/- or p18-/- Pten+/- prostate tumor cells, nor in other Pten+/- tumor cells, suggesting a tissue- and genetic background-dependent haploinsufficiency of Pten in tumor suppression. p18 deletion, CDK4 overexpression, or oncoviral inactivation of Rb family proteins caused activation of Akt/PKB that was recessive to the reduction of PTEN activity. We suggest that p18 and Pten cooperate in tumor suppression by constraining a positive regulatory loop between cell growth and cell cycle control pathways.

Here, we demonstrate a novel role for p16ink4a in replication control that is distinct from that of RB. Specifically, p16ink4a disrupts prereplication complex assembly by inhibiting mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) protein loading in G1, while RB was found to disrupt replication in S phase through attenuation of PCNA function. This influence of p16ink4a on the prereplication complex was dependent on the presence of RB and the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Strikingly, the inhibition of CDK2 activity was not sufficient to prevent the loading of MCM proteins onto chromatin, which supports a model wherein the composite action of multiple G1 CDK complexes regulates prereplication complex assembly. Additionally, p16ink4a attenuated the levels of the assembly factors Cdt1 and Cdc6. The enforced expression of these two licensing factors was sufficient to restore the assembly of the prereplication complex yet failed to promote S-phase progression due to the continued absence of PCNA function. Combined, these data reveal that RB and p16ink4a function through distinct pathways to inhibit the replication machinery and provide evidence that stepwise regulation of CDK activity interfaces with the replication machinery at two discrete execution points.

9062190|a|The Ras proto-oncogene is a central component of mitogenic signal-transduction pathways, and is essential for cells both to leave a quiescent state (G0) and to pass through the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. The mechanism by which Ras signalling regulates cell-cycle progression is unclear, however. Here we report that the retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor protein (Rb), a regulator of G1 exit, functionally links Ras to passage through the G1 phase. Inactivation of Ras in cycling cells caused a decline in cyclin D1 protein levels, accumulation of the hypophosphorylated, growth-suppressive form of Rb, and G1 arrest. When Rb was disrupted either genetically or biochemically, cells failed to arrest in G1 following Ras inactivation. In contrast, inactivation of Ras in quiescent cells prevented growth-factor induction of both immediate-early gene transcription and exit from G0 in an Rb-independent manner. These data suggest that Rb is an essential G1-specific mediator that links Ras-dependent mitogenic signalling to cell-cycle regulation.

11805327|a|Retinal neovascularization is a major cause of blindness and requires the activities of several signaling pathways and multiple cytokines. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) enhances the angiogenic process and is involved in the signaling of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We have demonstrated a dramatic increase in the angiogenic response to oxygen-induced retinal ischemia in transgenic mice overexpressing PKC beta 2 isoform and a significant decrease in retinal neovascularization in PKC beta isoform null mice. The mitogenic action of VEGF, a potent hypoxia-induced angiogenic factor, was increased by 2-fold in retinal endothelial cells by the overexpression of PKC beta 1 or beta 2 isoforms and inhibited significantly by the overexpression of a dominant-negative PKC beta 2 isoform but not by the expression of PKC alpha, delta, and zeta isoforms. Association of PKC beta 2 isoform with retinoblastoma protein was discovered in retinal endothelial cells, and PKC beta 2 isoform increased retinoblastoma phosphorylation under basal and VEGF-stimulated conditions. The potential functional consequences of PKC beta-induced retinoblastoma phosphorylation could include enhanced E2 promoter binding factor transcriptional activity and increased VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation.

15558054|a|In tumors that retain wild-type p53, its tumor-suppressor function is often impaired as a result of the deregulation of HDM-2, which binds to p53 and targets it for proteasomal degradation. We have screened a chemical library and identified a small molecule named RITA (reactivation of p53 and induction of tumor cell apoptosis), which bound to p53 and induced its accumulation in tumor cells. RITA prevented p53-HDM-2 interaction in vitro and in vivo and affected p53 interaction with several negative regulators. RITA induced expression of p53 target genes and massive apoptosis in various tumor cells lines expressing wild-type p53. RITA suppressed the growth of human fibroblasts and lymphoblasts only upon oncogene expression and showed substantial p53-dependent antitumor effect in vivo. RITA may serve as a lead compound for the development of an anticancer drug that targets tumors with wild-type p53.

17121911|a|The cyclin-dependent protein kinases are key regulators of cell cycle progression. Aberrant expression or altered activity of distinct cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes results in escape of cells from cell cycle control, leading to unrestricted cell proliferation. CDK inhibitors have the potential to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells, and identifying small-molecule CDK inhibitors has been a major focus in cancer research. Several CDK inhibitors are entering the clinic, the most recent being selective CDK2 and CDK4 inhibitors. We have identified a diaminopyrimidine compound, R547, which is a potent and selective ATP-competitive CDK inhibitor. In cell-free assays, R547 effectively inhibited CDK1/cyclin B, CDK2/cyclin E, and CDK4/cyclin D1 (K(i) = 1-3 nmol/L) and was inactive (K(i) > 5,000 nmol/L) against a panel of >120 unrelated kinases. In vitro, R547 effectively inhibited the proliferation of tumor cell lines independent of multidrug resistant status, histologic type, retinoblastoma protein, or p53 status, with IC(50)s </= 0.60 mumol/L. The growth-inhibitory activity is characterized by a cell cycle block at G(1) and G(2) phases and induction of apoptosis. R547 reduced phosphorylation of the cellular retinoblastoma protein at specific CDK phosphorylation sites at the same concentrations that induced cell cycle arrest, suggesting a potential pharmacodynamic marker for clinical use. In vivo, R547 showed antitumor activity in all of the models tested to date, including six human tumor xenografts and an orthotopic syngeneic rat model. R547 was efficacious with daily oral dosing as well as with once weekly i.v. dosing in established human tumor models and at the targeted efficacious exposures inhibited phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein in the tumors. The selective kinase inhibition profile and the preclinical antitumor activity of R547 suggest that it may be promising for development for use in the treatment of solid tumors. R547 is currently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials.

11585753|a|The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly overexpressed in many human tumors and provides a new target for anticancer drug development. ZD1839 ("Iressa"), a quinazoline tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for the EGFR, has shown good activity in preclinical studies and in the early phase of clinical trials. However, because it remains unclear which tumor types are the best targets for treatment with this agent, the molecular characteristics that correlate with tumor sensitivity to ZD1839 have been studied. In a panel of human breast cancer and other epithelial tumor cell lines, HER2-overexpressing tumors were particularly sensitive to ZD1839. Growth inhibition of these tumor cell lines was associated with the dephosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, and HER3, accompanied by the loss of association of HER3 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and down-regulation of Akt activity. These studies suggest that HER2-overexpressing tumors are particularly susceptible to the inhibition of HER family tyrosine kinase signaling and suggest novel strategies to treat these particularly aggressive tumors.

The novel bi-aryl urea BAY 43-9006 is a potent inhibitor of Raf-1, a member of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Additional characterization showed that BAY 43-9006 suppresses both wild-type and V599E mutant BRAF activity in vitro. In addition, BAY 43-9006 demonstrated significant activity against several receptor tyrosine kinases involved in neovascularization and tumor progression, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, VEGFR-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, Flt-3, and c-KIT. In cellular mechanistic assays, BAY 43-9006 demonstrated inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in colon, pancreatic, and breast tumor cell lines expressing mutant KRAS or wild-type or mutant BRAF, whereas non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines expressing mutant KRAS were insensitive to inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by BAY 43-9006. Potent inhibition of VEGFR-2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and VEGFR-3 cellular receptor autophosphorylation was also observed for BAY 43-9006. Once daily oral dosing of BAY 43-9006 demonstrated broad-spectrum antitumor activity in colon, breast, and non-small-cell lung cancer xenograft models. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a close association between inhibition of tumor growth and inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1/2 phosphorylation in two of three xenograft models examined, consistent with inhibition of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in some but not all models. Additional analyses of microvessel density and microvessel area in the same tumor sections using antimurine CD31 antibodies demonstrated significant inhibition of neovascularization in all three of the xenograft models. These data demonstrate that BAY 43-9006 is a novel dual action RAF kinase and VEGFR inhibitor that targets tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis.

The algorithm can be applied to molecules with large (several hundred) conformational models. Results from the application of this algorithm to three data sets are discussed: PAF antagonists, HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and HIV protease inhibitors. Of particular interest is a common configuration identified for a set of HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors; this configuration is shared by two new, potent inhibitors that were recently described in the literature.

We developed a novel program, SCAMPI (statistical classification of activities of molecules for pharmacophore identification), for this purpose by combining a fast conformation search with recursive partitioning, a data-mining technique, which can easily handle large data sets. The pharmacophore identification process is designed to run recursively, and the conformation spaces are resampled under the constraints of the evolving pharmacophore model. This program is capable of deriving pharmacophores from a data set of 1000-2000 compounds, with thousands of conformations generated for each compound and in less than 1 day of computational time. For two test data sets, the identified pharmacophores are consistent with the known results from the literature.

15865060|a|Pharmacophore methods provide a way of establishing a structure activity relationship for a series of known active ligands. Often, there are several plausible hypotheses that could explain the same set of ligands and, in such cases, it is important that the chemist is presented with alternatives that can be tested with different synthetic compounds. Existing pharmacophore methods involve either generating an ensemble of conformers and considering each conformer of each ligand in turn or exploring conformational space on-the-fly. The ensemble methods tend to produce a large number of hypotheses and require considerable effort to analyse the results, whereas methods that vary conformation on-the-fly typically generate a single solution that represents one possible hypothesis, even though several might exist. We describe a new method for generating multiple pharmacophore hypotheses with full conformational flexibility being explored on-the-fly. The method is based on multiobjective evolutionary algorithm techniques and is designed to search for an ensemble of diverse yet plausible overlays which can then be presented to the chemist for further investigation.

All molecules are described by the established feature tree descriptor, which is derived from a topological molecular graph. A new pairwise alignment algorithm leads to a consistent topological molecular alignment based on chemically reasonable matching of corresponding functional groups. These multiple feature tree models find application in ligand-based virtual screening to identify new lead structures for chemical optimization. Retrospective virtual screening with MTree models generated for angiotensin-converting enzyme and the alpha1a receptor on a large candidate database yielded enrichment factors up to 71 for the first 1% of the screened database. MTree models outperformed database searches using single feature trees in terms of hit rates and quality and additionally identified alternative molecular scaffolds not included in any of the query molecules. Furthermore, relevant molecular features, which are known to be important for affinity to the target, are identified by this new methodology.

Given as input a set of molecules that exhibit some common biological activity, MPHIL identifies the smallest 3D pattern of pharmacophore points that has at least m (a user-defined parameter) points in common with each of the input molecules. The program thus differs from existing programs for pharmacophore mapping in that it does not require all of the molecules to share exactly the same pattern of points, although it will find such a common pattern if it does, indeed, exist. MPHIL uses a genetic algorithm (GA) approach in which an initial, and very rapid, GA is used to suggest possible combinations of points that are then processed by the second GA to yield the final 3D pattern.

8789195|a|A genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed for the superimposition of sets of flexible molecules. Molecules are represented by a chromosome that encodes angles of rotation about flexible bonds and mappings between hydrogen-bond donor proton, acceptor lone pair and ring centre features in pairs of molecules. The molecule with the smallest number of features in the data set is used as a template, onto which the remaining molecules are fitted with the objective of maximising structural equivalences. The fitness function of the GA is a weighted combination of: (i) the number and the similarity of the features that have been overlaid in this way; (ii) the volume integral of the overlay; and (iii) the van der Waals energy of the molecular conformations defined by the torsion angles encoded in the chromosomes. The algorithm has been applied to a number of pharmacophore elucidation problems, i.e., angiotensin II receptor antagonists, Leu-enkephalin and a hybrid morphine molecule, 5-HT1D agonists, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, 5-HT3 antagonists, dopamine D2 antagonists, dopamine reuptake blockers and FKBP12 ligands.

12926853|a|We present a new method (fFLASH) for the virtual screening of compound databases that is based on explicit three-dimensional molecular superpositions. fFLASH takes the torsional flexibility of the database molecules fully into account, and can deal with an arbitrary number of conformation-dependent molecular features. The method utilizes a fragmentation-reassembly approach which allows for an efficient sampling of the conformational space. A fast clique-based pattern matching algorithm generates alignments of pairs of adjacent molecular fragments on the rigid query molecule that are subsequently reassembled to complete database molecules. Using conventional molecular features (hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, charges, and hydrophobic groups) we show that fFLASH is able to rapidly produce accurate alignments of medium-sized drug-like molecules. Experiments with a test database containing a diverse set of 1780 drug-like molecules (including all conformers) have shown that average query processing times of the order of 0.1 seconds per molecule can be achieved on a PC.

9334902|a|We present an efficient algorithm for the structural alignment of medium-sized organic molecules. The algorithm has been developed for applications in 3D QSAR and in receptor modeling. The method assumes one of the molecules, the reference ligand, to be presented in the conformation that it adopts inside the receptor pocket. The second molecule, the test ligand, is considered to be flexible, and is assumed to be given in an arbitrary low-energy conformation. Ligand flexibility is modeled by decomposing the test ligand into molecular fragments, such that ring systems are completely contained in a single fragment. Conformations of fragments and torsional angles of single bonds are taken from a small finite set, which depends on the fragment and bond, respectively. The algorithm superimposes a distinguished base fragment of the test ligand onto a suitable region of the reference ligand and then attaches the remaining fragments of the test ligand in a step-by-step fashion. During this process, a scoring function is optimized that encompasses bonding terms and terms accounting for steric overlap as well as for similarity of chemical properties of both ligands. The algorithm has been implemented in the FLEXS system. To validate the quality of the produced results, we have selected a number of examples for which the mutual superposition of two ligands is experimentally given by the comparison of the binding geometries known from the crystal structures of their corresponding protein-ligand complexes. On more than two-thirds of the test examples the algorithm produces rms deviations of the predicted versus the observed conformation of the test ligand below 1.5 A. The run time of the algorithm on a single problem instance is a few minutes on a common-day workstation. The overall goal of this research is to drastically reduce run times, while limiting the inaccuracies of the model and the computation to a tolerable level.

9804690|a|If no structural information about a particular target protein is available, methods of rational drug design try to superimpose putative ligands with a given reference, e.g., an endogenous ligand. The goal of such structural alignments is, on the one hand, to approximate the binding geometry and, on the other hand, to provide a relative ranking of the ligands with respect to their similarity. An accurate superposition is the prerequisite of subsequent exploitation of ligand data by either 3D QSAR analyses, pharmacophore hypotheses, or receptor modeling. We present the automatic method FLEXS for structurally superimposing pairs of ligands, approximating their putative binding site geometry. One of the ligands is treated as flexible, while the other one, used as a reference, is kept rigid. FLEXS is an incremental construction procedure. The molecules to be superimposed are partitioned into fragments. Starting with placements of a selected anchor fragment, computed by two alternative approaches, the remaining fragments are added iteratively. At each step, flexibility is considered by allowing the respective added fragment to adopt a discrete set of conformations. The mean computing time per test case is about 1:30 min on a common-day workstation. FLEXS is fast enough to be used as a tool for virtual ligand screening. A database of typical drug molecules has been screened for potential fibrinogen receptor antagonists. FLEXS is capable of retrieving all ligands assigned to platelet aggregation properties among the first 20 hits. Furthermore, the program suggests additional interesting candidates, likely to be active at the same receptor. FLEXS proves to be superior to commonly used retrieval techniques based on 2D fingerprint similarities. The accuracy of computed superpositions determines the relevance of subsequently performed ligand analyses. In order to validate the quality of FLEXS alignments, we attempted to reproduce a set of 284 mutual superpositions derived from experimental data on 76 protein-ligand complexes of 14 proteins. The ligands considered cover the whole range of drug-size molecules from 18 to 158 atoms (PDB codes: 3ptb, 2er7). The performance of the algorithm critically depends on the sizes of the molecules to be superimposed. The limitations are clearly demonstrated with large peptidic inhibitors in the HIV and the endothiapepsin data set. Problems also occur in the presence of multiple binding modes (e.g., elastase and human rhinovirus). The most convincing results are achieved with small- and medium-sized molecules (as, e.g., the ligands of trypsin, thrombin, and dihydrofolate reductase). In more than half of the entire test set, we achieve rms deviations between computed and observed alignment of below 1.5 A. This underlines the reliability of FLEXS-generated alignments.

8097240|a|In the absence of a 3D structure of the target biomolecule, to propose the 3D requirements for a small molecule to exhibit a particular bioactivity, one must supply both a bioactive conformation and a superposition rule for every active compound. Our strategy identifies both simultaneously. We first generate and optimize all low-energy conformations by any suitable method. For each conformation we then use ALADDIN to calculate the location of points to be considered as part of the superposition. These points include atoms in the molecule and projections from the molecule to hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors or charged groups in the binding site. These positions and the relative energy of each conformation are the input to our new program DISCO. It uses a clique-detection method to find superpositions that contain at least one conformation of each molecule and user-specified numbers of point types and chirality. DISCO is fast; for example, it takes about 1 min CPU to propose pharmacophores from 21 conformations of seven molecules. We typically run DISCO several times to compare alternative pharmacophore maps. For D2 dopamine agonists DISCO shows that the newer 2-aminothiazoles fit the traditional pharmacophore. Using site points correctly identifies the bioactive enantiomers of indoles to compare with catechols whereas using only ligand points leads to selecting the inactive enantiomer for the pharmacophore map. In addition, DISCO reproduces pharmacophore maps of benzodiazepines in the literature and proposes subtle improvements. Our experience suggests that clique-detection methods will find many applications in computational chemistry and computer-assisted molecular design.

8786414|a|We present an algorithm for placing molecular fragments into the active site of a receptor. A molecular fragment is defined as a connected part of a molecule containing only complete ring systems. The algorithm is part of a docking tool, called FLEXX, which is currently under development at GMD. The overall goal is to provide means of automatically computing low-energy conformations of the ligand within the active site, with an accuracy approaching the limitations of experimental methods for resolving molecular structures and within a run time that allows for docking large sets of ligands. The methods by which we plan to achieve this goal are the explicit exploitation of molecular flexibility of the ligand and the incorporation of physicochemical properties of the molecules. The algorithm for fragment placement, which is the topic of this paper, is based on pattern recognition techniques and is able to predict a small set of possible positions of a molecular fragment with low flexibility within seconds on a workstation. In most cases, a placement with rms deviation below 1.0 A with respect to the X-ray structure is found among the 10 highest ranking solutions, assuming that the receptor is given in the bound conformation.

17051338|a|Alignment of multiple ligands based on shared pharmacophoric and pharmacosteric features is a long-recognized challenge in drug discovery and development. This is particularly true when the spatial overlap between structures is incomplete, in which case no good template molecule is likely to exist. Pair-wise rigid ligand alignment based on linear assignment (the LAMDA algorithm) has the potential to address this problem (Richmond et al. in J Mol Graph Model 23:199-209, 2004). Here we present the version of LAMDA embodied in the GALAHAD program, which carries out multi-way alignments by iterative construction of hypermolecules that retain the aggregate as well as the individual attributes of the ligands. We have also generalized the cost function from being purely atom-based to being one that operates on ionic, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and steric features. Finally, we have added the ability to generate useful partial-match 3D search queries from the hypermolecules obtained. By running frozen conformations through the GALAHAD program, one can utilize the extended version of LAMDA to generate pharmacophores and pharmacosteres that agree well with crystal structure alignments for a range of literature datasets, with minor adjustments of the default parameters generating even better models. Allowing for inclusion of partial match constraints in the queries yields pharmacophores that are consistently a superset of full-match pharmacophores identified in previous analyses, with the additional features representing points of potentially beneficial interaction with the target.

18424800|a|Predicting molecular interactions is a major goal in rational drug design. Pharmacophore, which is the spatial arrangement of features that is essential for a molecule to interact with a specific target receptor, is an important model for achieving this goal. We present a freely available web server, named PharmaGist, for pharmacophore detection. The employed method is ligand based. Namely, it does not require the structure of the target receptor. Instead, the input is a set of structures of drug-like molecules that are known to bind to the receptor. The output consists of candidate pharmacophores that are computed by multiple flexible alignment of the input ligands. The method handles the flexibility of the input ligands explicitly and in deterministic manner within the alignment process. PharmaGist is also highly efficient, where a typical run with up to 32 drug-like molecules takes seconds to a few minutes on a stardard PC. Another important characteristic is the capability of detecting pharmacophores shared by different subsets of input molecules. This capability is a key advantage when the ligands belong to different binding modes or when the input contains outliers. The webserver has a user-friendly interface available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PharmaGist.

16597249|a|Recognition of binding patterns common to a set of protein structures is important for recognition of function, prediction of binding, and drug design. We consider protein binding sites represented by a set of 3D points with assigned physico-chemical and geometrical properties important for protein-ligand interactions. We formulate the multiple binding site alignment problem as detection of the largest common set of such 3D points. We discuss the computational problem of multiple common point set detection and, particularly, the matching problem in K-partite-epsilon graphs, where K partitions are associated with K structures and edges are defined between epsilon-close points. We show that the K-partite-epsilon matching problem is NP-hard in the Euclidean space with dimension larger than one. Consequently, we show that the largest common point set problem between three point sets is NP-hard. On the practical side, we present a novel computational method, MultiBind, for recognition of binding patterns common to a set of protein structures. It performs a multiple alignment between protein binding sites in the absence of overall sequence, fold, or binding partner similarity. Despite the NP-hardness results, in our applications, we practically overcome the exponential number of multiple alignment combinations by applying an efficient branchand- bound filtering procedure. We show applications of MultiBind to several biological targets. The method recognizes patterns which are responsible for binding small molecules, such as estradiol, ATP/ANP, and transition state analogues.

14759747|a|Reports in the scientific literature and lay press have suggested that computer users are at increased risk of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Early studies often found elevated rates of MSD outcomes among keyboard users when compared to non-users. Attention soon focused on specific aspects of keyboard work that might be responsible for the observed rate increase. In this review, the epidemiological evidence examining associations between MSD outcomes and computer user posture and keyboard use intensity (hours of computer use per day or per week) are examined. Results of epidemiological studies of posture and MSD outcomes have not been entirely consistent. Reasons for the inconsistency in results include cross-sectional study design (with possible failure to assure that measured exposure preceded health effect), imprecision of posture measures used, and difficulties involved in analyzing multiple related variables. Despite the inconsistencies, it appears from the literature that posture is an independent risk factor of modest magnitude for MSDs among computer users. It appears that lowering the height of the keyboard to or below the height of the elbow and resting the arms on the desk surface or chair armrests is associated with reduced risk of neck and shoulder MSDs. Results of epidemiological studies examining computer use (hours keying per day or per week) are more consistent than those examining posture, although some inconsistency is observed. Reasons for the inconsistency include possible selective survival bias resulting from cross-sectional study design, differences in exposure categorization, and possible interaction with other exposure variables. Overall, the literature shows that daily or weekly hours of computer use is more consistently associated with hand and arm MSDs than with neck and shoulder MSDs.

12963076|a|This quasi-experimental field study examined the efficacy of a safety self-management process to increase safety-related work practices in mining operations.After a 7-week baseline, 15 miners participated in a safety self-management training and education presentation. The participants in a prebehavior condition (n=8) recorded their intentions to engage in specific percentages of safety-related work behaviors before starting their shift for the day. In contrast, participants in a postbehavior condition (n=7) recorded their percentages of safety-related work behaviors after their shift for the day.During withdrawal (4 weeks), the miners did not complete any self-monitoring forms. Based on 10,905 behavioral observations, safety self-management was effective at increasing the frequency of safety-related behavior (p<.05). For the prebehavior condition, the mean percent safe score across three target behaviors increased 34.8% during intervention. Similarly, in the postbehavior condition, the mean percent safe score across three target behaviors increased 40.1% during intervention.The results suggest that employees who work in relative isolation or have little oversight, compared to traditional industrial workers, may benefit from a process by which they can systematically observe themselves.

9494433|a|Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a cumulative trauma disorder of the hand and wrist, is one of the most common disabling injuries experienced by video-display terminal (VDT) operators. The purpose of this study was to develop a theoretically based operational quantitative predictive model of the risk of work-related CTS among VDT operators. A total of 100 female VDT operators, who performed a variety of office functions, were studied at a major midwestern university. Data were collected on job exposure, anthropometry and posture factors using questionnaires, direct observation and video-recording. Discriminant analysis and logistic regression were performed to develop the operational models. The results of the study indicated the following: (1) percentage of workday working with a VDT was the most significant factor and accounted for 60% of the variance explaining the causation of musculoskeletal discomforts associated with CTS; (2) discriminant function with six variables (i.e. work duration, trunk incline, wrist extension, wrist ulnar deviation, overall anthropometric measure, weighted anthropometric measure) correctly classified 73% of the CTS group and 72% of the non-CTS group; (3) using the logistic regression model, the probabilities associated with changes in the predictive variables as affecting CTS risk are presented such that increasing the daily work duration from 1 h to 4 h increases the probability of CTS risk from 0.45 to 0.92. The results of the study suggest that the main causation of CTS is job design, the secondary (and lesser cause) is posture associated with the workplace design and the least contributing factor to CTS causation is the individual's anthropometric make-up.

During baseline many students riding their bikes to and from school did not wear their helmets or wore them incorrectly. A program that consisted of peer data collection of correct helmet use, education on how to wear a bicycle helmet correctly, peer goal setting, public posting of the percentage of correct helmet use, and shared reinforcers, all of which were implemented by the school resource officer, increased afternoon helmet use and afternoon correct helmet use in all three schools. Probe data collected a distance from all three schools indicated that students did not remove their helmets once they were no longer in close proximity to the school, and probe data collected in the morning at two of the schools showed that the behavior change transferred to the morning.

17183242|a|Public health law is an emerging field in U.S. public health practice. The 20th century proved the indispensability of law to public health, as demonstrated by the contribution of law to each of the century's 10 great public health achievements. Former CDC Director Dr. William Foege has suggested that law, along with epidemiology, is an essential tool in public health practice. Public health laws are any laws that have important consequences for the health of defined populations. They derive from federal and state constitutions; statutes, and other legislative enactments; agency rules and regulations; judicial rulings and case law; and policies of public bodies. Government agencies that apply public health laws include agencies officially designated as "public health agencies," as well as health-care, environmental protection, education, and law enforcement agencies, among others.

17386331|a|The independent, nonfederal Task Force on Community Preventive Services (Task Force), which directs development of the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide), has conducted a systematic review of published scientific evidence concerning the effectiveness of laws and policies that facilitate the transfer of juveniles to the adult criminal justice system, on either preventing or reducing violence (1) among those youth who experience the adult criminal system or (2) in the juvenile population as a whole. This review focuses on interpersonal violence. Violence may lead to the juvenile's initial arrest and entry into the justice system and, for those who are arrested, may be committed subsequent to exiting the justice system. Here transfer is defined as the placement of juveniles aged less than 18 years under the jurisdiction of the adult criminal justice system, rather than the juvenile justice system, following arrest. Using the methods developed by the Community Guide to conduct a systematic review of literature and provide recommendations to public health decision makers, the review team found that transferring juveniles to the adult justice system generally increases, rather than decreases, rates of violence among transferred youth. Evidence was insufficient for the Task Force on Community Preventive Services to determine the effect of such laws and policies in reducing violent behavior in the overall juvenile population. Overall, the Task Force recommends against laws or policies facilitating the transfer of juveniles from the juvenile to the adult judicial system for the purpose of reducing violence.

15674880|a|Laws restricting sales of tobacco products to minors exist in many countries, but young people may still purchase cigarettes easily.The review assesses the effects of interventions to reduce underage access to tobacco by deterring shopkeepers from making illegal sales.We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction group trials register, MEDLINE and EMBASE. Date of the most recent searches: September 2004.We included controlled trials and uncontrolled studies with pre- and post intervention assessment of interventions to change retailers' behaviour. The outcomes were changes in retailer compliance with legislation (assessed by test purchasing), changes in young people's smoking behaviour, and perceived ease of access to tobacco products.One reviewer prescreened studies for relevance, and both reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion. One reviewer extracted data from included studies and the second checked them. Study designs and types of intervention were heterogeneous so results were synthesized narratively, with greater weight given to controlled studies.We identified 34 studies of which 14 had data from a control group for at least one outcome. Giving retailers information was less effective in reducing illegal sales than active enforcement or multicomponent educational strategies, or both. No strategy achieved complete, sustained compliance. In three controlled trials, there was little effect of intervention on youth perceptions of access or prevalence of smoking.Interventions with retailers can lead to large decreases in the number of outlets selling tobacco to youths. However, few of the communities studied in this review achieved sustained levels of high compliance. This may explain why there is limited evidence for an effect of intervention on youth perception of ease of access to tobacco, and on smoking behaviour.

15010446|a|Modifiable behavioral risk factors are leading causes of mortality in the United States. Quantifying these will provide insight into the effects of recent trends and the implications of missed prevention opportunities.To identify and quantify the leading causes of mortality in the United States.Comprehensive MEDLINE search of English-language articles that identified epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory studies linking risk behaviors and mortality. The search was initially restricted to articles published during or after 1990, but we later included relevant articles published in 1980 to December 31, 2002. Prevalence and relative risk were identified during the literature search. We used 2000 mortality data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify the causes and number of deaths. The estimates of cause of death were computed by multiplying estimates of the cause-attributable fraction of preventable deaths with the total mortality data.Actual causes of death.The leading causes of death in 2000 were tobacco (435 000 deaths; 18.1% of total US deaths), poor diet and physical inactivity (365 000 deaths; 15.2%) [corrected], and alcohol consumption (85 000 deaths; 3.5%). Other actual causes of death were microbial agents (75 000), toxic agents (55 000), motor vehicle crashes (43 000), incidents involving firearms (29 000), sexual behaviors (20 000), and illicit use of drugs (17 000).These analyses show that smoking remains the leading cause of mortality. However, poor diet and physical inactivity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of death. These findings, along with escalating health care costs and aging population, argue persuasively that the need to establish a more preventive orientation in the US health care and public health systems has become more urgent.

Second, we discuss activities that are essential to protecting the public's health but whose impact is difficult to measure. Third, we propose general characteristics of useful measures of the public's health.

In an effort to raise immunization rates, New Jersey in 1999 adopted a regulation requiring hospitals to offer pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations to all inpatients aged 65 and over. This study examined the effect of implementation strategies on immunization rates within hospitals in 2000 and 2001.Hospital infection control directors were surveyed and random chart review was conducted from a stratified sample of hospitals. The infection control director's assessment of their institution's success was a major outcome measure.Relatively few respondents thought their hospital has been successful in implementing new immunization protocols. Approximately 67% responded that they did not think physicians agreed with the "scope and nature" of the regulation. Physician attitudes led the list of barriers to implementation cited by respondents. Chart review revealed moderate amounts of immunization assessment performed by nurses, but virtually no evidence of physicians' orders for immunization.Thus far, there is little evidence that the New Jersey regulation has resulted in a meaningful change in pneumococcal or influenza vaccination practices.

This price avoidance behaviour costs states excise tax money and dampens the health impact of higher cigarette prices.Telephone survey data from 3602 US smokers who were originally in the COMMIT (community intervention trial for smoking cessation) study were analysed to assess cigarette purchase patterns, use of discount/generic cigarettes, and use of coupons.59% reported engaging in a high price avoidance strategy, including 34% who regularly purchase from a low or untaxed venue, 28% who smoke a discount/generic cigarette brand, and 18% who report using cigarette coupons more frequently that they did five years ago. The report of engaging in a price avoidance strategy was associated with living within 40 miles of a state or Indian reservation with lower cigarette excise taxes, higher average cigarette consumption, white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, and female sex.Data from this study indicate that most smokers are price sensitive and seek out measures to purchase less expensive cigarettes, which may decrease future cessation efforts.

16953811|a|Systematic reviews have become an important methodology in the United Kingdom by which research informs health policy, and their use now extends beyond evidence-based medicine to evidence-based public health and, particularly, health inequalities policies. This article reviews the limitations of systematic reviews as stand-alone tools for this purpose and suggests a complementary approach to make better use of the evidence. That is, systematic reviews and other sources of evidence should be incorporated into a wider analytical framework, the public health regime (defined here as the specific legislative, social, political, and economic structures that have an impact on both public health and the appropriateness and effectiveness of public health interventions adopted). At the national level this approach would facilitate analysis at all levels of the policy framework, countering the current focus on individual interventions. It could also differentiate at the international level between those policies and interventions that are effective in different contexts and are therefore potentially generalizable and those that depend on particular conditions for success.

9918573|a|A major obstacle in the development of red cell substitutes has been overcoming their short circulation persistence. In this study, distearoyl phosphoethanolamine polyethylene glycol 5000 (PEG-PE) (10 mol%) was added to the formulation of liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin (LEH) to decrease reticuloendothelial system uptake and prolong LEH circulation persistence. PEG-LEH was radiolabeled with technetium-99m, infused into rabbits (25% of blood pool at 1 ml/min) (n = 5), and monitored by scintigraphic imaging at various times out to 48 h. At 48 h, animals were sacrificed, and tissue samples were collected for counting in a scintillation well counter. Tissue distribution data at 48 h revealed that 51.3 +/- 3.4% of the technetium-99m-PEG-LEH remained in circulation, a greater than 3-fold increase in the circulation half-life compared with circulation half-lives previously reported for non-PEG-containing LEH formulations. The liver had the greatest accumulation at 48 h (12.7 +/- 0.7%), followed by bone marrow (6.2 +/- 0.1%), whereas the spleen had only 1.4 +/- 0.2%. The addition of PEG-PE to the LEH formulation greatly prolongs the circulation persistence of LEH and represents a significant step in the development of red cell substitutes with prolonged oxygen delivery.

For instance, polylactic acid was used as membrane material to microencapsulate biologically active materials. Asparaginase microencapsulated within polylactic acids functions effectively in converting external asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonium. By variations in permeability characteristics, insulin microencapsulated within polylactic acid can be released at pre-adjusted rates. Thus, release rates of 50% in 5 hours, 50% in 20 hours, and 2.5% in 24 hours have been demonstrated. Drugs and vaccines have also been similarily microencapsulated. The advantage of the biodegradable microcapsules is the ability of the body to convert the injected polymer material to normal body metabolites (e.g., CO2 and H2O in the case of polylactic acid) after completion of its function.

7994414|a|We used biodegradable polymers like polylactic acid, poly-isobutylcyanoacrylate and others to prepare nanocapsules containing hemoglobin. We prepared the optimal mean diameters of between 0.08 to 0.12 micron (80-120 nm). They are spherical and homogeneous. The membrane thickness is 0.005-0.015 micron (5-15nm). With different formulation, the hemoglobin contents in the particles may be varied from 30-45%. Phospholipid is not required in bovine hemoglobin. It is required for human hemoglobin in order to retain cofactors required for optimal P50. The P50 of the biodegradable polymer membrane containing bovine hemoglobin was between 27-29 mmHg. This is the same P50 as bovine hemoglobin used in the preparation. Thus the procedure of preparation did not damage hemoglobin.

18979292|a|This study is to investigate the long-term effects of PEG-PLA nano artificial cells containing hemoglobin (NanoRBC) on renal function and renal histology after 1/3 blood volume top loading in rats. The experimental rats received one of the following infusions: NanoRBC in Ringer lactate, Ringer lactate, stroma-free hemoglobin (SFHB), polyhemoglobin (PolyHb), autologous rat whole blood (rat RBC). Blood samples were taken before infusions and on days 1, 7 and 21 after infusions for biochemistry analysis. Rats were sacrificed on day 21 after infusions and kidneys were excised for histology examination. Infusion of SFHB induced significant decrease in renal function damage evidenced by elevated serum urea, creatinine and uric acid throughout the 21 days. Kidney histology in SFHb infusion group revealed focal tubular necrosis and intraluminal cellular debris in the proximal tubules, whereas the glomeruli were not observed damaged. In all the other groups, NanoRBC, PolyHb, Ringer lactate and rat RBC, there were no abnormalities in renal biochemistry or histology. In conclusion, injection of NanoRBC did not have adverse effects on renal function nor renal histology.

The phages were distributed into 4 different immunity groups. The basic criteria used for selection of transposable phages have been: 1) Morphology of a phage particle, host range, similar inactivation with antiserum; 2) Similar sizes of phage genomes; 3) The presence of a variable non-phage nucleotide sequences covalently linked to phage genome DNA, which could be identified using restriction endonucleases or by heteroduplex analyses. The DNAs of the new phages are resistant to treatment with BamH1 endonuclease, like the DNAs of phages D3112, B39 and B3 described earlier. The restriction maps of the phage genomes are constructed.

15047956|a|Chronic pulmonary infection with transmissible Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been reported, raising issues of cross infection and patient segregation. The first such strain to be described (the Liverpool epidemic strain, LES) is now widespread in many UK CF centres. However, whether such infection carries a worse prognosis is unknown. To address this, the clinical course of a group of CF patients chronically infected by LES was compared with that in patients harbouring unique strains.Using P aeruginosa strain genotyping, two cohorts of CF patients attending the Liverpool CF service were identified who were LES positive or negative in 1998 and remained so until 2002. From these, two groups of 12 patients were matched in 1998 for age, spirometric parameters, and nutritional state and their clinical course was followed for 5 years. Patients chronically infected with Burkholderia cepacia were excluded.Patients chronically infected with LES had a greater annual loss of lung function than those not chronically infected by LES (mean difference between groups -4.4% (95% CI -8.1 to -0.9; p<0.02)), and by 2002 their percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was worse (mean 65.0% v 82.6%, p<0.03). Their nutritional state also deteriorated over the study period (mean difference between groups in body mass index -0.7 (95% CI -1.2 to -0.2; p<0.01)), such that by 2002 they were malnourished compared with LES negative patients (mean BMI 19.4 v 22.7, p<0.02).Chronic infection with the Liverpool epidemic P aeruginosa strain in CF patients confers a worse prognosis than infection with unique strains alone, confirming the need for patient segregation. Since this strain is common in many CF units, strain identification in all CF centres is essential. This can only be carried out using genomic typing methods.

11481492|a|Protein glycosylation has been long recognized as an important posttranslational modification process in eukaryotic cells. Glycoproteins, predominantly secreted or surface localized, have also been identified in bacteria. We have identified a cluster of 14 genes, encoding the determinants of the flagellin glycosylation machinery in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK, which we called the flagellin glycosylation island. Flagellin glycosylation can be detected only in bacteria expressing the a-type flagellin sequence variants, and the survey of 30 P. aeruginosa isolates revealed coinheritance of the a-type flagellin genes with at least one of the flagellin glycosylation island genes. Expression of the b-type flagellin in PAK, an a-type strain carrying the glycosylation island, did not lead to glycosylation of the b-type flagellin of PAO1, suggesting that flagellins expressed by b-type bacteria not only lack the glycosylation island, they cannot serve as substrates for glycosylation. Providing the entire glycosylation island of PAK, including its a-type flagellin in a flagellin mutant of a b-type strain, results in glycosylation of the heterologous flagellin. These results suggest that some or all of the 14 genes on the glycosylation island are the genes that are missing from strain PAO1 to allow glycosylation of an appropriate flagellin. Inactivation of either one of the two flanking genes present on this island abolished flagellin glycosylation. Based on the limited homologies of these gene products with enzymes involved in glycosylation, we propose that the island encodes similar proteins involved in synthesis, activation, or polymerization of sugars that are necessary for flagellin glycosylation.

Most of the research on polyketide synthesis in bacteria has focused on compounds synthesized by Streptomyces or other actinomycetes; however, plant-associated pseudomonads also produce a variety of compounds via the polyketide pathway including the phytotoxin coronatine, the antibiotic mupirocin, and the antifungal compounds pyoluteorin and 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. This review focuses on the mode of action, regulation, biosynthesis, and genetics of these four compounds and the potential use of Pseudomonas-derived polyketide synthases in the generation of novel compounds with unique activities.

18490781|a|Novel therapies to target lung inflammation are predicted to improve the lives of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) but specific antiinflammatory targets have not been identified. The goal of this study was to establish whether TLR5 signaling is the key molecular pathway mediating lung inflammation in CF, and to determine whether strategies to inhibit TLR5 can reduce the damaging inflammatory response. The innate immune responses were analyzed in both airway epithelial cells and primary PBMCs from CF patients and matched controls. Additionally, 151 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from CF patients were assessed for motility and capacity to activate TLR5. Blood and airway cells from CF patients produced significantly more proinflammatory cytokine than did control cells following exposure to the CF pathogens P. aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex (p < 0.001). Stimulation with pure TLR ligands demonstrated that TLR signaling appears to mediate the excessive cytokine production occurring in CF. Using complementary approaches involving both neutralizing Ab targeting TLR5 and flagellin-deficient bacteria, we established that inhibition of TLR5 abolished the damaging inflammatory response generated by CF airway cells following exposure to P. aeruginosa (p < 0.01). The potential therapeutic value of TLR5 inhibition was further supported by our demonstration that 75% of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa retained TLR5 activating capacity during chronic CF lung infection. These studies identify the innate immune receptor TLR5 as a novel antiinflammatory target for reducing damaging lung inflammation in CF.

16048929|a|With few novel antimicrobials in development, resistance to the current selection of antibiotics increasingly encroaches on our ability to control microbial infections. One limitation in our understanding of the basis of the constraints on current therapies is our poor understanding of antibiotic interactions with bacteria on a global scale. Custom DNA microarrays were used to characterize the response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone commonly used in therapy against chronic infections by this intrinsically resistant bacterium. Of the approximately 5,300 open reading frames (ORFs) on the array, 941 genes showed statistically significant (P </= 0.05) differential expression in response to 0.3x MIC of ciprofloxacin; 554 were promoted and 387 were repressed. Most striking among the responsive genes was the region between PA0613 and PA0648, which codes for the bacteriophage-like R2/F2 pyocins. In this region, virtually every ORF was increased by 0.3x MIC of ciprofloxacin and even more dramatically up-regulated (7- to 19-fold) following treatment with 1x MIC of ciprofloxacin. Pyocin gene expression was confirmed with lux reporter mutants and real-time PCR studies; pyocin-like particles were also present in transmission electron micrographs of supernatants from cells treated with 1x MIC of ciprofloxacin. Interestingly, mutants in this region exhibited >/=8-fold-increased resistance to ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones, demonstrating that this region is a susceptibility determinant. Since this region is known to be variably present in the genomes of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa (R. K. Ernst et al., Environ. Microbiol. 5:1341-1349, 2003, and M. C. Wolfgang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:8484-8489, 2003), these findings demonstrate that the R2/F2 pyocin region is a "loaded gun" that can mediate fluoroquinolone susceptibility in P. aeruginosa.

16006335|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that colonizes the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CF lungs often contain a diverse range of P. aeruginosa phenotypes, some of which are likely to contribute to the persistence of infection, yet the causes of diversity are unclear. While the ecological heterogeneity of the lung environment and therapeutic regimes are probable factors, a role for parasitic bacteriophage cannot be ruled out. Parasites have been implicated as a key ecological variable driving the evolution of diversity in host populations. PP7 drove cycles of morphological diversification in host populations of P. aeruginosa due to the de novo evolution of small-rough colony variants that coexisted with large diffuse colony morph bacteria. In the absence of phage, bacteria only displayed the large diffuse colony morphology of the wild-type. Further assays revealed there to be two distinct types of resistant bacteria; these had very different ecological phenotypes, yet each carried a cost of resistance.

The number of bacteria recoverable from the lung increased to approximately 10(6) within 3 days and remained at that number during 35 days of observation. Histologic examination of the infected lungs revealed lesions resembling those seen in lung tissue of humans with acute or chronic nonbacteremic, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, including the presence of goblet-cell hyperplasia, focal areas of necrosis, and acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. This model should be useful for investigating the interactions between microbial virulence factors and host defense mechanisms.

8782753|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation of the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with considerable respiratory morbidity. Although segregation of colonised patients from non-colonised patients to prevent cross-infection has been recommended, there is little evidence that such cross-infection is widespread. We observed that a high proportion of children attending our CF clinic were colonised with P aeruginosa that was resistant to ceftazidime and other beta-lactam antibiotics. We used two genomic fingerprinting techniques to see whether this may have arisen from epidemic spread of a single strain.The prevalence of P aeruginosa colonisation and the antibiotic susceptibility of the organisms was determined from review of laboratory reports in the case-notes of 120 children with CF. Isolates were cultured from the sputum of 65 children colonised with ceftazidime-resistant P aeruginosa. Polymorphisms in total bacterial DNA from 92 isolates were analysed with two molecular fingerprinting techniques--pulsed-field gel electrophoresis after restriction enzyme digestion and assessment of flagellin gene polymorphisms by amplification of the whole gene and restriction enzyme digestion.92 (76.7%) of 120 children were colonised with P aeruginosa, and 65 of the 92 harboured isolates that were resistant to ceftazidime. Only three of the 92 children had never been treated with ceftazidime. The results of the two molecular-fingerprinting techniques were concordant and showed that 55 of 65 children harboured the same epidemic strain. This strain was resistant to ceftazidime, azlocillin, and imipenem, and sensitive to tobramycin and ciprofloxacin.This study provides the first molecular evidence of a long-term outbreak of P aeruginosa in a CF centre. We suggest that careful surveillance of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in CF centres should be instituted with measures to prevent cross-infection. We believe that antipseudomonal monotherapy should be considered with caution.

15231754|a|As genomes evolve, they undergo large-scale evolutionary processes that present a challenge to sequence comparison not posed by short sequences. Recombination causes frequent genome rearrangements, horizontal transfer introduces new sequences into bacterial chromosomes, and deletions remove segments of the genome. Consequently, each genome is a mosaic of unique lineage-specific segments, regions shared with a subset of other genomes and segments conserved among all the genomes under consideration. Furthermore, the linear order of these segments may be shuffled among genomes. We present methods for identification and alignment of conserved genomic DNA in the presence of rearrangements and horizontal transfer. Our methods have been implemented in a software package called Mauve. Mauve has been applied to align nine enterobacterial genomes and to determine global rearrangement structure in three mammalian genomes. We have evaluated the quality of Mauve alignments and drawn comparison to other methods through extensive simulations of genome evolution.

The minitransposons consist of genes specifying resistance to kanamycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin-spectinomycin, and tetracycline as selection markers and a unique NotI cloning site flanked by 19-base-pair terminal repeat sequences of Tn5. Further derivatives also contain lacZ, phoA, luxAB, or xylE genes devoid of their native promoters located next to the terminal repeats in an orientation that affords the generation of gene-operon fusions. The transposons are located on a R6K-based suicide delivery plasmid that provides the IS50R transposase tnp gene in cis but external to the mobile element and whose conjugal transfer to recipients is mediated by RP4 mobilization functions in the donor.

This module was developed in response to the discovery that eukaryotic genome sequencing projects sometimes inadvertently capture the DNA of intracellular bacteria living in the host.The new methods dramatically reduce the rate of false-positive predictions, while maintaining Glimmer's 99% sensitivity rate at detecting genes in most species, and they find substantially more correct start sites, as measured by comparisons to known and well-curated genes. We show that our interpolated Markov model (IMM) DNA discriminator correctly separated 99% of the sequences in a recent genome project that produced a mixture of sequences from the bacterium Prochloron didemni and its sea squirt host, Lissoclinum patella.Glimmer is OSI Certified Open Source and available at http://cbcb.umd.edu/software/glimmer.

15463885|a|Emerging resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa within cystic fibrosis (CF) populations is attributed to antibiotic pressure and spread of transmissible strains. We describe increasing resistance of P. aeruginosa isolates, resulting in the identification of two multiresistant strains and their impact on morbidity.Susceptibility reports of all P. aeruginosa isolates since 1998 in our unit were reviewed. Isolates were submitted for genomic finger-printing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Clinical measures and the consumption of treatment resources were compared between those harbouring resistant organisms and those with sensitive strains.Analysis of 407 reports from 43 patients revealed isolation of multiresistant (MR) organisms increased during 1999. Those harbouring MR strains consumed more resources than non-MR. Strain typing showed a new 'Sheffield' strain in seven patients (100% MR), and the 'Liverpool' strain in 10 patients (40% MR). Individuals in these groups consumed significantly more resources than 23 patients with unique, susceptible strains (4% MR).Increasing resistance in isolates of P. aeruginosa may herald the arrival of a transmissible strain in CF Units which though sometimes sensitive, may become multiply resistant and require more intensive treatment. We now segregate those with transmissible strains from each other and from those with unique strains.

14641578|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from the chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are phenotypically and genotypically diverse. Using strain PAO1 whole genome DNA microarrays, we assessed the genomic variation in P. aeruginosa strains isolated from young children with CF (6 months to 8 years of age) as well as from the environment. Eighty-nine to 97% of the PAO1 open reading frames were detected in 20 strains by microarray analysis, while subsets of 38 gene islands were absent or divergent. No specific pattern of genome mosaicism defined strains associated with CF. Many mosaic regions were distinguished by their low G + C content; their inclusion of phage related or pyocin genes; or by their linkage to a vgr gene or a tRNA gene. Microarray and phenotypic analysis of sequential isolates from individual patients revealed two deletions of greater than 100 kbp formed during evolution in the lung. The gene loss in these sequential isolates raises the possibility that acquisition of pyomelanin production and loss of pyoverdin uptake each may be of adaptive significance. Further characterization of P. aeruginosa diversity within the airways of individual CF patients may reveal common adaptations, perhaps mediated by gene loss, that suggest new opportunities for therapy.

15583313|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative rod that is ubiquitous in nature. P. aeruginosa is also the quintessential opportunistic pathogen, causing a wide variety of infections in compromised hosts. In cystic fibrosis patients, P. aeruginosa is the leading cause of death. In this study, the evolutionary genetic relationships among 17 P. aeruginosa isolates were examined by comparative sequence analysis of the housekeeping gene encoding malate dehydrogenase and the chaperone groEL. The P. aeruginosa isolates examined included the sequenced strain PAO1, 11 strains recovered from cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland, 4 environmental isolates recovered from a hospital environment, and 1 isolate recovered from a plant rhizosphere. Phylogenetically, clinical and environmental isolates clustered together with one another on the mdh gene tree. At the groEL locus, among the 17 isolates examined, only two polymorphic sites were observed, highlighting the close genetic relationship between isolates from these different environments. Phenotypic analysis of 12 traits among our isolates, however, found that only clinical isolates produced phenazines and elastase. Furthermore, molecular analysis of the distribution of 15 regions associated with virulence showed that two of the environmental isolates examined lacked the majority of regions. Among the clinical isolates examined, the 15 virulence regions were variably present. The distribution of two prophages (Bacto1, Pf1) was also determined, with most isolates encoding both these regions. Of the four genomic islands (the flagellum island and PAGI-1, -2, and -3) examined, only two isolates contained the flagellum island, and PAGI-1, -2, and -3 were absent from all isolates tested. Our data demonstrate the significant role horizontal gene transfer and recombination, together with gene loss, play in the evolution of this important human pathogen.

17521417|a|Some isolates of the Liverpool cystic fibrosis epidemic strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibit an unusual virulence-related phenotype, characterized by over-production of quorum sensing-regulated exoproducts such as pyocyanin and LasA protease. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of this unusual phenotype amongst isolates of the epidemic strain, and to study other intraclonal phenotypic and genotypic variations.The unusual phenotype was detected in at least one epidemic strain isolate from the majority of cystic fibrosis patients tested, and can be retained for up to seven years during chronic infection. Multiple sequential isolates of the epidemic strain taken from six patients over a period of up to nine years exhibited a wide range of phenotypes, including different antimicrobial susceptibilities. Our data suggest that each sputum sample contains a mixture of phenotypes and genotypes within the epidemic strain population, including within colony morphotypes. Many isolates exhibit premature (during early rather than late exponential growth) and over-production of pyocyanin, which has a number of toxic effects directly relevant to cystic fibrosis.The widespread occurrence of this unusual phenotype suggests that it may play an important role in the success of the epidemic strain.

16729895|a|Orthologs (genes that have diverged after a speciation event) tend to have similar function, and so their prediction has become an important component of comparative genomics and genome annotation. The gold standard phylogenetic analysis approach of comparing available organismal phylogeny to gene phylogeny is not easily automated for genome-wide analysis; therefore, ortholog prediction for large genome-scale datasets is typically performed using a reciprocal-best-BLAST-hits (RBH) approach. One problem with RBH is that it will incorrectly predict a paralog as an ortholog when incomplete genome sequences or gene loss is involved. In addition, there is an increasing interest in identifying orthologs most likely to have retained similar function.To address these issues, we present here a high-throughput computational method named Ortholuge that further evaluates previously predicted orthologs (including those predicted using an RBH-based approach) - identifying which orthologs most closely reflect species divergence and may more likely have similar function. Ortholuge analyzes phylogenetic distance ratios involving two comparison species and an outgroup species, noting cases where relative gene divergence is atypical. It also identifies some cases of gene duplication after species divergence. Through simulations of incomplete genome data/gene loss, we show that the vast majority of genes falsely predicted as orthologs by an RBH-based method can be identified. Ortholuge was then used to estimate the number of false-positives (predominantly paralogs) in selected RBH-predicted ortholog datasets, identifying approximately 10% paralogs in a eukaryotic data set (mouse-rat comparison) and 5% in a bacterial data set (Pseudomonas putida - Pseudomonas syringae species comparison). Higher quality (more precise) datasets of orthologs, which we term "ssd-orthologs" (supporting-species-divergence-orthologs), were also constructed. These datasets, as well as Ortholuge software that may be used to characterize other species' datasets, are available at http://www.pathogenomics.ca/ortholuge/ (software under GNU General Public License).The Ortholuge method reported here appears to significantly improve the specificity (precision) of high-throughput ortholog prediction for both bacterial and eukaryotic species. This method, and its associated software, will aid those performing various comparative genomics-based analyses, such as the prediction of conserved regulatory elements upstream of orthologous genes.

16939533|a|Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are distinct genetic elements on the chromosomes of a large number of bacterial pathogens. PAIs encode various virulence factors and are normally absent from non-pathogenic strains of the same or closely related species. PAIs are considered to be a subclass of genomic islands that are acquired by horizontal gene transfer via transduction, conjugation and transformation, and provide 'quantum leaps' in microbial evolution. Data based on numerous sequenced bacterial genomes demonstrate that PAIs are present in a wide range of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of humans, animals and plants. Recent research focused on PAIs has not only led to the identification of many novel virulence factors used by these species during infection of their respective hosts, but also dramatically changed our way of thinking about the evolution of bacterial virulence.

15501914|a|PSORTb v.1.1 is the most precise bacterial localization prediction tool available. However, the program's predictive coverage and recall are low and the method is only applicable to Gram-negative bacteria. The goals of the present work are as follows: increase PSORTb's coverage while maintaining the existing precision level, expand it to include Gram-positive bacteria and then carry out a comparative analysis of localization.An expanded database of proteins of known localization and new modules using frequent subsequence-based support vector machines was introduced into PSORTb v.2.0. The program attains a precision of 96% for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and predictive coverage comparable to other tools for whole proteome analysis. We show that the proportion of proteins at each localization is remarkably consistent across species, even in species with varying proteome size.Web-based version: http://www.psort.org/psortb.

17002542|a|A significant increase in sensitivity to several antibiotics was observed in vitro after infection of the two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains O1 and K with the filamentous phage Pf3 and Pf1, respectively. Moreover, upon infection with phage Pf1 a P. aeruginosa K strain harboring a plasmid-borne gentamicin resistance gene could be resensitized to the antibiotic. We further show that BALB/c mice were rescued from lethal infections with P. aeruginosa K by concomitant treatment with phage Pf1 and low concentrations of gentamicin, neither of which was able to cure the infection when administered alone.

11498392|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa continues to be a major cause of infections in Western society, in part because of its high intrinsic resistance to antibiotics. It has been demonstrated that this intrinsic resistance arises from the combination of unusually restricted outer-membrane permeability and secondary resistance mechanisms such as energy-dependent multidrug efflux and chromosomally encoded periplasmic beta-lactamase. Given this high level of natural resistance, mutational resistance to most classes of antibiotics can readily arise. In this review we summarize new insights into the mechanisms of resistance, and describe therapeutic approaches that can be used in the face of this continuing resistance threat, as well as new approaches that are being developed to combat resistance.

6413410|a|Twenty-six Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from patients with cystic fibrosis were typed by the Fisher immunotyping scheme. Only 6 strains were agglutinated by a single typing serum, whereas 15 strains were agglutinated with more than one serum and 5 were not agglutinated by any serum. Neither the polyagglutinable nor the nonagglutinable strains were typable by hemagglutination inhibition or immunodiffusion, suggesting that these polyagglutinable strains did not express multiple serotype antigens, but were instead being agglutinated by antibody to nonserotype determinants. Four typable isolates were resistant to pooled normal human serum, whereas the 12 polyagglutinable and nonagglutinable isolates studied were very sensitive to normal human serum. The outer membranes of 16 strains were isolated and characterized. The data suggested, in general, strong conservation of outer membrane protein patterns. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were purified by a new technique which allowed isolation of both rough and smooth LPS in high yields. Three of four typable, serum-resistant strains examined had amounts of smooth, O-antigen-containing LPS equivalent to our laboratory wild type, P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain H103. In contrast, 10 of 12 polyagglutinable or nonagglutinable, serum-sensitive strains had very little or no smooth, O-antigen-containing LPS, and the other two contained less smooth LPS than our wild-type strain H103. In agreement with this data, five independent, rough, LPS O-antigen-deficient mutants of strain H103 were nontypable and serum sensitive. We suggest that the LPS defects described here represent a significant new property of many P. aeruginosa strains associated with cystic fibrosis.

14983043|a|The ubiquitous bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the quintessential opportunistic pathogen. Certain isolates infect a broad range of host organisms, from plants to humans. The pathogenic promiscuity of particular variants may reflect an increased virulence gene repertoire beyond the core P. aeruginosa genome. We have identified and characterized two P. aeruginosa pathogenicity islands (PAPI-1 and PAPI-2) in the genome of PA14, a highly virulent clinical isolate. The 108-kb PAPI-1 and 11-kb PAPI-2, which are absent from the less virulent reference strain PAO1, exhibit highly modular structures, revealing their complex derivations from a wide array of bacterial species and mobile elements. Most of the genes within these islands that are homologous to known genes occur in other human and plant bacterial pathogens. For example, PAPI-1 carries a complete gene cluster predicted to encode a type IV group B pilus, a well known adhesin absent from strain PAO1. However, >80% of the PAPI-1 DNA sequence is unique, and 75 of its 115 predicted ORF products are unrelated to any known proteins or functional domains. Significantly, many PAPI-1 ORFs also occur in several P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis isolates. Twenty-three PAPI ORFs were mutated, and 19 were found to be necessary for full plant or animal virulence, with 11 required for both. The large set of "extra" virulence functions encoded by both PAPIs may contribute to the increased promiscuity of highly virulent P. aeruginosa strains, by directing additional pathogenic functions.

2010913|a|The genome of the class II filamentous bacteriophage Pf1 has been sequenced by a combination of the chain termination and chemical degradation methods. It consists of 7349 nucleotides in a closed, circular loop of single-stranded DNA. The size and position of its open reading frames (ORFs) in general resemble those of other filamentous bacteriophage genomes. The size and position of the spaces between the ORFs have not been conserved, however, and six short reading frames (2 of which overlap) occupy a region corresponding to that filled by genes 2 and 10 in the Ff genome. Most of the ORFs are preceded by sequences resembling ribosome binding sites from the phage's host. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that appear to differ somewhat from their counterparts in Escherichia coli. A search for sequences related to known pseudomonad promoters suggests that the promoters in this bacteriophage may well be ntr-dependent, with the two strongest preceding the gene for the major coat protein (gene 8) and another ORF (430). Gene 8 is followed by a sequence with the properties of a rho-independent terminator of transcription, like that at the same position in the genome of Ff. The Pf1 genome contains no collection of potential stem-and-loop structures corresponding to those that initiate replication of Ff DNA and assembly of the Ff virion, although isolated structures of this kind are present. The available evidence suggests that at least 13 of the 14 major ORFs are expressed. Overall, the organization of the Pf1 genome differs from that of the other class II filamentous phage whose genome has been sequenced, Pf3, as much as it does from that of the class I phages Ff and IKe.

16299586|a|Microbial genes that are "novel" (no detectable homologs in other species) have become of increasing interest as environmental sampling suggests that there are many more such novel genes in yet-to-be-cultured microorganisms. By analyzing known microbial genomic islands and prophages, we developed criteria for systematic identification of putative genomic islands (clusters of genes of probable horizontal origin in a prokaryotic genome) in 63 prokaryotic genomes, and then characterized the distribution of novel genes and other features. All but a few of the genomes examined contained significantly higher proportions of novel genes in their predicted genomic islands compared with the rest of their genome (Paired t test = 4.43E-14 to 1.27E-18, depending on method). Moreover, the reverse observation (i.e., higher proportions of novel genes outside of islands) never reached statistical significance in any organism examined. We show that this higher proportion of novel genes in predicted genomic islands is not due to less accurate gene prediction in genomic island regions, but likely reflects a genuine increase in novel genes in these regions for both bacteria and archaea. This represents the first comprehensive analysis of novel genes in prokaryotic genomic islands and provides clues regarding the origin of novel genes. Our collective results imply that there are different gene pools associated with recently horizontally transmitted genomic regions versus regions that are primarily vertically inherited. Moreover, there are more novel genes within the gene pool associated with genomic islands. Since genomic islands are frequently associated with a particular microbial adaptation, such as antibiotic resistance, pathogen virulence, or metal resistance, this suggests that microbes may have access to a larger "arsenal" of novel genes for adaptation than previously thought.

14702321|a|The Pseudomonas aeruginosa plasmid pKLC102 coexists as a plasmid and a genome island in clone C strains. Whereas the related plasmid pKLK106 reversibly recombines with P. aeruginosa clone K chromosomes at one of the two tRNA(Lys) genes, pKLC102 is incorporated into the tRNA(Lys) gene only close to the pilA locus. Targeting of the other tRNA(Lys) copy in the chromosome is blocked by a 23,395-bp mosaic of truncated PAO open reading frames, transposons, and pKLC102 homologs. Annotation and phylogenetic analysis of the large 103,532-bp pKLC102 sequence revealed that pKLC102 is a hybrid of plasmid and phage origin. The plasmid lineage conferred oriV and genes for replication, partitioning, and conjugation, including a pil cluster encoding type IV thin sex pili and an 8,524-bp chvB glucan synthetase gene that is known to be a major determinant for host tropism and virulence. The phage lineage conferred integrase, att, and a syntenic set of conserved hypothetical genes also observed in the tRNA(Gly)-associated genome islands of P. aeruginosa clone C chromosomes. In subgroup C isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis, pKLC102 was irreversibly fixed into the chromosome by the insertion of the large 23,061-bp class I transposon TNCP23, which is a composite of plasmid, integron, and IS6100 elements. Intramolecular transposition of a copy of IS6100 led to chromosomal inversions and disruption of plasmid synteny. The case of pKLC102 in P. aeruginosa clone C documents the intraclonal evolution of a genome island from a mobile ancestor via a reversibly integrated state to irreversible incorporation and dissipation in the chromosome.

11029426|a|Temperate bacteriophage D3, a member of the virus family Siphoviridae, is responsible for serotype conversion in its host, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The complete sequence of the double-stranded DNA genome has been determined. The 56,426 bp contains 90 putative open reading frames (ORFs) and four genes specifying tRNAs. The latter are specific for methionine (AUG), glycine (GGA), asparagine (AAC), and threonine (ACA). The tRNAs may function in the translation of certain highly expressed proteins from this relatively AT-rich genome. D3 proteins which exhibited a high degree of sequence similarity to previously characterized phage proteins included the portal, major head, tail, and tail tape measure proteins, endolysin, integrase, helicase, and NinG. The layout of genes was reminiscent of lambdoid phages, with the exception of the placement of the endolysin gene, which parenthetically also lacked a cognate holin. The greatest sequence similarity was found in the morphogenesis genes to coliphages HK022 and HK97. Among the ORFs was discovered the gene encoding the fucosamine O-acetylase, which is in part responsible for the serotype conversion events.

18083816|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic lung infections are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PA14 were compared with the Liverpool epidemic strain LESB58 to assess in vivo growth, infection kinetics, and bacterial persistence and localization within tissues in a rat model of chronic lung infection. The three P. aeruginosa strains demonstrated similar growth curves in vivo but differences in tissue distribution. The LESB58 strain persisted in the bronchial lumen, while the PAO1 and PA14 strains were found localized in the alveolar regions and grew as macrocolonies after day 7 postinfection. Bacterial strains were compared for swimming and twitching motility and for the production of biofilm. The P. aeruginosa LESB58 strain produced more biofilm than PAO1 and PA14. Competitive index (CI) analysis of PAO1, PA14, and LESB58 in vivo indicated CI values of 0.002, 0.0002, and 0.14 between PAO1-PA14, PAO1-LESB58, and LESB58-PA14, respectively. CI analysis comparing the in vivo growth of the PAO1 DeltaPA5441 mutant and four PA14 surface attachment-defective (sad) mutants gave CI values 10 to 1,000 times lower in competitions with their respective wild-type strains PAO1 and PA14. P. aeruginosa strains studied in the rat model of chronic lung infection demonstrated similar in vivo growth but differences in virulence as shown with a competitive in vivo assay. These differences were further confirmed with biofilm and motility in vitro assays, where strain LESB58 produced more biofilm but had less capacity for motility than PAO1 and PA14.

15133094|a|Type IV pili (TFP) are important colonization factors of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, involved in biofilm formation and attachment to host cells. This study undertook a comprehensive analysis of TFP alleles in more than 290 environmental, clinical, rectal and cystic fibrosis (CF) isolates of P. aeruginosa. Based on the results, a new system of nomenclature is proposed, in which P. aeruginosa TFP are divided into five distinct phylogenetic groups. Each pilin allele is stringently associated with characteristic, distinct accessory genes that allow the identification of the allele by specific PCR. The invariant association of the pilin and accessory genes implies horizontal transfer of the entire locus. Analysis of pilin allele distribution among isolates from various sources revealed a striking bias in the prevalence of isolates with group I pilin genes from CF compared with non-CF human sources (P<0.0001), suggesting this particular pilin type, which can be post-translationally modified by glycosylation via the action of TfpO (PilO), may confer a colonization or persistence advantage in the CF host. This allele was also predominant in paediatric CF isolates (29 of 43; 67.4 %), showing that this bias is apparent early in colonization. Group I pilins were also the most common type found in environmental isolates tested. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first example of a P. aeruginosa virulence factor allele that is strongly associated with CF isolates.

18680607|a|Genomic islands (GIs) are clusters of genes in prokaryotic genomes of probable horizontal origin. GIs are disproportionately associated with microbial adaptations of medical or environmental interest. Recently, multiple programs for automated detection of GIs have been developed that utilize sequence composition characteristics, such as G+C ratio and dinucleotide bias. To robustly evaluate the accuracy of such methods, we propose that a dataset of GIs be constructed using criteria that are independent of sequence composition-based analysis approaches.We developed a comparative genomics approach (IslandPick) that identifies both very probable islands and non-island regions. The approach involves 1) flexible, automated selection of comparative genomes for each query genome, using a distance function that picks appropriate genomes for identification of GIs, 2) identification of regions unique to the query genome, compared with the chosen genomes (positive dataset) and 3) identification of regions conserved across all genomes (negative dataset). Using our constructed datasets, we investigated the accuracy of several sequence composition-based GI prediction tools.Our results indicate that AlienHunter has the highest recall, but the lowest measured precision, while SIGI-HMM is the most precise method. SIGI-HMM and IslandPath/DIMOB have comparable overall highest accuracy. Our comparative genomics approach, IslandPick, was the most accurate, compared with a curated list of GIs, indicating that we have constructed suitable datasets. This represents the first evaluation, using diverse and, independent datasets that were not artificially constructed, of the accuracy of several sequence composition-based GI predictors. The caveats associated with this analysis and proposals for optimal island prediction are discussed.

12426355|a|Intraclonal genome diversity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied in one of the most diverse mosaic regions of the P. aeruginosa chromosome. The ca. 110-kb large hypervariable region located near the lipH gene in two members of the predominant P. aeruginosa clone C, strain C and strain SG17M, was sequenced. In both strains the region consists of an individual strain-specific gene island of 111 (strain C) or 106 (SG17M) open reading frames (ORFs) and of a 7-kb stretch of clone C-specific sequence of 9 ORFs. The gene islands are integrated into conserved tRNA(Gly) genes and have a bipartite structure. The first part adjacent to the tRNA gene consists of strain-specific ORFs encoding metabolic functions and transporters, the majority of which have homologs of known function in other eubacteria, such as hemophores, cytochrome c biosynthesis, or mercury resistance. The second part is made up mostly of ORFs of yet-unknown function. Forty-seven of these ORFs are mutual homologs with a pairwise amino acid sequence identity of 35 to 88% and are arranged in the same order in the two gene islands. We hypothesize that this novel type of gene island derives from mobile elements which, upon integration, endow the recipient with strain-specific metabolic properties, thus possibly conferring on it a selective advantage in its specific habitat.

17038190|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium and an important opportunistic human pathogen. Generally, the acquisition of genes in the form of pathogenicity islands distinguishes pathogenic isolates from nonpathogens. We therefore sequenced a highly virulent strain of P. aeruginosa, PA14, and compared it with a previously sequenced (and less pathogenic) strain, PAO1, to identify novel virulence genes.The PA14 and PAO1 genomes are remarkably similar, although PA14 has a slightly larger genome (6.5 megabses [Mb]) than does PAO1 (6.3 Mb). We identified 58 PA14 gene clusters that are absent in PAO1 to determine which of these genes, if any, contribute to its enhanced virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans pathogenicity model. First, we tested 18 additional diverse strains in the C. elegans model and observed a wide range of pathogenic potential; however, genotyping these strains using a custom microarray showed that the presence of PA14 genes that are absent in PAO1 did not correlate with the virulence of these strains. Second, we utilized a full-genome nonredundant mutant library of PA14 to identify five genes (absent in PAO1) required for C. elegans killing. Surprisingly, although these five genes are present in many other P. aeruginosa strains, they do not correlate with virulence in C. elegans.Genes required for pathogenicity in one strain of P. aeruginosa are neither required for nor predictive of virulence in other strains. We therefore propose that virulence in this organism is both multifactorial and combinatorial, the result of a pool of pathogenicity-related genes that interact in various combinations in different genetic backgrounds.

15834046|a|A number of transmissible Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains have been identified which potentially constitute an emerging threat to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We sought to identify DNA markers that were specific to a transmissible P. aeruginosa CF clone and evaluate these probes on a large collection of genotypically distinct P. aeruginosa strains. Using subtractive DNA hybridization, in combination with analysis using the P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome chip, DNA markers specific for or absent from the Manchester transmissible CF strain (MA) were identified. Five subtractive DNA hybridization markers (MA15, MA18, MA21, MA22, and MA30) were found to be specific to strain MA and were located within a novel 13,318-bp genomic island, designated the MA island. The MA island encoded 18 genes and consisted of two bacteriophage-like regions; one region encoded the MA-specific subtractive hybridization markers, while the other bacteriophage-like region contained a Vibrio cholera-like toxin gene. Probes MA15, MA18, MA21, MA22, and MA30 were all found to be specific to strain MA when a collection of 141 P. aeruginosa strains was examined by hybridization with each DNA marker. In contrast, a previously isolated DNA marker for the Liverpool transmissible CF strain, PS21, was not found to be specific, detecting two additional strain types in the collection screened. Both the Manchester and Liverpool strain types were not encountered in CF populations outside the United Kingdom. The MA genomic island and Vibrio cholera-like toxin gene within it constitute novel genetic factors associated with a transmissible P. aeruginosa strain and their role in pathogenesis remains to be determined.

11208781|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium, is capable of colonizing a wide range of environmental niches and can also cause serious infections in humans. In order to understand the genetic makeup of pathogenic P. aeruginosa strains, a method of differential hybridization of arrayed libraries of cloned DNA fragments was developed. An M13 library of DNA from strain X24509, isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection, was screened using a DNA probe from P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. The genome of PAO1 has been recently sequenced and can be used as a reference for comparisons of genetic organization in different strains. M13 clones that did not react with a DNA probe from PAO1 carried X24509-specific inserts. When a similar array hybridization analysis with DNA probes from different strains was used, a set of M13 clones which carried sequences present in the majority of human P. aeruginosa isolates from a wide range of clinical sources was identified. The inserts of these clones were used to identify cosmids encompassing a contiguous 48.9-kb region of the X24509 chromosome called PAGI-1 (for "P. aeruginosa genomic island 1"). PAGI-1 is incorporated in the X24509 chromosome at a locus that shows a deletion of a 6,729-bp region present in strain PAO1. Survey of the incidence of PAGI-1 revealed that this island is present in 85% of the strains from clinical sources. Approximately half of the PAGI-1-carrying strains show the same deletion as X24509, while the remaining strains contain both the PAGI-1 sequences and the 6,729-bp PAO1 segment. Sequence analysis of PAGI-1 revealed that it contains 51 predicted open reading frames. Several of these genes encoded products with predictable function based on their sequence similarities to known genes, including insertion sequences, determinants of regulatory proteins, a number of dehydrogenase gene homologs, and two for proteins of implicated in detoxification of reactive oxygen species. It is very likely that PAGI-1 was acquired by a large number of P. aeruginosa isolates through horizontal gene transfer. The selection for its maintenance may be the consequence of expression of any one of the genes of unknown function or the genes which allow P. aeruginosa to survive under the conditions that generate reactive oxygen species. Alternatively, one or both of the transcriptional regulators encoded in PAGI-1 may control the expression of genes in the P. aeruginosa chromosome, which provides a selective advantage for strains that have acquired this genomic island.

16879637|a|Instability and excision of pathogenicity islands (PAIs) have already been described in Escherichia coli 536. In this edition of Molecular Microbiology, Bianca Hochhut and colleagues from the University of Würzburg in Germany have shown that the instability of four of the E. coli 536 PAIs is mediated by a P4-type integrase encoded within the specific PAI by a site-specific recombination mechanism. The integrase encoded on PAI II(536) is able to mediate excision and integration of both PAI II(536), and also PAI V(536). The att sites of both these PAIs have a region of sequence similarity, which is also found in several other PAIs and in tRNA genes in several bacterial species. The cross-PAI activity of this integrase (Int(PAI II)) suggests that it plays an important role in both genome evolution and horizontal transfer of pathogenicity elements, possibly even across species barriers. Deletion of PAIs that carry genes for adhesins and other traits might lead to a phase variation-like phenomenon. Differential regulation of integrase activity or production might add a further level of fine-tuning during bacterial infection.

18287045|a|One of the hallmarks of the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is its ability to thrive in diverse environments that includes humans with a variety of debilitating diseases or immune deficiencies. Here we report the complete sequence and comparative analysis of the genomes of two representative P. aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients whose genetic disorder predisposes them to infections by this pathogen. The comparison of the genomes of the two CF strains with those of other P. aeruginosa presents a picture of a mosaic genome, consisting of a conserved core component, interrupted in each strain by combinations of specific blocks of genes. These strain-specific segments of the genome are found in limited chromosomal locations, referred to as regions of genomic plasticity. The ability of P. aeruginosa to shape its genomic composition to favor survival in the widest range of environmental reservoirs, with corresponding enhancement of its metabolic capacity is supported by the identification of a genomic island in one of the sequenced CF isolates, encoding enzymes capable of degrading terpenoids produced by trees. This work suggests that niche adaptation is a major evolutionary force influencing the composition of bacterial genomes. Unlike genome reduction seen in host-adapted bacterial pathogens, the genetic capacity of P. aeruginosa is determined by the ability of individual strains to acquire or discard genomic segments, giving rise to strains with customized genomic repertoires. Consequently, this organism can survive in a wide range of environmental reservoirs that can serve as sources of the infecting organisms.

11520530|a|Infection with transmissible strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can occur in uncolonised patients, but cross infection (superinfection) of patients already colonised withP aeruginosa has not been reported. With genotypic identification, we found superinfection by a multiresistant transmissible strain of P aeruginosa in four patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who were already colonised by unique strains of P aeruginosa. No evidence of environmental contamination was found, but all patients became superinfected after contact with colonised individuals during inpatient stays. Inpatients with CF who are colonised with P aeruginosa should be separated by strain type. Such strain typing can only be reliably done by genomic methods, but this has resource implications.

17526836|a|Bacteriophages play an important role in bacterial virulence and phenotypic variation. It has been shown that filamentous bacteriophage Pf4 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 mediates the formation of small-colony variants (SCVs) in biofilms. This morphology type is associated with parameters of poor lung function in cystic fibrosis patients, and SCVs are often more resistant to antibiotics than wild-type cells. P. aeruginosa strain PA14 also contains a Pf1-like filamentous prophage, which is designated Pf5, and is highly homologous to Pf4. Since P. aeruginosa PA14 produces SCVs very efficiently in biofilms grown in static cultures, the role of Pf5 in SCV formation under these conditions was investigated. The presence of the Pf5 replicative form in total DNA from SCVs and wild-type cells was detected, but it was not possible to detect the Pf5 major coat protein by immunoblot analysis in PA14 SCV cultures. This suggests that the Pf5 filamentous phage is not present at high densities in the PA14 SCVs. Consistent with these results, we were unable to detect coaB expression in SCV cultures and SCV colonies. The SCV variants formed under static conditions were not linked to Pf5 phage activity, since Pf5 insertion mutants with decreased or no production of the Pf5 RF produced SCVs as efficiently as the wild-type strain. Finally, analysis of 48 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates showed no association between the presence of Pf1-like filamentous phages and the ability to form SCVs under static conditions; this suggests that filamentous phages are generally not involved in the emergence of P. aeruginosa SCVs.

11069649|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces three types of bacteriocins: R-, F- and S-type pyocins. The S-type pyocin is a colicin-like protein, whereas the R-type pyocin resembles a contractile but non-flexible tail structure of bacteriophage, and the F-type a flexible but non-contractile one. As genetically related phages exist for each type, these pyocins have been thought to be variations of defective phage. In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of R2 pyocin genes, along with those for F2 pyocin, which are located downstream of the R2 gene cluster on the chromosome of P. aeruginosa PAO1, was analysed in order to elucidate the relationship between the pyocins and bacteriophages. The results clearly demonstrated that the R-type pyocin is derived from a common ancestral origin with P2 phage and the F-type from lambda phage. This notion was supported by identification of a lysis gene cassette similar to those for bacteriophages. The gene organization of the R2 and F2 pyocin gene cluster, however, suggested that both pyocins are not simple defective phages, but are phage tails that have been evolutionarily specialized as bacteriocins. A systematic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of P. aeruginosa strains that produce various subtypes of R and F pyocins revealed that the genes for every subtype are located between trpE and trpG in the same or very similar gene organization as for R2 and F2 pyocins, but with alterations in genes that determine the receptor specificity.

10094695|a|Ten genes (plt) required for the biosynthesis of pyoluteorin, an antifungal compound composed of a bichlorinated pyrrole linked to a resorcinol moiety, were identified within a 24-kb genomic region of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5. The deduced amino acid sequences of eight plt genes were similar to the amino acid sequences of genes with known biosynthetic functions, including type I polyketide synthases (pltB, pltC), an acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) dehydrogenase (pltE), an acyl-CoA synthetase (pltF), a thioesterase (pltG), and three halogenases (pltA, pltD, and pltM). Insertions of the transposon Tn5 or Tn3-nice or a kanamycin resistance gene in each of these genes abolished pyoluteorin production by Pf-5. The presumed functions of the eight plt products are consistent with biochemical transformations involved in pyoluteorin biosynthesis from proline and acetate precursors. Isotope labeling studies demonstrated that proline is the primary precursor to the dichloropyrrole moiety of pyoluteorin. The deduced amino acid sequence of the product of another plt gene, pltR, is similar to those of members of the LysR family of transcriptional activators. pltR and pltM are transcribed divergently from the pltLABCDEFG gene cluster, and a sequence with the characteristics of a LysR binding site was identified within the 486-bp intergenic region separating pltRM from pltLABCDEFG. Transcription of the pyoluteorin biosynthesis genes pltB, pltE, and pltF, assessed with transcriptional fusions to an ice nucleation reporter gene, was significantly greater in Pf-5 than in a pltR mutant of Pf-5. Therefore, PltR is proposed to be a transcriptional activator of linked pyoluteorin biosynthesis genes.

15293611|a|Despite recent reports of clonal strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) units, the need for routine microbiological surveillance remains contentious. Sputum was collected prospectively from productive patients attending the regional paediatric and adult CF units in Brisbane, Australia. All P. aeruginosa isolates were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Spirometry, anthropometrics, hospitalisations and antibiotic sensitivity data were recorded. The first 100 sputum samples (first 50 patients at each clinic) harboured 163 isolates of P. aeruginosa. A total of 39 patients shared a common strain (pulsotype 2), 20 patients shared a strain with at least one other patient and 41 patients harboured unique strains. Eight patients shared a strain identical to a previously reported Australian transmissible strain (pulsotype 1). Compared with the unique strain group, patients harbouring pulsotype 2 were younger and had poorer lung function. Treatment requirements were similar in these two groups, as were the rates of multiresistance. In conclusion, 59% of patients harboured a clonal strain, supporting the need for routine microbiological surveillance. In contrast to previously described clonal strains, the dominant pulsotype was indistinguishable from nonclonal strains with respect to both colonial morphology and multiresistance. The clinical significance of clonal strains remains uncertain and requires longitudinal study.

15620443|a|We conducted an environmental survey in the Liverpool adult cystic fibrosis (CF) centre in order to determine the extent of environmental contamination with an epidemic strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that colonizes most CF patients in Liverpool, and to identify possible reservoirs and routes of cross-infection. In addition, we studied the survival of this strain on dry surfaces, compared with that of other CF P. aeruginosa strains, to explore factors that might contribute to its high transmissibility. Samples were collected from staff, patients and the environment (drains, bath tubs, showers, dry surfaces, respiratory equipment and air) in the inpatient ward and outpatient clinic. P. aeruginosa strains were tested using a new polymerase chain reaction amplification assay specific for the Liverpool epidemic strain (LES). LES was isolated from patients' hands, clothes and bed linen. Environmental contamination with LES was only detected in close proximity to colonized patients (external surfaces of their respiratory equipment, and spirometry machine tubing and chair) and was short-lived. No persistent environmental reservoirs were found. LES was detected in the majority of air samples from inside patients' rooms, the ward corridor and the outpatient clinic. Survival of LES on dry surfaces was significantly longer than that for some other strains tested, but not compared with other strains shown not to be transmissible. Improved environmental survival on its own, therefore, cannot explain the high transmissibility of this epidemic strain. Our study suggests that airborne dissemination plays a significant role in patient-to-patient spread of LES, and confirms the need to segregate those patients colonized by epidemic P. aeruginosa strains from all other CF patients.

12454160|a|A multiresistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is widespread among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients attending clinics in Liverpool, United Kingdom. Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to identify sequences present in the Liverpool CF epidemic strain but absent from strain PAO1. Using dot blot and PCR amplification assays, the prevalence of such sequences among a panel of CF isolates was determined. Several sequences were found only in the Liverpool epidemic strain. Some sequences were present in the Liverpool epidemic strain and in a minority of other isolates, including sequences with homology to genes implicated in O6 serotype and siderophore production. The Liverpool epidemic strain and 81% of nonepidemic isolates contained a sequence identified as part of the PAGI-1 genomic island. Other strains implicated in epidemic spread, which were from Manchester, United Kingdom, and Melbourne, Australia, were also screened. None of the sequences identified was present in the Manchester strain. However, one of two Melbourne strains contained some of the sequences found in the Liverpool epidemic strain. All isolates implicated in epidemic spread and 76% of sporadic isolates contained the exoS gene. A sequence present in all isolates of the Liverpool epidemic strain was used to develop a diagnostic PCR test for identification of the strain from colonies or directly from sputum samples.

2893774|a|Five isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD10) from a patient with cystic fibrosis were examined with regard to several genotypic and phenotypic characteristics to determine whether the patient was colonized with one or several distinct strains. Isolates CD2, CD3, and CD4 were obtained from a single sputum sample, and CD5 and CD10 were obtained 1 and 2 years later, respectively. On the basis of colonial morphology, serotyping, and antibiograms, the five isolates appeared to be different strains. However, Southern blot analysis with a 1.2-kilobase DNA probe containing the P. aeruginosa PAK pilin gene indicated that all five strains were identical at that genetic locus. The pilin genes of the five isolates were cloned and sequenced at the nucleotide level and found to be identical. Southern blot analysis with a probe from a separate region of the P. aeruginosa chromosome, a 741-base-pair PstI-NruI DNA fragment adjacent to the exotoxin A gene, also revealed genetic identity among these five clinical isolates. On this basis, it was concluded that this patient was colonized with a single strain of P. aeruginosa and that the strain had remained genetically stable over a period of 2 years. The predicted pilin sequence of the CD isolates was almost identical to that of strain PA103 (97% homology) and serologically related to PAO pilin, with which it shared 80% homology. No immunological cross-reactivity was detected between the CD and PAK pilins, which shared the least homology (62%) among the four pilins considered in this study. Although all five CD isolates contained identical pilin genes, three had acquired mutations which prevented normal expression of the pilus system. CD3 was a putative regulatory mutant which was unable to produce normal amounts of pilin, and CD4 and CD10 were putative assembly mutants which produced normal amounts of pilin but were unable to assemble the pilin subunit into intact pili.

12534471|a|Bacteria can have population structures ranging from the fully sexual to the highly clonal. Despite numerous studies, the population structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is still somewhat contentious. We used a polyphasic approach in order to shed new light on this issue. A data set consisting of three outer membrane (lipo)protein gene sequences (oprI, oprL and oprD), a DNA-based fingerprint (amplified fragment length polymorphism), serotype and pyoverdine type of 73 P. aeruginosa clinical and environmental isolates, collected across the world, was analysed using biological data analysis software. We observed a clear mosaicism in the results, non-congruence between results of different typing methods and a microscale mosaic structure in the oprD gene. Hence, in this network, we also observed some clonal complexes characterized by an almost identical data set. The most recent clones exhibited serotypes O1, 6, 11 and 12. No obvious correlation was observed between these dominant clones and habitat or, with the exception of some recent clones, geographical origin. Our results are consistent with, and even clarify, some seemingly contradictory results in earlier epidemiological studies. Therefore, we suggest an epidemic population structure for P. aeruginosa, comparable with that of Neisseria meningitidis, a superficially clonal structure with frequent recombinations, in which occasionally highly successful epidemic clones arise.

18203836|a|Patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) commonly harbor the important pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in their airways. During chronic late-stage CF, P. aeruginosa is known to grow under reduced oxygen tension and is even capable of respiring anaerobically within the thickened airway mucus, at a pH of approximately 6.5. Therefore, proteins involved in anaerobic metabolism represent potentially important targets for therapeutic intervention. In this study, the clinically relevant "anaerobiome" or "proteogenome" of P. aeruginosa was assessed. First, two different proteomic approaches were used to identify proteins differentially expressed under anaerobic versus aerobic conditions. Microarray studies were also performed, and in general, the anaerobic transcriptome was in agreement with the proteomic results. However, we found that a major portion of the most upregulated genes in the presence of NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) are those encoding Pf1 bacteriophage. With anaerobic NO(2)(-), the most downregulated genes are those involved postglycolytically and include many tricarboxylic acid cycle genes and those involved in the electron transport chain, especially those encoding the NADH dehydrogenase I complex. Finally, a signature-tagged mutagenesis library of P. aeruginosa was constructed to further screen genes required for both NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) respiration. In addition to genes anticipated to play important roles in the anaerobiome (anr, dnr, nar, nir, and nuo), the cysG and dksA genes were found to be required for both anaerobic NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) respiration. This study represents a major step in unraveling the molecular machinery involved in anaerobic NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) respiration and offers clues as to how we might disrupt such pathways in P. aeruginosa to limit the growth of this important CF pathogen when it is either limited or completely restricted in its oxygen supply.

17179047|a|The large Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity island PAPI-1 of strain PA14 is a cluster of 108 genes that encode a number of virulence features. We demonstrate that, in a subpopulation of cells, PAPI-1 can exist in an extrachromosomal circular form after precise excision from its integration site within the 3' terminus of the tRNA(Lys) gene. Circular PAPI-1 can reintegrate into either of the two tRNA(Lys) genes, including the one that was used for integration of small pathogenicity island PAPI-2 in strain PA14. The excision requires PAPI-1-encoded integrase, a member of the tyrosine recombinase family. PAPI-1 Soj contains the conserved domains of proteins that are related to chromosome and plasmid partition. soj plays a role in maintaining PAPI-1 and mutations in soj result in the loss of PAPI-1 from P. aeruginosa. We further demonstrate that, during coculture, the PAPI-1-containing strains are able to transfer it into P. aeruginosa recipient strains that do not harbor this island naturally. After transfer, PAPI-1 integrates into either of the two tRNA(Lys) genes. PAPI-1 encompasses many features of mobile elements, including mobilization and maintenance modules. Together with the virulence determinants, PAPI-1 plays an important role in the evolution of P. aeruginosa, by expanding its natural habitat from soil and water to animal and human infections.

12057956|a|The outer carbohydrate layer, or O antigen, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa varies markedly in different isolates of these bacteria, and at least 20 distinct O-antigen serotypes have been described. Previous studies have indicated that the major enzymes responsible for O-antigen synthesis are encoded in a cluster of genes that occupy a common genetic locus. We used targeted yeast recombinational cloning to isolate this locus from the 20 internationally recognized serotype strains. DNA sequencing of these isolated segments revealed that at least 11 highly divergent gene clusters occupy this region. Homology searches of the encoded protein products indicated that these gene clusters are likely to direct O-antigen biosynthesis. The O15 serotype strains lack functional gene clusters in the region analyzed, suggesting that O-antigen biosynthesis genes for this serotype are harbored in a different portion of the genome. The overall pattern underscores the plasticity of the P. aeruginosa genome, in which a specific site in a well-conserved genomic region can be occupied by any of numerous islands of functionally related DNA with diverse sequences.

9781879|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of producing various cell-surface polysaccharides including alginate, A-band and B-band lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The D-mannuronic acid residues of alginate and the D-rhamnose (D-Rha) residues of A-band polysaccharide are both derived from the common sugar nucleotide precursor GDP-D-mannose (D-Man). Three genes, rmd, gmd and wbpW, which encode proteins involved in the synthesis of GDP-D-Rha, have been localized to the 5' end of the A-band gene cluster. In this study, WbpW was found to be homologous to phosphomannose isomerases (PMIs) and GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylases (GMPs) involved in GDP-D-Man biosynthesis. To confirm the enzymatic activity of WbpW, Escherichia coli PMI and GMP mutants deficient in the K30 capsule were complemented with wbpW, and restoration of K30 capsule production was observed. This indicates that WbpW, like AlgA, is a bifunctional enzyme that possesses both PMI and GMP activities for the synthesis of GDP-D-Man. No gene encoding a phosphomannose mutase (PMM) enzyme could be identified within the A-band gene cluster. This suggests that the PMM activity of AlgC may be essential for synthesis of the precursor pool of GDP-D-Man, which is converted to GDP-D-Rha for A-band synthesis. Gmd, a previously reported A-band enzyme, and Rmd are predicted to perform the two-step conversion of GDP-D-Man to GDP-D-Rha. Chromosomal mutants were generated in both rmd and wbpW. The Rmd mutants do not produce A-band LPS, while the WbpW mutants synthesize very low amounts of A band after 18 h of growth. The latter observation was thought to result from the presence of the functional homologue AlgA, which may compensate for the WbpW deficiency in these mutants. Thus, WbpW AlgA double mutants were constructed. These mutants also produced low levels of A-band LPS. A search of the PAO1 genome sequence identified a second AlgA homologue, designated ORF488, which may be responsible for the synthesis of GDP-D-Man in the absence of WbpW and AlgA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequence analysis of this region reveals three open reading frames (ORFs), orf477, orf488 and orf303, arranged as an operon. ORF477 is homologous to initiating enzymes that transfer glucose 1-phosphate onto undecaprenol phosphate (Und-P), while ORF303 is homologous to L-rhamnosyltransferases involved in polysaccharide assembly. Chromosomal mapping using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Southern hybridization places orf477, orf488 and orf303 between 0.3 and 0.9 min on the 75 min map of PAO1, giving it a map location distinct from that of previously described polysaccharide genes. This region may represent a unique locus within P. aeruginosa responsible for the synthesis of another polysaccharide molecule.

15995206|a|The Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a transmissible aggressive pathogen of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We compared transcriptome profiles of two LES isolates with each other and with a laboratory and genetic reference strain (PAO1) after growth to late exponential phase and following exposure to oxidative stress. Both LES isolates exhibited enhanced antimicrobial resistances linked to specific mutations in efflux pump genes. Although transcription of AmpC beta-lactamase was up-regulated in both, one LES isolate contained a specific mutation rendering the ampC gene untranslatable. The virulence-related quorum-sensing (QS) regulon of LES431, an isolate that caused pneumonia in the non-CF parent of a CF patient, was considerably up-regulated in comparison to either isolate LES400, associated with a chronic CF infection, or strain PAO1. Premature activation of QS genes was detected in isolates from both non-CF parents and the CF patient in a previously reported infection episode. LES isolates lacking the up-regulated QS phenotype contained different frameshift mutations in lasR. When fed to Drosophila melanogaster, isolate LES431 killed the fruit flies more readily than either isolate LES400 or strain PAO1, indicating that virulence varies intraclonally. The LES may represent a clone with enhanced virulence and antimicrobial resistance characteristics that can vary or are lost due to mutations during long-term colonization but have contributed to the successful spread of the lineage throughout the CF population of the United Kingdom.

PCR-based STM applied to Pseudomonas aeruginosa permitted the identification of genes essential or in vivo maintenance by transposon insertion and negative selection in a mixed population of bacterial mutants. The innovative adaptations and refinement of the technology presented here with P. aeruginosa STM mutants selected in the rat lung have given critical information about genes essential for causing a chronic infection and a wealth of information about biological processes in vivo. The additional use of competitive index analysis for measurement of the level of virulence in vivo, microarray-based screening of selected prioritized STM mutants coupled to metabolomics analysis can now be attempted systematically on a genomic scale. PCR-based STM and combined whole-genome methods can also be applied to any organism having selectable phenotypes for screening.

15489443|a|The processes associated with early events in biofilm formation have become a major research focus over the past several years. Events associated with dispersion of cells from late stage biofilms have, however, received little attention. We demonstrate here that dispersal of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 from biofilms is inducible by a sudden increase in carbon substrate availability. Most efficient at inducing dispersal were sudden increases in availability of succinate > glutamate > glucose that led to approximately 80% reductions in surface-associated biofilm biomass. Nutrient-induced biofilm dispersion was associated with increased expression of flagella (fliC) and correspondingly decreased expression of pilus (pilA) genes in dispersed cells. Changes in gene expression associated with dispersion of P. aeruginosa biofilms were studied by using DNA microarray technology. Results corroborated proteomic data that showed gene expression to be markedly different between biofilms and newly dispersed cells. Gene families that were upregulated in dispersed cells included those for flagellar and ribosomal proteins, kinases, and phage PF1. Within the biofilm, genes encoding a number of denitrification pathways and pilus biosynthesis were also upregulated. Interestingly, nutrient-induced dispersion was associated with an increase in the number of Ser/Thr-phosphorylated proteins within the newly dispersed cells, and inhibition of dephosphorylation reduced the extent of nutrient-induced dispersion. This study is the first to demonstrate that dispersal of P. aeruginosa from biofilms can be induced by the addition of simple carbon sources. This study is also the first to demonstrate that dispersal of P. aeruginosa correlates with a specific dispersal phenotype.

15184530|a|Most past studies of cross-infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in the UK suggest that it is a rare occurrence. However, two recent reports of highly transmissible strains in patients in regional centres in England (Liverpool and Manchester) have raised questions as to the extent of the problem and prompted a nationwide survey to establish the distribution of P. aeruginosa strain genotypes among these patients. Isolates of P. aeruginosa were requested from over 120 hospitals in England and Wales and a sample size of approximately 20% of the CF patient population in each centre was recommended. In total, 1225 isolates were received from 31 centres (range 1 to 330). Single patient isolates were typed by SpeI macrorestriction and PFGE. A panel of strains of the common genotypes including representatives of reported transmissible strains was assembled and further characterized by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) genotyping. At least 72% of all patients harboured strains with unique genotypes. Small clusters of related strains were evident in some centres, presumably indicating limited transmission of local strains. The most prevalent strain was indistinguishable from that previously described as the 'Liverpool' genotype, and accounted for approximately 11% of patient isolates from 15 centres in England and Wales. The second most common genotype (termed Midlands 1) was recovered from 86 patients in nine centres and the third genotype, which matched closely the PFGE profile of Clone C, a genotype originally described in Germany, was found in eight centres and was isolated from 15 patients. A fourth genotype, identical to the published Manchester strain, was found in three centres. FAFLP analysis revealed some microheterogeneity among strains of the Liverpool genotype but all isolates of this genotype were positive by PCR for a strain-specific marker. These data suggest that cross-infection with P. aeruginosa has occurred both within and widely between CF centres in England and Wales. The two most common genotypes accounted for more than one-fifth of patients' isolates examined and transmissible genotypes were found in all but three centres studied. These results emphasize the need for continued surveillance of P. aeruginosa genotypes in CF patients to provide informed infection control policy in treatment centres.

16926421|a|The distributed genome hypothesis (DGH) states that each strain within a bacterial species receives a unique distribution of genes from a population-based supragenome that is many times larger than the genome of any given strain. The observations that natural infecting populations are often polyclonal and that most chronic bacterial pathogens have highly developed mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer suggested the DGH and provided the means and the mechanisms to explain how chronic infections persist in the face of a mammalian host's adaptive defense mechanisms. Having previously established the validity of the DGH for obligate pathogens, we wished to evaluate its applicability to an opportunistic bacterial pathogen. This was accomplished by construction and analysis of a highly redundant pooled genomic library containing approximately 216,000 functional clones that was constructed from 12 low-passage clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 otorrheic isolates and 6 from other body sites. Sequence analysis of 3,214 randomly picked clones (mean insert size, approximately 1.4 kb) from this library demonstrated that 348 (10.8%) of the clones were unique with respect to all genomic sequences of the P. aeruginosa prototype strain, PAO1. Hypothetical translations of the open reading frames within these unique sequences demonstrated protein homologies to a number of bacterial virulence factors and other proteins not previously identified in P. aeruginosa. PCR and reverse transcription-PCR-based assays were performed to analyze the distribution and expression patterns of a 70-open reading frame subset of these sequences among 11 of the clinical strains. These sequences were unevenly distributed among the clinical isolates, with nearly half (34/70) of the novel sequences being present in only one or two of the individual strains. Expression profiling revealed that a vast majority of these sequences are expressed, strongly suggesting they encode functional proteins.

16849729|a|In a previous study of isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in England and Wales, the Midlands 1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified as the second most common clone, representing 10% of isolates and found in nearly one-third of all CF centres [Scott, F. W. & Pitt, T. L. (2004). J Med Microbiol 53, 609-615]. Using suppression subtractive hybridization, 54 sequences were identified as present in a Midlands 1 strain but were absent from strain PAO1. The distribution of 14 of these sequences amongst representatives of Midlands 1, other CF epidemic strains and unrelated P. aeruginosa CF isolates was determined using PCR assays. Using these data, a PCR-based test was developed that was specific for the Midlands 1 clone, which was confirmed using dot-blot hybridization. By applying the test to CF isolates from a CF centre in Liverpool, a Midlands 1 clone was identified. The identity was confirmed using typing by PFGE. The PCR test should facilitate a greater understanding of the distribution of the Midlands 1 strain in the UK and elsewhere.

16687584|a|The Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been highly successful at colonizing cystic fibrosis (CF) patients throughout the UK, has replaced previously established strains in CF patients, has caused infections of non-CF parents of CF patients, and can cause greater morbidity in CF than other strains of P. aeruginosa. Using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) to identify strain-specific sequences, a diagnostic test for the LES based on PCR amplification of SSH sequence PS21 had previously been developed. In this study, the SSH sequence database of LES was substantially increased, using both extension of previous sequences and new rounds of subtraction. Of 92 SSH sequences identified as present in the LES but absent from strain PAO1, 25 were assessed for prevalence amongst a strain panel consisting mainly of LES and non-LES CF isolates. Preliminary analysis of genome sequence data indicated that all SSH sequences that were LES specific or found only rarely in other strains of P. aeruginosa were present on one of three contigs. All of the SSH sequences screened were either unstable amongst LES isolates or were not completely LES specific. Rare false positives were found with the PS21 test. The authors suggest that a second PCR assay designed to detect SSH sequence LESF9 can be used to confirm the identity of the most prevalent CF epidemic lineage in the UK.

15743962|a|Pyoverdine is the primary siderophore of the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The pyoverdine region was recently identified as the most divergent locus alignable between strains in the P. aeruginosa genome. Here we report the nucleotide sequence and analysis of more than 50 kb in the pyoverdine region from nine strains of P. aeruginosa. There are three divergent sequence types in the pyoverdine region, which correspond to the three structural types of pyoverdine. The pyoverdine outer membrane receptor fpvA may be driving diversity at the locus: it is the most divergent alignable gene in the region, is the only gene that showed substantial intratype variation that did not appear to be generated by recombination, and shows evidence of positive selection. The hypothetical membrane protein PA2403 also shows evidence of positive selection; residues on one side of the membrane after protein folding are under positive selection. R', previously identified as a type IV strain, is clearly derived from a type III strain via a 3.4-kb deletion which removes one amino acid from the pyoverdine side chain peptide. This deletion represents a natural modification of the product of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase enzyme, whose consequences are predictive from the DNA sequence. There is also linkage disequilibrium between the pyoverdine region and pvdY, a pyoverdine gene separated by 30 kb from the pyoverdine region. The pyoverdine region shows evidence of horizontal transfer; we propose that some alleles in the region were introduced from other soil bacteria and have been subsequently maintained by diversifying selection.

12562802|a|Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was used to study the sequence variation of three Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, two from clonal infections of cystic fibrosis patients and one from an aquatic environment, relative to the genomic sequence of reference strain PAO1. The majority of the PAO1 genome is represented in these strains; however, at least three prominent islands of PAO1-specific sequence are apparent. Conversely, approximately 10% of the sequencing reads derived from each isolate fail to align with the PAO1 backbone. While average sequence variation among all strains is roughly 0.5%, regions of pronounced differences were evident in whole-genome scans of nucleotide diversity. We analyzed two such divergent loci, the pyoverdine and O-antigen biosynthesis regions, by complete resequencing. A thorough analysis of isolates collected over time from one of the cystic fibrosis patients revealed independent mutations resulting in the loss of O-antigen synthesis alternating with a mucoid phenotype. Overall, we conclude that most of the PAO1 genome represents a core P. aeruginosa backbone sequence while the strains addressed in this study possess additional genetic material that accounts for at least 10% of their genomes. Approximately half of these additional sequences are novel.

A major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. Here we report the complete sequence of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. At 6.3 million base pairs, this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced, and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of P. aeruginosa. Consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability, P. aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism, transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems. We propose that the size and complexity of the P. aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances.

Unfortunately, the sequence of a single genome does not reflect how genetic variability drives pathogenesis within a bacterial species and also limits genome-wide screens for vaccine candidates or for antimicrobial targets. We have generated the genomic sequence of six strains representing the five major disease-causing serotypes of Streptococcus agalactiae, the main cause of neonatal infection in humans. Analysis of these genomes and those available in databases showed that the S. agalactiae species can be described by a pan-genome consisting of a core genome shared by all isolates, accounting for approximately 80% of any single genome, plus a dispensable genome consisting of partially shared and strain-specific genes. Mathematical extrapolation of the data suggests that the gene reservoir available for inclusion in the S. agalactiae pan-genome is vast and that unique genes will continue to be identified even after sequencing hundreds of genomes.

16837528|a|There is a growing literature on the detection of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) events by means of parametric, non-comparative methods. Such approaches rely only on sequence information and utilize different low and high order indices to capture compositional deviation from the genome backbone; the superiority of the latter over the former has been shown elsewhere. However even high order k-mers may be poor estimators of HGT, when insufficient information is available, e.g. in short sliding windows. Most of the current HGT prediction methods require pre-existing annotation, which may restrict their application on newly sequenced genomes.We introduce a novel computational method, Interpolated Variable Order Motifs (IVOMs), which exploits compositional biases using variable order motif distributions and captures more reliably the local composition of a sequence compared with fixed-order methods. For optimal localization of the boundaries of each predicted region, a second order, two-state hidden Markov model (HMM) is implemented in a change-point detection framework. We applied the IVOM approach to the genome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi CT18, a well-studied prokaryote in terms of HGT events, and we show that the IVOMs outperform state-of-the-art low and high order motif methods predicting not only the already characterized Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPI-1 to SPI-10) but also three novel SPIs (SPI-15, SPI-16, SPI-17) and other HGT events.The software is available under a GPL license as a standalone application at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/alien_huntergsv@sanger.ac.ukSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

14702309|a|Bacteriophage D3112 represents one of two distinct groups of transposable phage found in the clinically relevant, opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To further our understanding of transposable phage in P. aeruginosa, we have sequenced the complete genome of D3112. The genome is 37,611 bp, with an overall G+C content of 65%. We have identified 53 potential open reading frames, including three genes (the c repressor gene and early genes A and B) that have been previously characterized and sequenced. The organization of the putative coding regions corresponds to published genetic and transcriptional maps and is very similar to that of enterobacteriophage Mu. In contrast, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has classified D3112 as a lambda-like phage on the basis of its morphology. Similarity-based analyses identified 27 open reading frames with significant matches to proteins in the NCBI databases. Forty-eight percent of these were similar to Mu-like phage and prophage sequences, including proteins responsible for transposition, transcriptional regulation, virion morphogenesis, and capsid formation. The tail proteins were highly similar to prophage sequences in Escherichia coli and phage Phi12 from Staphylococcus aureus, while proteins at the right end were highly similar to proteins in Xylella fastidiosa. We performed phylogenetic analyses to understand the evolutionary relationships of D3112 with respect to Mu-like versus lambda-like bacteriophages. Different results were obtained from similarity-based versus phylogenetic analyses in some instances. Overall, our findings reveal a highly mosaic structure and suggest that extensive horizontal exchange of genetic material played an important role in the evolution of D3112.

12867469|a|Bacteria growing in biofilms often develop multicellular, three-dimensional structures known as microcolonies. Complex differentiation within biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs, leading to the creation of voids inside microcolonies and to the dispersal of cells from within these voids. However, key developmental processes regulating these events are poorly understood. A normal component of multicellular development is cell death. Here we report that a repeatable pattern of cell death and lysis occurs in biofilms of P. aeruginosa during the normal course of development. Cell death occurred with temporal and spatial organization within biofilms, inside microcolonies, when the biofilms were allowed to develop in continuous-culture flow cells. A subpopulation of viable cells was always observed in these regions. During the onset of biofilm killing and during biofilm development thereafter, a bacteriophage capable of superinfecting and lysing the P. aeruginosa parent strain was detected in the fluid effluent from the biofilm. The bacteriophage implicated in biofilm killing was closely related to the filamentous phage Pf1 and existed as a prophage within the genome of P. aeruginosa. We propose that prophage-mediated cell death is an important mechanism of differentiation inside microcolonies that facilitates dispersal of a subpopulation of surviving cells.

15547279|a|A current question in biofilm research is whether biofilm-specific genetic processes can lead to differentiation in physiology and function among biofilm cells. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, phenotypic variants which exhibit a small-colony phenotype on agar media and a markedly accelerated pattern of biofilm development compared to that of the parental strain are often isolated from biofilms. We grew P. aeruginosa biofilms in glass flow cell reactors and observed that the emergence of small-colony variants (SCVs) in the effluent runoff from the biofilms correlated with the emergence of plaque-forming Pf1-like filamentous phage (designated Pf4) from the biofilm. Because several recent studies have shown that bacteriophage genes are among the most highly upregulated groups of genes during biofilm development, we investigated whether Pf4 plays a role in SCV formation during P. aeruginosa biofilm development. We carried out immunoelectron microscopy using anti-Pf4 antibodies and observed that SCV cells, but not parental-type cells, exhibited high densities of Pf4 filaments on the cell surface and that these filaments were often tightly interwoven into complex latticeworks surrounding the cells. Moreover, infection of P. aeruginosa planktonic cultures with Pf4 caused the emergence of SCVs within the culture. These SCVs exhibited enhanced attachment, accelerated biofilm development, and large regions of dead and lysed cells inside microcolonies in a manner identical to that of SCVs obtained from biofilms. We concluded that Pf4 can mediate phenotypic variation in P. aeruginosa biofilms. We also performed partial sequencing and analysis of the Pf4 replicative form and identified a number of open reading frames not previously recognized in the genome of P. aeruginosa, including a putative postsegregational killing operon.

17468398|a|The metabolically versatile Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhabits terrestrial, aquatic, animal-, human-, and plant-host-associated environments and is an important causative agent of nosocomial infections, particularly in intensive-care units. The population genetics of P. aeruginosa was investigated by an approach that is generally applicable to the rapid, robust, and informative genotyping of bacteria. DNA, amplified from the bacterial colony by circles of multiplex primer extension, is hybridized onto a microarray to yield an electronically portable binary multimarker genotype that represents the core genome by single nucleotide polymorphisms and the accessory genome by markers of genomic islets and islands. The 240 typed P. aeruginosa strains of diverse habitats and geographic origin segregated into two large nonoverlapping clusters and 45 isolated clonal complexes with few or no partners. The majority of strains belonged to few dominant clones widespread in disease and environmental habitats. The most frequent genotype was represented by the sequenced strain PA14. Core and accessory genome were found to be nonrandomly assembled in P. aeruginosa. Individual clones preferred a specific repertoire of accessory segments. Even the most promiscuous genomic island, pKLC102, had integrated preferentially into a subset of clones. Moreover, some physically distant loci of the core genome, including oriC, showed nonrandom associations of genotypes, whereas other segments in between were freely recombining. Thus, the P. aeruginosa genome is made up of clone-typical segments in core and accessory genome and of blocks in the core with unrestricted gene flow in the population.

Researchers submit proposed annotation updates through one of three web-based form options which are then subjected to review, and if accepted, entered into both the database and log file of updates with author acknowledgement. In addition, a coordinator continually reviews literature for suitable updates, as we have found such reviews to be the most efficient. Both the annotations database and updates-log database have Boolean search capability with the ability to sort results and download all data or search results as tab-delimited files. To complement this peer-reviewed genome annotation, we also provide a linked GBrowse view which displays alternate annotations. Additional tools and analyses are also integrated, including PseudoCyc, and knockout mutant information. We propose that this database system, with its focus on facilitating flexible queries of the data and providing access to both peer-reviewed annotations as well as alternate annotation information, may be a suitable model for other genome projects wishing to use a continually updated, community-based annotation approach.

12815109|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium capable of causing a variety of life-threatening human infections. The genetic basis for preferential infection of certain immunocompromised patients or individuals with cystic fibrosis by P. aeruginosa is not understood. To establish whether variation in the genomic repertoire of P. aeruginosa strains can be associated with a particular type of infection, we used a whole-genome DNA microarray to determine the genome content of 18 strains isolated from the most common human infections and environmental sources. A remarkable conservation of genes including those encoding nearly all known virulence factors was observed. Phylogenetic analysis of strain-specific genes revealed no correlation between genome content and infection type. Clusters of strain-specific genes in the P. aeruginosa genome, termed variable segments, appear to be preferential sites for the integration of novel genetic material. A specialized cloning vector was developed for capture and analysis of these genomic segments. With this capture system a site associated with the strain-specific ExoU cytotoxin-encoding gene was interrogated and an 80-kb genomic island carrying exoU was identified. These studies demonstrate that P. aeruginosa strains possess a highly conserved genome that encodes genes important for survival in numerous environments and allows it to cause a variety of human infections. The acquisition of novel genetic material, such as the exoU genomic island, through horizontal gene transfer may enhance colonization and survival in different host environments.

16640791|a|Rhizobium leguminosarum is an alpha-proteobacterial N2-fixing symbiont of legumes that has been the subject of more than a thousand publications. Genes for the symbiotic interaction with plants are well studied, but the adaptations that allow survival and growth in the soil environment are poorly understood. We have sequenced the genome of R. leguminosarum biovar viciae strain 3841.The 7.75 Mb genome comprises a circular chromosome and six circular plasmids, with 61% G+C overall. All three rRNA operons and 52 tRNA genes are on the chromosome; essential protein-encoding genes are largely chromosomal, but most functional classes occur on plasmids as well. Of the 7,263 protein-encoding genes, 2,056 had orthologs in each of three related genomes (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Sinorhizobium meliloti, and Mesorhizobium loti), and these genes were over-represented in the chromosome and had above average G+C. Most supported the rRNA-based phylogeny, confirming A. tumefaciens to be the closest among these relatives, but 347 genes were incompatible with this phylogeny; these were scattered throughout the genome but were over-represented on the plasmids. An unexpectedly large number of genes were shared by all three rhizobia but were missing from A. tumefaciens.Overall, the genome can be considered to have two main components: a 'core', which is higher in G+C, is mostly chromosomal, is shared with related organisms, and has a consistent phylogeny; and an 'accessory' component, which is sporadic in distribution, lower in G+C, and located on the plasmids and chromosomal islands. The accessory genome has a different nucleotide composition from the core despite a long history of coexistence.

8425221|a|We describe a novel cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, termed BPK (B cell progenitor kinase), which is expressed in all stages of the B lineage and in myeloid cells. BPK has classic SH1, SH2, and SH3 domains, but lacks myristylation signals and a regulatory phosphorylation site corresponding to tyrosine 527 of c-src. BPK has a long, basic amino-terminal region upstream of the SH3 domain. BPK was evaluated as a candidate for human X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), an inherited immunodeficiency characterized by a severe deficit of B and plasma cells and profound hypogammaglobulinemia. BPK mapped to within 100 kb of a probe defining the polymorphism most closely linked to XLA at DXS178. Reduction in or the absence of BPK mRNA, protein expression, and kinase activity was observed in XLA pre-B and B cell lines. BPK is likely the XLA gene and functions in pathways critical to B cell expansion.

15771581|a|The Tec family tyrosine kinases are now recognized as important mediators of antigen receptor signaling in lymphocytes. Three members of this family, Itk, Rlk, and Tec, are expressed in T cells and activated in response to T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. Although initial studies demonstrated a role for these proteins in TCR-mediated activation of phospholipase C-gamma, recent data indicate that Tec family kinases also regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular adhesion following TCR stimulation. In addition, Tec family kinases are activated downstream of G protein-coupled chemokine receptors, where they play parallel roles in the regulation of Rho GTPases, cell polarization, adhesion, and migration. In all these systems, however, Tec family kinases are not essential signaling components, but instead function to modulate or amplify signaling pathways. Although they quantitatively reduce proximal signaling, mutations that eliminate Tec family kinases in T cells nonetheless qualitatively alter T cell development and differentiation.

11340625|a|Cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are enzymes involved in transducing a vast number of signals in metazoans. The importance of the Tec family of kinases was immediately recognized when, in 1993, mutations in the gene encoding Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) were reported to cause the human disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Since then, additional kinases belonging to this family have been isolated, and the availability of full genome sequences allows identification of all members in selected species enabling phylogenetic considerations. Tec kinases are endowed with Pleckstrin homology (PH) and Tec homology (TH) domains and are involved in diverse biological processes related to the control of survival and differentiation fate. Membrane translocation resulting in the activation of Tec kinases with subsequent Ca2+ release seems to be a general feature. However, nuclear translocation may also be of importance. The purpose of this essay is to characterize members of the Tec family and discuss their involvement in signaling. The three-dimensional structure, expression pattern and evolutionary aspects will also be considered.

15308100|a|Cyclophilin A (CypA/Ppia) is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that binds the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine. The resulting complex blocks T cell function by inhibiting the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. To identify the native function of CypA, long suspected of regulating signal transduction, we generated mice lacking the Ppia gene. These animals develop allergic disease, with elevated IgE and tissue infiltration by mast cells and eosinophils, that is driven by CD4+ T helper type II (Th2) cytokines. Ppia(-/-) Th2 cells were hypersensitive to TCR stimulation, a phenotype consistent with increased activity of Itk, a Tec family tyrosine kinase crucial for Th2 responses. CypA bound Itk via the PPIase active site. Mutation of a conformationally heterogeneous proline in the SH2 domain of Itk disrupted interaction with CypA and specifically increased Th2 cytokine production from wild-type CD4+ T cells. Thus, CypA inhibits CD4+ T cell signal transduction in the absence of cyclosporine via a regulatory proline residue in Itk.

15345221|a|The Tec family tyrosine kinase, Itk, is critical for PLC-gamma1 activation downstream of the TCR. Studies of Itk-/- mice have demonstrated a requirement for Itk in Th2 cytokine production and protective immunity to parasitic infections. Here we address the mechanism by which Itk regulates Th2 differentiation. We find that naive Itk-/- CD4+ T cells respond normally to cytokine skewing signals and can differentiate efficiently into either Th1 or Th2 lineage cells. In the absence of skewing cytokines, wild-type CD4+ T cells stimulated with low-avidity ligands preferentially express GATA-3 mRNA and differentiate into Th2 cells. Under these same stimulation conditions, Itk-/- T cells produce large amounts of T-bet mRNA and differentiate into IFN-gamma-producing cells. Furthermore, Itk is upregulated during Th2 differentiation, while Rlk, a related Tec kinase, disappears rapidly from differentiating Th2 cells. Together, these findings provide a molecular explanation for the essential role of Itk in Th2 differentiation.

14993283|a|The Tec protein tyrosine kinase is the founding member of a family that includes Btk, Itk, Bmx, and Txk. Btk is essential for B-cell receptor signaling, because mutations in Btk are responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency (xid) in mice, whereas Itk is involved in T-cell receptor signaling. Tec is expressed in both T and B cells, but its role in antigen receptor signaling is not clear. In this study, we show that Tec protein is expressed at substantially lower levels in primary T and B cells relative to Itk and Btk, respectively. However, Tec is up-regulated upon T-cell activation and in Th1 and Th2 cells. In functional experiments that mimic Tec up-regulation, we find that Tec overexpression in lymphocyte cell lines is sufficient to induce phospholipase Cgamma (PLC-gamma) phosphorylation and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) activation. In contrast, overexpression of Btk, Itk, or Bmx does not induce NFAT activation. Tec-induced NFAT activation requires PLC-gamma, but not the adapters LAT, SLP-76, and BLNK, which are required for Btk and Itk to couple to PLC-gamma. Finally, we show that the unique effector function for Tec correlates with a unique subcellular localization. We hypothesize that Tec functions in activated and effector T lymphocytes to induce the expression of genes regulated by NFAT transcription factors.

8777721|a|Itk is a T cell protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) that, along with Btk and Tec, belongs to a family of cytoplasmic PTKs with N-terminal pleckstrin homology domains. Btk plays a critical role in B lymphocyte development. To determine whether Itk has an analogous role in T lymphocytes, we used gene targeting to prepare mice lacking expression of Itk. Such animals had decreased numbers of mature thymocytes, an effect most clearly observed in mice expressing T cell receptor (TCR) transgenes. Mature T cells from Itk-deficient mice had reduced proliferative responses to allogeneic MHC stimulation and to anti-TCR cross-linking, but responded normally to stimulation with phorbol ester plus ionomycin or with IL-2. These results provide genetic evidence that Itk is involved in T cell development and also suggest that Itk has an important role in proximal events in TCR-mediated signaling pathways.

9584150|a|Itk, a Tec family tyrosine kinase, plays an important but as yet undefined role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Here we show that T cells from Itk-deficient mice have a TCR-proximal signaling defect, resulting in defective interleukin 2 secretion. Upon TCR stimulation, Itk-/- T cells release normal amounts of calcium from intracellular stores, but fail to open plasma membrane calcium channels. Since thapsigargin-induced store depletion triggers normal calcium entry in Itk-/- T cells, an impaired biochemical link between store depletion and channel opening is unlikely to be responsible for this defect. Biochemical studies indicate that TCR-induced inositol 1,4,5 tris-phosphate (IP3) generation and phospholipase C gamma1 tyrosine phosphorylation are substantially reduced in Itk-/- T cells. In contrast, TCR-zeta and ZAP-70 are phosphorylated normally, suggesting that Itk functions downstream of, or in parallel to, ZAP-70 to facilitate TCR-induced IP3 production. These findings support a model in which quantitative differences in cytosolic IP3 trigger distinct responses, and in which only high concentrations of IP3 trigger the influx of extracellular calcium.

11104803|a|The cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase Tec has been proposed to have important functions in hematopoiesis and lymphocyte signal transduction. Here we show that Tec-deficient mice developed normally and had no major phenotypic alterations of the immune system. To reveal potential compensatory roles of other Tec kinases such as Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), Tec/Btk double-deficient mice were generated. These mice exhibited a block at the B220(+)CD43(+) stage of B cell development and displayed a severe reduction of peripheral B cell numbers, particularly immunoglobulin (Ig)M(lo)IgD(hi) B cells. Although Tec/Btk(null) mice were able to form germinal centers, the response to T cell-dependent antigens was impaired. Thus, Tec and Btk together have an important role both during B cell development and in the generation and/or function of the peripheral B cell pool. The ability of Tec to compensate for Btk may also explain phenotypic differences in X-linked immunodeficiency (xid) mice compared with human X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) patients.

9326591|a|The Tec family of tyrosine kinases are involved in signals emanating from cytokine receptors, antigen receptors, and other lymphoid cell surface receptors. One family member, ITK (inducible T cell kinase), is involved in T cell activation and can be activated by the T cell receptor and the CD28 cell surface receptor. This stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ITK can be mimicked by the Src family kinase Lck. We have explored the mechanism of this requirement for Src family kinases in the activation of ITK. We found that coexpression of ITK and Src results in increased membrane association, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ITK, which could be blocked by inhibitors of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) as well as overexpression of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Removal of the Pleckstrin homology domain (PH) of ITK resulted in a kinase that could no longer be induced to localize to the membrane or be activated by Src. The PH of ITK was also able to bind inositol phosphates phosphorylated at the D3 position. Membrane targeting of ITK without the PH recovered its ability to be activated by Src. These results suggest that ITK can be activated by a combination of Src and PI 3-kinase.

10570288|a|Expressed in mast and T-cells/inducible T cell tyrosine kinase (Emt/Itk) is a protein tyrosine kinase required for T cell Ag receptor (TCR)-induced activation and development. A physical interaction between Emt/Itk and TCR has not been described previously. Here, we have utilized laser scanning confocal microscopy to demonstrate that Ab-mediated engagement of the CD3epsilon chain induces the membrane colocalization of Emt/Itk with TCR/CD3. Removal of the Emt/Itk pleckstrin homology domain (DeltaPH-Emt/Itk) abrogates the association of the kinase with the cell membrane, as well as its activation-induced colocalization with the TCR complex and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation. The addition of a membrane localization sequence to DeltaPH-Emt/Itk from Lck restores all of these deficiencies except the activation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Our data suggest that the PH domain of Emt/Itk can be replaced with another membrane localization signal without affecting the membrane targeting and activation-induced colocalization of the kinase with the TCR. However, the PH domain is indispensable for the activation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase.

9891083|a|Rlk/Txk is a member of the BTK/Tec family of tyrosine kinases and is primarily expressed in T lymphocytes. Unlike other members of this kinase family, Rlk lacks a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain near the amino terminus and instead contains a distinctive cysteine string motif. We demonstrate here that Rlk protein consists of two isoforms that arise by alternative initiation of translation from the same cDNA. The shorter, internally initiated protein species lacks the cysteine string motif and is located in the nucleus when expressed in the absence of the larger form. In contrast, the larger form is cytoplasmic. We show that the larger form is palmitoylated and that mutation of its cysteine string motif both abolishes palmitoylation and allows the protein to migrate to the nucleus. The cysteine string, therefore, is a critical determinant of both fatty acid modification and protein localization for the larger isoform of Rlk, suggesting that Rlk regulation is distinct from the other Btk family kinases. We further show that Rlk is phosphorylated and changes localization in response to T-cell-receptor (TCR) activation and, like the other Btk family kinases, can be phosphorylated and activated by Src family kinases. However, unlike the other Btk family members, Rlk is activated independently of the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, consistent with its lack of a PH domain. Thus, Rlk has two distinct isoforms, each of which may have unique properties in signaling downstream from the TCR.

8985255|a|The T-cell-specific tyrosine kinase Itk is a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and is required for signalling through the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). The role of Itk in TCR signalling and the manner in which Itk activity is regulated are not well understood. Substrate binding and enzymatic activity of the structurally related Src kinases are regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain and a phosphotyrosine. Although Itk also contains SH3, SH2 and tyrosine kinase domains, it lacks the corresponding regulatory phosphorylation site, and therefore must be regulated by an alternative mechanism. The proline-rich sequence adjacent to the SH3 domain of Tec family kinases contains an SH3 ligand, potentially allowing a different intramolecular interaction. By using multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance we have determined the structure of a fragment of Itk, confirming that these domains interact intramolecularly. Formation of this intramolecular SH3-ligand complex prevents the Itk SH3 domain and proline-rich region from interacting with their respective protein ligands, Sam68 and Grb-2. We believe that this structure represents the first example of an intramolecular interaction between an SH3 domain and a proline-rich ligand, and has implications for the regulation of Tec family kinases.

10636929|a|Itk, a Tec family tyrosine kinase, acts downstream of Lck and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase to facilitate T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent calcium influxes and increases in extracellular-regulated kinase activity. Here we demonstrate interactions between Itk and crucial components of TCR-dependent signaling pathways. First, the inositide-binding pocket of the Itk pleckstrin homology domain directs the constitutive association of Itk with buoyant membranes that are the primary site of TCR activation and are enriched in both Lck and LAT. This association is required for the transphosphorylation of Itk. Second, the Itk proline-rich region binds to Grb2 and LAT. Third, the Itk Src homology (SH3) 3 and SH2 domains interact cooperatively with Syk-phosphorylated SLP-76. Notably, SLP-76 contains a predicted binding motif for the Itk SH2 domain and binds to full-length Itk in vitro. Finally, we show that kinase-inactive Itk can antagonize the SLP-76-dependent activation of NF-AT. The inhibition of NF-AT activation depends on the Itk pleckstrin homology domain, proline-rich region, and SH2 domain. Together, these observations suggest that multivalent interactions recruit Itk to LAT-nucleated signaling complexes and facilitate the activation of LAT-associated phospholipase Cgamma1 by Itk.

10556826|a|Activation of lymphocytes through their antigen receptors leads to mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) ions. This process requires expression of SLP adaptors and involves phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma isoforms by the Tec-related protein tyrosine kinase Btk in B cells and Itk in T cells. The SH2 domain of Btk and Itk is essential for phospholipase C-gamma phosphorylation and mutations in this domain lead to the X-linked agammaglobulinemia immuno deficiency in humans. Here we show that, in contrast to SH2 domains from other signaling proteins, the Btk and Itk SH2 domains exhibit a restricted binding specificity. They bind selectively to tyrosine-phosphorylated SLP-65 and SLP-76 in activated B and T cells, respectively. Our findings suggest that Btk/Itk and phospholipase C-gamma both bind via their SH2 domain to phosphorylated SLP adaptors, and that this association is required for the activation of phospholipase C-gamma.

11861607|a|Engagement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) leads to a complex series of molecular changes at the plasma membrane, in the cytoplasm, and at the nucleus that lead ultimately to T cell effector function. Activation at the TCR of a set of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is an early event in this process. This chapter reviews some of the critical substrates of these PTKs, the adapter proteins that, following phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, serve as binding sites for many of the critical effector enzymes and other adapter proteins required for T cell activation. The role of these adapters in binding various proteins, the interaction of adapters with plasma membrane microdomains, and the function of adapter proteins in control of the cytoskeleton are discussed.

12555096|a|Adaptors are molecular scaffolds that recruit effectors, which are critical for immune cell activation. Recent work has underscored the requirement for adaptors in propagating stimulatory signals as well as their ability to inhibit immune cell function. The mechanisms by which adaptors function rely not only on the intermolecular interactions they mediate, but also on where they are localized within the cell. The use of sophisticated genetic, biochemical, cellular and imaging approaches has provided important new insights into the biology of adaptor protein function. Here we focus on T lymphocytes as a model to illustrate the critical roles adaptors play as regulators of cellular activation.

Macrophage and natural killer cell compartments were intact in SLP-76-deficient mice, despite SLP-76 expression in these lineages in wild-type mice. Thus, the SLP-76 adapter protein is required for normal thymocyte development and plays a crucial role in translating signals mediated by pre-T cell receptors into distal biochemical events.

10204488|a|The linker molecule LAT is a substrate of the tyrosine kinases activated following TCR engagement. Phosphorylated LAT binds many critical signaling molecules. The central role of this molecule in TCR-mediated signaling has been demonstrated by experiments in a LAT-deficient cell line. To probe the role of LAT in T cell development, the LAT gene was disrupted by targeting. LAT-deficient mice appeared healthy. Flow cytometric analysis revealed normal B cell populations but the absence of any mature peripheral T cells. Intrathymic development was blocked within the CD4- CD8- stage. No gross abnormality of NK or platelet function was observed. LAT is thus critical to both T cell activation and development.

12186560|a|The linker for activation of T-cells (LAT) is a palmitoylated integral membrane adaptor protein that resides in lipid membrane rafts and contains nine consensus putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites, several of which have been shown to serve as SH2 binding sites. Upon T-cell antigen receptor (TCR/CD3) engagement, LAT is phosphorylated by protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and binds to the adaptors Gads and Grb2, as well as to phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1), thereby facilitating the recruitment of key signal transduction components to drive T-cell activation. The LAT tyrosine residues Y(132), Y(171), Y(191), and Y(226) have been shown previously to be critical for binding to Gads, Grb2, and PLCgamma1. In this report, we show by generation of LAT truncation mutants that the Syk-family kinase ZAP-70 and the Tec-family kinase Itk favor phosphorylation of carboxy-terminal tyrosines in LAT. By direct binding studies using purified recombinant proteins or phosphopeptides and by mutagenesis of individual tyrosines in LAT to phenylalanine residues, we demonstrate that Y(171) and potentially Y(226) are docking sites for the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Further, overexpression of a kinase-deficient mutant of Itk in T-cells reduced both the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous LAT and the recruitment of Vav to LAT complexes. These data indicate that kinases from distinct PTK families are likely responsible for LAT phosphorylation following T-cell activation and that Itk kinase activity promotes recruitment of Vav to LAT.

17420479|a|ITK (IL-2-inducible T cell kinase), a Tec family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), is one of three PTKs required for T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-induced activation of phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1). Like Src and Abl family PTKs, ITK adopts an inactive, "closed" conformation, and its conversion to the active conformation is not well understood, nor have its direct substrates been identified. In a side-by-side comparison of ITK and ZAP-70 (zeta chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa), ITK efficiently phosphorylated Y(783) and Y(775) of PLC-gamma1, two phosphorylation sites that are critical for its activation, whereas ZAP-70 did not. SLP-76 (SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa), an adaptor required for TCR-induced activation of PLC-gamma1, was required for the phosphorylation of both PLC-gamma1 sites in intact cells. Furthermore, this event depended on the N-terminal tyrosines of SLP-76. Likewise, SLP-76, particularly its N-terminal tyrosines, was required for TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ITK but was not required for the phosphorylation or activation of ZAP-70. Both ZAP-70 and ITK phosphorylated SLP-76 in vitro; thus, both PTKs are potential regulators of SLP-76, but only ITK is regulated by SLP-76. Upon TCR stimulation, a small fraction of ITK bound to SLP-76. This fraction, however, encompassed most of the catalytically active ITK. Catalytic activity was lost upon mild elution of ITK from the SLP-76-nucleated complex but was restored upon reconstitution of the complex. We propose that SLP-76 is required for ITK activation; furthermore, an ongoing physical interaction between SLP-76 and ITK is required to maintain ITK in an active conformation.

Our current understanding of the primary sequence relationships within the class of extracellular phospholipase A2's and among the numerous forms of the mammalian phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C's is reviewed. New results suggesting roles for these phospholipases as well as other phospholipases such as phospholipase C and D acting on phosphatidlycholine in generating arachidonic acid for eicosanoid biosynthesis, inositol phosphates for Ca2+ mobilization, and diglyceride for protein kinase C activation through receptor-mediated processes, are discussed. In addition, the possible role of phospholipases acting on sphingolipids such as sphinglomyelinase in generating lipid mediators is considered.

12842872|a|The Tec family kinase Itk plays a critical role in signal transduction downstream of the T cell antigen receptor and has been implicated in the activation of phospholipase C-gamma1, a key regulator of calcium mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. We have shown previously that Itk is regulated by an activating transphosphorylation event in which Tyr-511 in the kinase domain is phosphorylated by Lck (Heyeck, S. D., Wilcox, H. M., Bunnell, S. C., and Berg, L. J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 25401-25408). In this study, we present evidence for another mode of regulation for Itk, the autophosphorylation of Tyr-180 in the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. To investigate the role of Itk trans- and autophosphorylation in T cell signaling, a retroviral transduction system was used to introduce different versions of Itk into Itk-deficient primary T cells. We report that Itk mutated at either the trans- or the autophosphorylation site is unable to fully restore cytokine production and ERK activation in the Itk-deficient cells; Itk-Y511F is severely defective, whereas Itk-Y180F has partial activity. Because phosphorylation at Tyr-180 is predicted to interfere with ligand binding by the SH3 domain, an SH3 point mutant that cannot bind ligand was also examined and found to be unable to restore function to the Itk-/- cells. These data provide new insights into the complex regulation of Itk in primary T cells.

10562318|a|Recent data indicate that several members of the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases function in antigen receptor signal transduction. Txk, a Tec family protein tyrosine kinase, is expressed in both immature and mature T cells and in mast cells. By overexpressing Txk in T cells throughout development, we found that Txk specifically augments the phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma1-mediated calcium signal transduction pathway upon T cell antigen receptor (TCR) engagement. Although Txk is structurally different from inducible T cell kinase (Itk), another Tec family member expressed in T cells, expression of the Txk transgene could partially rescue defects in positive selection and signaling in itk(-)(/)(-) mice. Conversely, in the itk(+/+) (wild-type) background, overexpression of Txk inhibited positive selection of TCR transgenic thymocytes, presumably due to induction of cell death. These results identify a role for Txk in TCR signal transduction, T cell development, and selection and suggest that the Tec family kinases Itk and Txk perform analogous functions.

11564877|a|Numerous signaling molecules associate with lipid rafts, either constitutively or after engagement of surface receptors. One such molecule, phospholipase Cgamma-1 (PLCgamma1), translocates from the cytosol to lipid rafts during T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. To investigate the role played by lipid rafts in the activation of this molecule in T cells, an influenza virus hemagglutinin A (HA)-tagged PLCgamma1 was ectopically expressed in Jurkat T cells and targeted to these microdomains by the addition of a dual-acylation signal. Raft-targeted PLCgamma1 was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and induced constitutive NF-AT-dependent transcription and interleukin-2 secretion in Jurkat cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of raft-targeted PLCgamma1 did not require Zap-70 or the interaction with the adapters Lat and Slp-76, molecules that are necessary for TCR signaling. In contrast, the Src family kinase Lck was required. Coexpression in HEK 293T cells of PLCgamma1-HA with Lck or the Tec family kinase Rlk resulted in preferential phosphorylation of raft-targeted PLCgamma1 over wild-type PLCgamma1. These data show that localization of PLCgamma1 in lipid rafts is sufficient for its activation and demonstrate a role for lipid rafts as microdomains that dynamically segregate and integrate PLCgamma1 with other signaling components.

14614854|a|Intracellular signaling by most cell surface receptors requires the generation of two major second messengers, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). The enzymes that produce these second messengers, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C (PLC), utilize a common substrate, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2). Until now, it has not been clear whether de novo PtdIns-4,5-P2 synthesis is necessary for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and IP3 production. Here we show that BTK, a member of the Tec family of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, associates with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks), the enzymes that synthesize PtdIns-4,5-P2. Upon B cell receptor activation, BTK brings PIP5K to the plasma membrane as a means of generating local PtdIns-4,5-P2 synthesis. This enzyme-enzyme interaction provides a shuttling mechanism that allows BTK to stimulate the production of the substrate required by both its upstream activator, PI3K, and its downstream target, PLC-gamma2.

17412921|a|Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-mediated protein recruitment to cellular membranes is of paramount importance for signal transduction. The recruitment of many PH domains is controlled through production and turnover of their membrane ligand, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). We show that phosphorylation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) into inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) establishes another mode of PH domain regulation through a soluble ligand. At physiological concentrations, IP4 promoted PH domain binding to PIP3. In primary mouse CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, this was required for full activation of the protein tyrosine kinase Itk after T cell receptor engagement. Our data suggest that IP4 establishes a feedback loop of phospholipase C-gamma1 activation through Itk that is essential for T cell development.

18515054|a|In cells of the immune system, calcium signals are essential for diverse cellular functions including differentiation, effector function, and gene transcription. After the engagement of immunoreceptors such as T-cell and B-cell antigen receptors and the Fc receptors on mast cells and NK cells, the intracellular concentration of calcium ions is increased through the sequential operation of two interdependent processes: depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores as a result of binding of inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)) to IP(3) receptors, followed by 'store-operated' Ca(2+) entry through plasma membrane Ca(2+) channels. In lymphocytes, mast cells and other immune cell types, store-operated Ca(2+) entry through specialized Ca(2+) release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels constitutes the major pathway of intracellular Ca(2+) increase. A recent breakthrough in our understanding of CRAC channel function is the identification of stromal interaction molecule (STIM) and ORAI, two essential regulators of CRAC channel function. This review focuses on the signaling pathways upstream and downstream of Ca(2+) influx (the STIM/ORAI and calcineurin/NFAT pathways, respectively).

18596693|a|Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels generate sustained Ca(2+) signals that are essential for a range of cell functions, including antigen-stimulated T lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Recent studies have revealed that the depletion of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers the oligomerization of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the ER Ca(2+) sensor, and its redistribution to ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions where the CRAC channel subunit ORAI1 accumulates in the plasma membrane and CRAC channels open. However, how the loss of ER Ca(2+) sets into motion these coordinated molecular rearrangements remains unclear. Here we define the relationships among [Ca(2+)](ER), STIM1 redistribution and CRAC channel activation and identify STIM1 oligomerization as the critical [Ca(2+)](ER)-dependent event that drives store-operated Ca(2+) entry. In human Jurkat leukaemic T cells expressing an ER-targeted Ca(2+) indicator, CRAC channel activation and STIM1 redistribution follow the same function of [Ca(2+)](ER), reaching half-maximum at approximately 200 microM with a Hill coefficient of approximately 4. Because STIM1 binds only a single Ca(2+) ion, the high apparent cooperativity suggests that STIM1 must first oligomerize to enable its accumulation at ER-PM junctions. To assess directly the causal role of STIM1 oligomerization in store-operated Ca(2+) entry, we replaced the luminal Ca(2+)-sensing domain of STIM1 with the 12-kDa FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP12, also known as FKBP1A) or the FKBP-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, also known as FRAP1). A rapamycin analogue oligomerizes the fusion proteins and causes them to accumulate at ER-PM junctions and activate CRAC channels without depleting Ca(2+) from the ER. Thus, STIM1 oligomerization is the critical transduction event through which Ca(2+) store depletion controls store-operated Ca(2+) entry, acting as a switch that triggers the self-organization and activation of STIM1-ORAI1 clusters at ER-PM junctions.

18820677|a|Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels underlie sustained Ca(2+) signalling in lymphocytes and numerous other cells after Ca(2+) liberation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). RNA interference screening approaches identified two proteins, Stim and Orai, that together form the molecular basis for CRAC channel activity. Stim senses depletion of the ER Ca(2+) store and physically relays this information by translocating from the ER to junctions adjacent to the plasma membrane, and Orai embodies the pore of the plasma membrane calcium channel. A close interaction between Stim and Orai, identified by co-immunoprecipitation and by Förster resonance energy transfer, is involved in the opening of the Ca(2+) channel formed by Orai subunits. Most ion channels are multimers of pore-forming subunits surrounding a central channel, which are preassembled in the ER and transported in their final stoichiometry to the plasma membrane. Here we show, by biochemical analysis after cross-linking in cell lysates and intact cells and by using non-denaturing gel electrophoresis without cross-linking, that Orai is predominantly a dimer in the plasma membrane under resting conditions. Moreover, single-molecule imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Orai expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed predominantly two-step photobleaching, again consistent with a dimeric basal state. In contrast, co-expression of GFP-tagged Orai with the carboxy terminus of Stim as a cytosolic protein to activate the Orai channel without inducing Ca(2+) store depletion or clustering of Orai into punctae yielded mostly four-step photobleaching, consistent with a tetrameric stoichiometry of the active Orai channel. Interaction with the C terminus of Stim thus induces Orai dimers to dimerize, forming tetramers that constitute the Ca(2+)-selective pore. This represents a new mechanism in which assembly and activation of the functional ion channel are mediated by the same triggering molecule.

10807788|a|Stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alters a number of intracellular signaling pathways including one that involves protein tyrosine kinases, phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1), diacylglycerol (DAG), and calcium messengers. By a divergent pathway, TCR-stimulated protein tyrosine kinase activity is thought to result independently in recruitment of the Ras activator Sos to the plasma membrane, leading to Ras activation. Here we show that RasGRP, a Ras activator that contains calcium-binding EF hands and a DAG-binding domain, is expressed in T cells. A PLC-gamma1 inhibitor diminished activation of Ras following TCR stimulation. Membranes from TCR-stimulated Jurkat T cells exhibited increased RasGRP and increased Ras-guanyl nucleotide association activity that was inhibited by antibodies directed against RasGRP. Overexpression of RasGRP in T cells enhanced TCR-Ras-Erk signaling and augmented interleukin-2 secretion in response to calcium ionophore plus DAG analogues phorbol ester myristate or bryostatin-1. Thus, RasGRP links TCR and PLC-gamma1 to Ras-Erk signaling, a pathway amenable to pharmacologic manipulation.

17283063|a|Ras activation is crucial for lymphocyte development and effector function. Both T and B lymphocytes contain two types of Ras activators: ubiquitously expressed SOS and specifically expressed Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP). The need for two activators is enigmatic since both are activated following antigen receptor stimulation. In addition, RasGRP1 appears to be dominant over SOS in an unknown manner. The crystal structure of SOS provides a clue: an unusual allosteric Ras-GTP binding pocket. Here, we demonstrate that RasGRP orchestrates Ras signaling in two ways: (i) by activating Ras directly and (ii) by facilitating priming of SOS with RasGTP that binds the allosteric pocket. Priming enhances SOS' in vivo activity and creates a positive RasGTP-SOS feedback loop that functions as a rheostat for Ras activity. Without RasGRP1, initiation of this loop is impaired because SOS' catalyst is its own product (RasGTP)-hence the dominance of RasGRP1. Introduction of an active Ras-like molecule (RasV12C40) in T- and B-cell lines can substitute for RasGRP function and enhance SOS' activity via its allosteric pocket. The unusual RasGRP-SOS interplay results in sensitive and robust Ras activation that cannot be achieved with either activator alone. We hypothesize that this mechanism enables lymphocytes to maximally respond to physiologically low levels of stimulation.

11313393|a|Ag recognition triggered at the interface between a T cell and an APC is conditioned by cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal remodeling. The role played in these phenomena by Lck and Itk, two protein tyrosine kinases essential for T cell signaling, was examined. Early T cell responses (membrane ruffling, Ca(2+) response, APC-T cell adhesion) were monitored in T cells overexpressing kinase-defective (KD) Lck and Itk mutants by combining fluorescence imaging and electron microscopy. Neither Lck nor Itk appears to be involved in the Ag-independent formation of a small and labile contact interface between T cells and APCS: By contrast, the Ag-induced Ca(2+) response in a cell population is similarly blunted in both KD transfectants. However, the underlying mechanisms are strikingly different for the two kinases. The major effect of Lck-KD is to reduce the probability of giving rise to quasi-normal Ca(2+) responses, whereas overexpression of Itk-KD results in a tuning down of all single-cell Ca(2+) responses. In addition, Lck, but not Itk, is required for the formation of a stable T/APC conjugate and for T cell polarization after Ag stimulation. Overall, our results lead to a clear distinction between Lck and ITK: Lck plays an ignition role, controlling all the downstream events tested here, whereas Itk amplifies the Ca(2+) response, but is dispensable for APC-induced adhesive and morphological responses.

16623767|a|Signaling through lymphocyte antigen receptors has the potential to initiate several distinct outcomes: proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, or functional unresponsiveness. Expansion and differentiation of effector T cells is required for defense against foreign antigens, whereas functional unresponsiveness, termed anergy, is a cell-intrinsic mechanism that contributes to peripheral self-tolerance. Other mechanisms of peripheral tolerance include the 'dominant' tolerance imposed by regulatory T cells and immunosuppression mediated by interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta. T- and B-cell antigen receptor ligation induces an increase in intracellular calcium levels as well as activating additional signaling pathways that are further potentiated by costimulatory receptors. In this review, we argue that cell-intrinsic programs of peripheral anergy and tolerance are imposed by sustained calcium signaling in lymphocytes. We address in particular the role of the calcium-dependent transcription factor nuclear factor for activation of T cells, which is activated by antigen receptor stimulation and, depending on the presence or absence of input from its transcriptional partner, activator protein-1, dictates two distinct transcriptional programs: activation or tolerance.

18759932|a|Both diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidic acid (PA) are important second messengers involved in signal transduction from many immune cell receptors and can be generated and metabolized through multiple mechanisms. Recent studies indicate that diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs), the enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation of DAG to produce PA, play critical roles in regulating the functions of multiple immune cell lineages. In T cells, two DGK isoforms, alpha and zeta, inhibit DAG-mediated signaling following T-cell receptor engagement and prevent T-cell hyperactivation. DGK alpha and zeta synergistically promote T-cell anergy and are critical for T-cell tolerance. In mast cells, DGKzeta plays differential roles in their activation by promoting degranulation but attenuating cytokine production following engagement of the high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E. In dendritic cells and macrophages, DGKzeta positively regulates Toll-like receptor-induced proinflammatory cytokine production through its product PA and is critical for host defense against Toxoplasma gondii infection. These studies demonstrate pivotal roles of DGKs in regulating immune cell function by acting both as signal terminator and initiator.

12577055|a|Functional discrimination between structurally similar self and foreign antigens is a main attribute of adaptive immunity. Here we describe two feedback mechanisms in T lymphocytes that together sharpen and amplify initial signaling differences related to the quality of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. Weakly binding ligands predominantly trigger a negative feedback loop leading to rapid recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, followed by receptor desensitization through inactivation of Lck kinase. In contrast, strongly binding ligands efficiently activate a positive feedback circuit involving Lck modification by ERK, preventing SHP-1 recruitment and allowing the long-lasting signaling necessary for gene activation. The characteristics of these pathways suggest that they constitute an important part of the mechanism allowing T cells to discriminate between self and foreign ligands.

In recent years, a series of in vivo studies have shown that the situation is far more complex; specifically, PKC-theta signaling is differentially required for Th1, Th2, Th17 and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell responses. These studies highlight the combination of signals that directly regulate T-cell differentiation and effector responses.

Failure to express IL-4 occurred even among cells that had gone through multiple cell divisions and was associated with a delay in the kinetics and magnitude of NFATc nuclear localization. IL-4 production was restored genetically by retroviral reconstitution of Itk or biochemically by augmenting the calcium flux with ionomycin. In vivo, Itk-deficient mice were unable to establish functional Th2 cells. Development of protective Th1 cells was unimpeded. These data define a nonredundant role for Itk in modulating signals from the TCR/CD28 pathways that are specific for the establishment of stable IL-4 but not IFNgamma expression.

11702066|a|The Tec kinases Rlk and Itk are critical for full T cell receptor (TCR)-induced activation of phospholipase C-gamma and mitogen-activated protein kinase. We show here that the mutation of Rlk and Itk impaired activation of the transcription factors NFAT and AP-1 and production of both T helper type 1 (TH1) and TH2 cytokines. Consistent with these biochemical defects, Itk-/- mice did not generate effective TH2 responses when challenged with Schistosoma mansoni eggs. Paradoxically, the more severely impaired Rlk-/-Itk-/- mice were able to mount a TH2 response and produced TH2 cytokines in response to this challenge. In addition, Rlk-/-Itk-/- cells showed impaired TCR-induced repression of the TH2-inducing transcription factor GATA-3, suggesting a potential mechanism for TH2 development in these hyporesponsive cells. Thus, mutations that affect Tec kinases lead to complex alterations in CD4+ TH cell differentiation.

17617602|a|T cell activation and differentiation is accompanied and mediated by transcriptional reprogramming. The NFATc1 transcription factor is strongly induced upon T cell activation and controls numerous genes involved in the T cell effector function. However, its regulation by physiological stimuli in primary T cells has not been well understood. We previously found that ICOS synergizes with TCR and CD28 to greatly enhance NFATc1 expression in primary T cells. In this study, we have examined the signaling mechanisms whereby costimulation regulates NFATc1 expression. We found that CD28 and ICOS regulate sustained PI3K activity in primary T cells, which is required for NFATc1 up-regulation. CD28 and ICOS costimulation, possibly through Itk, a Tec kinase downstream of the PI3K, enhanced phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma1 and increased and sustained Ca(2+) flux in T cells. Costimulation of T cells potentiated transcription of the Nfatc1 gene P1 promoter in a PI3K-dependent manner. This work demonstrates an important role for costimulatory receptors in sustaining T cell activation programs leading to Nfatc1 gene transcription and has implications in our understanding of the immune response and tolerance.

12734350|a|Allergic asthma patients manifest airway inflammation and some show increases in eosinophils, T(H)2 cells, and cytokines, increased mucous production in the lung, and elevated serum IgE. This T(H)2-type response suggests a prominent role for T(H)2 cells and their cytokines in the pathology of this disease. The Tec family nonreceptor tyrosine kinase inducible T cell kinase (ITK) has been shown to play a role in the differentiation and/or function of T(H)2-type cells, suggesting that ITK may represent a good target for the control of asthma. Using a murine model of allergic asthma, we show here that ITK is involved in the development of immunological symptoms seen in this model. We show that mice lacking ITK have drastically reduced lung inflammation, eosinophil infiltration, and mucous production following induction of allergic asthma. Notably, T cell influx into the lung was reduced in mice lacking ITK. T cells from ITK(-/-) mice also exhibited reduced proliferation and cytokine secretion, in particular IL-5 and IL-13, in response to challenge with the allergen OVA, despite elevated levels of total IgE and increased OVA-specific IgE responses. Our results suggest that the tyrosine kinase ITK preferentially regulates the secretion of the T(H)2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 and may be an attractive target for antiasthmatic drugs.

In the absence of ITK and RLK, CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes upregulate the T-box transcription factor eomesodermin, and develop into mature CD8(+) T cells that resemble memory cells, exhibit immediate effector cytokine production and depend on IL-15. Furthermore, the selection of these non-conventional 'innate' T cells results from interactions with haematopoietic cells in the thymus. These findings lead to the hypothesis that altered TCR signalling, together with distinct co-stimulatory signals, is the basis for the development of non-conventional T-cell lineages.

18304005|a|T cell cytoarchitecture differs dramatically depending on whether the cell is circulating within the bloodstream, migrating through tissues, or interacting with antigen-presenting cells. The transition between these states requires important signaling-dependent changes in actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Recently, analysis of actin-regulatory proteins associated with T cell activation has provided new insights into how T cells control actin dynamics in response to external stimuli and how actin facilitates downstream signaling events and effector functions. Among the actin-regulatory proteins that have been identified are nucleation-promoting factors such as WASp, WAVE2, and HS1; severing proteins such as cofilin; motor proteins such as myosin II; and linker proteins such as ezrin and moesin. We review the current literature on how signaling pathways leading from diverse cell surface receptors regulate the coordinated activity of these and other actin-regulatory proteins and how these proteins control T cell function.

18501768|a|More than a quarter of a century has passed since the observation that T cells rapidly polarize their actin and microtubule cytoskeletal systems toward antigen-presenting cells during activation. Since this initial discovery, several receptors on T cells (e.g., T cell receptor [TCR], co-receptors, integrins, and chemokine receptors) have been identified to regulate these two cytoskeletal networks through complex signaling pathways, which are still being elucidated. There is now an undeniable body of biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic evidence indicating that regulators of actin and microtubule dynamics are crucial for T cell activation and effector functions. In fact, the actin cytoskeleton participates in the initial clustering of TCR-major histocompatibility complex or peptide complexes, formation and stabilization of the immune synapse, integrin-mediated adhesion, and receptor sequestration, whereas both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons regulate the establishment of cell polarity, cell migration, and directed secretion of cytokines and cytolytic granules. Over the past several years, we have begun to more thoroughly understand the contributions of specific actin-regulatory and actin-nucleating proteins that govern these processes. Herein, we discuss our current understanding of how activating receptors on T lymphocytes regulate the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, and how in turn, these distinct but integrated cytoskeletal networks coordinate T cell immune responses.

18275476|a|T-cell activation requires 'contact' with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to bring the T-cell receptor (TCR) and antigenic major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complex together. Contact is defined by the size of the TCR and MHC-peptide complex, which at approximately 13 nm requires extensive interdigitation of the glycocalyx of the T cell and APC. T cells may be activated through formation of a stable T cell-APC junction, referred to as an immunological synapse. It has also been shown in vitro that T cells can integrate signals from APCs without a stable interaction. In vivo imaging studies supported the importance of both motile and stable T cell-APC interactions in T-cell priming. We have found that stability depends not upon turning off motile machinery but by symmetrization of force-generating structures to balance forces and hold the cell in place. Motility is induced by breaking this symmetry, which may be necessary to maintain the differentiation potential of the T cell. Recently, we also discovered a mode of T-cell signaling leading to tolerance in vivo based purely on motile interactions. Because this entire process takes place in a state of continuous T-cell kinesis, I propose the term 'kinapse' for motile T cell-APC contacts leading to signaling. Synapses and kinapses are inter-convertible by symmetrization/symmetry breaking processes, and both modes appear to be involved in normal T-cell priming. Imbalance of synapse/kinapse states may lead to immunopathology.

18760640|a|The role of the center of the immunological synapse (the central supramolecular activation cluster or cSMAC) is controversial. One model suggests that the role of the cSMAC depends on antigen quality and can both enhance signaling and receptor downregulation, whereas a second model proposes that the sole function of the cSMAC is to downregulate signaling. An important distinction between the models is whether signaling occurs in the cSMAC. Here, we demonstrate that at early time points, signaling occurs outside the cSMAC, but occurs in the cSMAC at later time points. Additionally, we show that cSMAC formation enhances the stimulatory potency of weak agonists for the TCR. Combined with previous studies showing that cSMAC formation decreases the signaling by strong agonists, our data support a model proposing that signaling and receptor degradation both occur in the cSMAC and that the balance between signaling and degradation in the synapse is determined by antigen quality.

19022740|a|Numerous tissues in long-lived organisms are composed of short-lived cells. The continual regeneration of some barrier surfaces, for example, relies on adult stem cells that have the capacity to divide and produce one daughter cell destined for terminal differentiation and function and another daughter cell that renews the stem cell fate. The immune system of higher animals possesses a cellular component called lymphocytes, which face a similar need for regeneration. A lymphocyte that is recruited during an infection must give rise to cellular progeny that undergo terminal differentiation to eliminate an invading microbe, yet retain progeny that replace the recruited cell in order to maintain immunity to reinfection. Emerging evidence suggests that specifying the divergent cell fates necessary for immunity relies on the ability of the lymphocyte to exploit an evolutionarily conserved strategy for making kindred cells different--asymmetric cell division. Although the lymphocyte does not possess constitutive polarity, it appears to use a facultative interaction with another cell to nucleate unequal segregation of fate determinants relative to its plane of division. Herein, we propose that other mobile and nonadherent cells, such as blood and cancer stem cells, might exploit provisional interactions with their niche or microenvironment to achieve diversity among their daughter cells.

11607839|a|The Vav family is a group of signal transduction molecules with oncogenic potential that play important roles in development and cell signaling. Members of this family are distributed in all animal metazoans but not in unicellular organisms. Recent genomic studies suggest that the function of Vav proteins co-evolved with tyrosine kinase pathways, probably to assure the optimal conversion of extracellular signals into biological responses coupled to the cytoskeleton and gene transcription. To date, the best-known function of Vav proteins is their role as GDP/GTP exchange factors for Rho/Rac molecules, a function strictly controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation. Recent publications indicate that this function is highly dependent on the interaction of adaptor proteins that aid in the proper phosphorylation of Vav proteins, their interaction with other signaling molecules, and in modulating the strength of their signal outputs. In addition to the function of Vav proteins as exchange factors, there is increasing evidence suggesting that Vav proteins can mediate other cellular functions independently of their exchange activities, probably by working themselves as adaptor molecules. In this review, we will give a summary of the recent advances in this field, placing special emphasis on the non-catalytic roles of Vav and its interaction with other adaptor molecules.

15886116|a|The Vav family proteins (Vav1, Vav2, Vav3) are cytoplasmic guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho-family GTPases. T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signalling results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav proteins and hence their activation. Results from mice deficient in one or more Vav proteins has shown that they play critical roles in T-cell development and activation. Vav1 is required for TCR-induced calcium flux, activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway, activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor, inside-out activation of the integrin LFA-1, TCR clustering, and polarisation of the T cell. Although many of these processes may require the GEF activity of Vav1, it is possible that Vav1 also has adaptor-like functions. Recent evidence suggests that Vav1 might also function in the nucleus, where it undergoes arginine methylation. An emerging theme is that Vav proteins may have important functions downstream of receptors other than the TCR, such as integrins and chemokine receptors.

Although WAVE2 mediates integrin affinity maturation by recruiting vinculin and talin to the immunological synapse in an Arp2/3-dependent manner, the mechanism by which it regulates integrin clustering is unclear. We show that the Abl tyrosine kinase associates with the WAVE2 complex and TCR ligation induces WAVE2-dependent membrane recruitment of Abl. Furthermore, we show that WAVE2 regulates TCR-mediated activation of the integrin regulatory guanosine triphosphatase Rap1 via the recruitment and activation of the CrkL-C3G exchange complex. Moreover, we demonstrate that although Abl does not regulate the recruitment of CrkL-C3G into the membrane, it does affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G, which is required for its guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity toward Rap1. This signaling node regulates not only TCR-stimulated integrin clustering but also affinity maturation. These findings identify a previously unknown mechanism by which the WAVE2 complex regulates TCR signaling to Rap1 and integrin activation.

Furthermore, Itk(-/-) murine T cells display significant defects in TCR/CD3-induced actin polymerization. In addition, Jurkat cells deficient in linker for activation of T cells expression, an adaptor critical for Itk activation, display impaired cytoskeletal events and expression of SH3 mutant Itk transgenes reconstitutes this impairment. Interestingly, expression of an Itk kinase-dead mutant transgene into Jurkat cells has no effect on cytoskeletal events. Collectively, these data suggest that Itk regulates TCR/CD3-induced actin-dependent cytoskeletal events, possibly in a kinase-independent fashion.

13678593|a|Actin polymerization at the immune synapse is required for T cell activation and effector function; however, the relevant regulatory pathways remain poorly understood. We showed previously that binding to antigen presenting cells (APCs) induces localized activation of Cdc42 and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) at the immune synapse. Several lines of evidence suggest that Tec kinases could interact with WASP-dependent actin regulatory processes. Since T cells from Rlk-/-, Itk-/-, and Rlk-/- x Itk-/- mice have defects in signaling and development, we asked whether Itk or Rlk function in actin polymerization at the immune synapse. We find that Itk-/- and Rlk-/- x Itk-/- T cells are defective in actin polymerization and conjugate formation in response to antigen-pulsed APCs. Itk functions downstream of the TCR, since similar defects were observed upon TCR engagement alone. Using conformation-specific probes, we show that although the recruitment of WASP and Arp2/3 complex to the immune synapse proceeds normally, the localized activation of Cdc42 and WASP is defective. Finally, we find that the defect in Cdc42 activation likely stems from a requirement for Itk in the recruitment of Vav to the immune synapse. Our results identify Itk as a key element of the pathway leading to localized actin polymerization at the immune synapse.

15661896|a|The Tec family kinase Itk is an important regulator of Ca(2+) mobilization and is required for in vivo responses to Th2-inducing agents. Recent data also implicate Itk in TCR-induced regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. We have evaluated the requirements for Itk function in TCR-induced actin polarization. Reduction of Itk expression via small interfering RNA treatment of the Jurkat human T lymphoma cell line or human peripheral blood T cells disrupted TCR-induced actin polarization, a defect that correlated with decreased recruitment of the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor to the site of Ag contact. Vav localization and actin polarization could be rescued by re-expression of either wild-type or kinase-inactive murine Itk but not by Itk containing mutations affecting the pleckstrin homology or Src homology 2 domains. Additionally, we find that Itk is constitutively associated with Vav. Loss of Itk expression did not alter gross patterns of Vav tyrosine phosphorylation but appeared to disrupt the interactions of Vav with SLP-76. Expression of membrane-targeted Vav, Vav-CAAX, can rescue the small interfering RNA to Itk-induced phenotype, implicating the alteration in Vav localization as directly contributing to the actin polarization defect. These data suggest a kinase-independent scaffolding function for Itk in the regulation of Vav localization and TCR-induced actin polarization.

17624943|a|The Tec family non-receptor tyrosine kinases have been recognized for their roles in the regulation of phospholipase C-gamma and Ca(2+) mobilization downstream from antigen receptors on lymphocytes. Recent data, however, show that the Tec family kinase interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (Itk) also participates in pathways regulating the actin cytoskeleton and 'inside-out' signaling to integrins downstream from the T-cell antigen receptor. Data suggest that Itk may function in a kinase-independent fashion to regulate proper recruitment of the Vav1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor. By enhancing actin cytoskeleton reorganization, recruitment of signaling molecules to the immune synapse, and integrin clustering in response to both antigen and chemokine receptors, the Tec kinases serve as modulators or amplifiers that can increase the duration of T-cell signaling and regulate T-cell functional responses.

19009524|a|Vav1 and the Tec family kinase Itk act in similar T-cell activation pathways. Both molecules interact with members of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, and signaling defects in Vav1(-/-) T cells are rescued upon deletion of Cbl-b. In this study we investigate the relation between Itk and Cbl-b or Vav1 by generating Itk/Cbl-b and Itk/Vav1 double-deficient mice. Deletion of Cbl-b in Itk(-/-) CD4(+) T cells restored proliferation and partially IL-2 production, and also led to a variable rescue of IL-4 production. Thus, Itk and Vav1 act mechanistically similarly in peripheral T cells, since the defects in Itk(-/-) T cells, as in Vav1(-/-) T cells, are rescued if cells are released from the negative regulation mediated by Cbl-b. In addition, only few peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were present in Vav1(-/-)Itk(-/-) mice due to severely impaired thymocyte differentiation. Vav1(-/-)Itk(-/-) thymocyte numbers were strongly reduced compared with WT, Itk(-/-) or Vav1(-/-) mice, and double-positive thymocytes displayed increased cell death and impaired positive selection. Therefore, our data also reveal that the combined activity of Vav1 and Itk is required for proper T-cell development and the generation of the peripheral T-cell pool.

10077632|a|Vav is a GTP/GDP exchange factor (GEF) for members of the Rho-family of GTPases that is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated after engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR), suggesting that it may transduce signals from the receptor. T cells from mice made Vav-deficient by gene targeting (Vav-/-) fail to proliferate in response to TCR stimulation because they fail to secrete IL-2. We now show that this is due at least in part to the failure to initiate IL-2 gene transcription. Furthermore, we analyze TCR-proximal signaling pathways in Vav-/- T cells and show that despite normal activation of the Lck and ZAP-70 tyrosine kinases, the mutant cells have specific defects in TCR-induced intracellular calcium fluxes, in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinases and in the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Finally, we show that the greatly reduced TCR-induced calcium flux of Vav-deficient T cells is an important cause of their proliferative defect, because restoration of the calcium flux with a calcium ionophore reverses the phenotype.

10602036|a|Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a member of the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) characterized by an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (PH) thought to directly interact with phosphoinositides. We report here that wild-type (wt) and also a gain-of-function mutant of Btk are redistributed following a wide range of receptor-mediated stimuli through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) activation. Employing chimeric Btk with green fluorescent protein in transient transfections resulted in Btk translocation to the cytoplasmic membrane of live cells through various forms of upstream PI 3-K activation. The redistribution was blocked by pharmacological and biological inhibitors of PI 3-K. A gain-of-function mutant of Btk was found to be a potent inducer of lamellipodia and/or membrane ruffle formation. In the presence of constitutively active forms of Rac1 and Cdc42, Btk is co-localized with actin in these regions. Formation of the membrane structures was blocked by the dominant negative form of N17-Rac1. Therefore, Btk forms a link between a vast number of cell surface receptors activating PI 3-K and certain members of the Rho-family of small GTPases. In the chicken B cell line, DT40, cells lacking Btk differed from wt cells in the actin pattern and showed decreased capacity to form aggregates, further suggesting that cytoskeletal regulation mediated by Btk may be of physiological relevance.

10391917|a|A fraction of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) co-localizes with actin fibers upon stimulation of mast cells via the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI). In this study, a molecular basis of the Btk co-localization with actin fibers is presented. Btk and other Tec family tyrosine kinases have a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at their N termini. The PH domain is a short peptide module frequently found in signal-transducing proteins and cytoskeletal proteins. Filamentous actin (F-actin) is shown to be a novel ligand for a subset of PH domains, including that of Btk. The actin-binding site was mapped to a 10-residue region of the N-terminal region of Btk. Basic residues in this short stretch are demonstrated to be involved in actin binding. Isolated PH domains induced actin filament bundle formation. Consistent with these observations, Btk binds F-actin in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type Btk protein is in part translocated to the cytoskeleton upon FcepsilonRI cross-linking, whereas Btk containing a mutated PH domain is not. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4, 5-trisphosphate-mediated membrane translocation of Btk was enhanced in cytochalasin D-pretreated, FcepsilonRI-stimulated mast cells. These data indicate that PH domain-mediated F-actin binding plays a role in Btk co-localization with actin filaments.

17624944|a|Integrin adhesion receptors are critical for antigen recognition by T cells and for regulated recirculation and trafficking into and through various tissues in the body. T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling induces rapid increases in integrin function that facilitate T-cell activation by promoting stable contact with antigen-presenting cells and extracellular proteins in the environment. In this review, we outline the molecular mechanisms by which the TCR signals to integrins and present a model that highlights four key events: (i) initiation of proximal TCR signals nucleated by the linker for activated T cells (LAT) adapter protein and involving Itk, phospholipase C-gamma1, Vav1, and Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte-specific phosphoprotein of 76 kDa; (ii) transmission of integrin activation signals from the LAT signalosome to integrins by protein kinase (PK) C and the adapter protein, adhesion and degranulation-promoting adapter protein; (iii) assembly of integrin-associated signaling complexes that include PKD, the guanosine triphosphatase Rap1 and its effectors, and talin; and (iv) reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by WAVE2 and other actin-remodeling proteins. These events coordinate changes in integrin conformation and clustering that result in enhanced integrin functional activity following TCR stimulation.

16237085|a|T cells deficient in the Tec kinases Itk or Itk and Rlk exhibit defective TCR-stimulated proliferation, IL-2 production, and activation of phospholipase C-gamma. Evidence also implicates Tec kinases in actin cytoskeleton regulation, which is necessary for cell adhesion and formation of the immune synapse in T lymphocytes. In this study we show that Tec kinases are required for TCR-mediated up-regulation of adhesion via the LFA-1 integrin. We also demonstrate that the defect in adhesion is associated with defective clustering of LFA-1 and talin at the site of interaction of Rlk-/-Itk-/- and Itk-/- T cells with anti-TCR-coated beads. Defective recruitment of Vav1, protein kinase Ctheta, and Pyk2 was also observed in Rlk-/-Itk-/- and Itk-/- T cells. Stimulation with ICAM-2 in conjunction with anti-TCR-coated beads enhanced polarization of Vav1, protein kinase Ctheta, and Pyk2 in wild-type cells, demonstrating a role for integrins in potentiating the recruitment of signaling molecules in T cells. Increased recruitment of signaling molecules was most pronounced under conditions of low TCR stimulation. Under these suboptimal TCR stimulation conditions, ICAM-2 could also enhance the recruitment of signaling molecules in Itk-/-, but not Rlk-/-Itk-/- T cells. Thus, Tec kinases play key roles in regulating TCR-mediated polarization of integrins and signaling molecules to the site of TCR stimulation as well as the up-regulation of integrin adhesion.

11250890|a|Stimulation of T cells via the CD3--T-cell receptor (TCR) complex results in rapid increases in beta 1 integrin-mediated adhesion via poorly defined intracellular signaling events. We demonstrate that TCR-mediated activation of beta 1 integrins requires activation of the Tec family tyrosine kinase Itk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K)-dependent recruitment of Itk to detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (DIGs) via binding of the pleckstrin homology domain of Itk to the PI 3-K product PI(3,4,5)-P(3). Activation of PI 3-K and the src family kinase Lck, via stimulation of the CD4 co-receptor, can initiate beta 1 integrin activation that is dependent on Itk function. Targeting of Itk specifically to DIGs, coupled with CD4 stimulation, can also activate beta 1 integrin function independently of TCR stimulation. Changes in beta 1 integrin function mediated by TCR activation of Itk are also accompanied by Itk-dependent modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, TCR-mediated activation of beta 1 integrins involves membrane relocalization and activation of Itk via coordinate action of PI 3-K and a src family tyrosine kinase.

Chemokines are critical in this response since they are both chemotactic and immunoregulatory molecules. In this regard, the interaction between CCL5 and CCR5 may be critical in regulating T cell functions, by mediating their recruitment and polarization, activation, and differentiation. Various tyrosine phosphorylation signaling cascades can be engaged following chemokine receptor aggregation on T cells, including the Jak-Stat pathway, FAK activation, the MAP kinase pathway, PI3-kinase activation, and transactivation of the T cell receptor. This review will address specific aspects related to chemokine-T cell interactions and the molecular signaling mechanisms that influence T cell function in an inflammatory immune response.

The identification of molecules that interact with Btk may shed light on critical processes in lymphocyte development. The N-terminal unique region of Btk contains a pleckstrin homology domain. This domain is found in a broad array of signaling molecules and implicated to function in protein-protein interactions. By using an in vitro binding assay and an in vivo competition assay, the pleckstrin homology domain of Btk was shown to interact with the beta gamma dimer of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). A highly conserved tryptophan residue in subdomain 6 of the pleckstrin homology domain was shown to play a critical role in the binding. The interaction of Btk with beta gamma suggests the existence of a unique connection between cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and G proteins in cellular signal transduction.

15123627|a|Chemokines are critical in controlling lymphocyte traffic and migration. The CXC chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1alpha interacts with its receptor CXCR4 to induce the migration of a number of different cell types. Although an understanding of the physiological functions of this chemokine is emerging, the mechanism by which it regulates T cell migration is still unclear. We show here that the Tec family kinase ITK is activated rapidly following CXCL12/SDF-1alpha stimulation, and this requires Src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activities. ITK regulates the ability of CXCL12/SDF-1alpha to induce T cell migration as overexpression of wild-type ITK-enhanced migration, and T cells lacking ITK exhibit reduced migration as well as adhesion in response to CXCL12/SDF-1alpha. Further analysis suggests that ITK may regulate CXCR4-mediated migration and adhesion by altering the actin cytoskeleton, as ITK null T cells were significantly defective in CXCL12/SDF-1a-mediated actin polymerization. Our data suggest that ITK may regulate the ability of CXCR4 to induce T cell migration.

15186750|a|Cell polarization and migration in response to chemokines is essential for proper development of the immune system and activation of immune responses. Recent studies of chemokine signaling have revealed a critical role for PI3-Kinase, which is required for polarized membrane association of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins and activation of Rho family GTPases that are essential for cell polarization and actin reorganization. Additional data argue that tyrosine kinases are also important for chemokine-induced Rac activation. However, how and which kinases participate in these pathways remain unclear. We demonstrate here that the Tec kinases Itk and Rlk play an important role in chemokine signaling in T lymphocytes. Chemokine stimulation induced transient membrane association of Itk and phosphorylation of both Itk and Rlk, and purified T cells from Rlk(-/-)Itk(-/-) mice exhibited defective migration to multiple chemokines in vitro and decreased homing to lymph nodes upon transfer to wt mice. Expression of a dominant-negative Itk impaired SDF-1alpha-induced migration, cell polarization, and activation of Rac and Cdc42. Thus, Tec kinases are critical components of signaling pathways required for actin polarization downstream from both antigen and chemokine receptors in T cells.

12734372|a|Tyrosine phosphorylation events play major roles in the initiation and regulation of several functional responses of human neutrophils stimulated by chemotactic factors such as the bacterially derived tripeptide formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe). However, the links between the G protein-coupled receptors, the activation of the tyrosine kinases, and the initiation of neutrophil functional responses remain unclear. In the present study we assessed the effects of a Btk inhibitor, leflunomide metabolite analog (LFM-A13), on neutrophils. LFM-A13 decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by fMet-Leu-Phe and inhibited the production of superoxide anions and the stimulation of adhesion, chemotaxis, and phospholipase D activity. We observed a decreased accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in response to fMet-Leu-Phe in LFM-A13-pretreated cells even though the inhibitor had no direct effect on the lipid kinase activity of the p110 gamma or p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases or on the activation of p110 gamma by fMet-Leu-Phe. The phosphorylation of Akt and of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and p38 were similarly inhibited by LFM-A13. LFM-A13 also negatively affected the translocation of Rac-2, RhoA, ADP ribosylation factor-1, Tec, Bmx, and Btk induced by fMet-Leu-Phe. The results of this study provide evidence for an involvement of Btk and possibly other Tec kinase family members in the regulation of the functional responsiveness of human neutrophils and link these events, in part at least, to the modulation of levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate.

Furthermore, SDF-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2), which, unlike activation of the migration regulatory GTPases Rac or Rap1, was mediated by Btk. PLCgamma2-deficient B cells also exhibited impaired SDF-1-controlled migration. These results reveal that Btk and PLCgamma2 mediate chemokine-controlled migration, thereby providing insights into the control of B cell homeostasis, trafficking, and function, as well as into the pathogenesis of the immunodeficiency disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).

We examined the role of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in CXCL12-induced chemotaxis of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Damnacanthal, a specific Lck inhibitor, but not the Syk inhibitor piceatannol, inhibited CXCL12-induced chemotaxis of both lymphocyte subsets. Similarly, damnacanthal was shown to inhibit CXCL12-induced chemotaxis of the Jurkat T-cell line. Stimulating T and NK cells with CXCL12 increased both the tyrosine phosphorylation and the kinase activity of Lck. A direct involvement of Lck in CXCL12-induced chemotaxis was demonstrated in the Lck-deficient Jurkat-derived cell line JCaM1.6. Although JCaM1.6 cells express CXCR4, no significant migration was detected after CXCL12 stimulation. Reconstitution with wild-type Lck restored both CXCL12-induced chemotaxis and Lck activation. Furthermore, cotransfection of wild-type Lck with C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) into JCaM1.6 failed to restore the chemotactic response induced by CXCL12. Finally, by targeting critical residues in the Src homology-2 (SH2) or SH3 domains of Lck, we observed that the SH3 domain is important for the function of Lck in CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis. Together, these results suggest a role for Lck in CXCL12-induced signaling pathways leading to lymphocyte chemotaxis.

12817019|a|Stimulation of T lymphocytes with the ligand for the CXCR4 chemokine receptor stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha/CXCL12), results in prolonged activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) ERK1 and ERK2. Because SDF-1alpha is unique among several chemokines in its ability to stimulate prolonged ERK activation, this pathway is thought to mediate special functions of SDF-1alpha that are not shared with other chemokines. However, the molecular mechanisms of this response are poorly understood. In this study we show that SDF-1alpha stimulation of prolonged ERK activation in Jurkat T cells requires both the ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase and the Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) scaffold protein. This pathway involves ZAP-70-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 at one or more of its tyrosines, 113, 128, and 145. Because TCR activates ERK via SLP-76-mediated activation of the linker of activated T cells (LAT) scaffold protein, we examined the role of LAT in SDF-1alpha-mediated ERK activation. However, neither the SLP-76 proline-rich domain that links to GADS and LAT, nor LAT, itself are required for SDF-1alpha to stimulate SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation or to activate ERK. Together, our results describe the distinct mechanism by which SDF-1alpha stimulates prolonged ERK activation in T cells and indicate that this pathway is specific for cells expressing both ZAP-70 and SLP-76.

However, the molecular mechanism by which CXCR4 or other G protein-coupled receptors activate ZAP-70 has not been characterized. Here we show that SDF-1alpha stimulates the physical association of CXCR4 and the T cell receptor (TCR) and utilizes the ZAP-70 binding ITAM domains of the TCR for signal transduction. This pathway is responsible for several of the effects of SDF-1alpha on T cells, including prolonged ERK MAP kinase activity, increased intracellular calcium ion concentrations, robust AP-1 transcriptional activity, and SDF-1alpha costimulation of cytokine secretion.

We demonstrate that Jurkat T cells lacking the ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase exhibit reduced migration in response to the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 when compared with wild-type Jurkat T cells. Expression of wild-type, but not kinase-inactive, ZAP-70 resulted in enhanced migration of ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat T cells. The tyrosine residue at position 292 in the interdomain B region of ZAP-70 exerts a negative regulatory effect on ZAP-70-dependent migration. Stimulation of Jurkat T cells with CXCL12 also resulted in ZAP-70-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) adapter protein. Although CXCL12-dependent migration of SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cells was impaired, re-expression of SLP-76 did not enhance migration. These results suggest a novel function for ZAP-70, but not SLP-76, in CXCR4 chemokine receptor signaling in human T cells.

15821738|a|Signals mediated by chemokine receptors may compete with T cell receptor stop signals and determine the duration of T cell-antigen-presenting cell interactions. Here we show that during T cell stimulation by antigen-presenting cells, T cell chemokine receptors coupled to G(q) and/or G(11) protein were recruited to the immunological synapse by a G(i)-independent mechanism. When chemokine receptors were sequestered at the immunological synapse, T cells became insensitive to chemotactic gradients, formed more stable conjugates and finally responded with enhanced proliferation and cytokine production. We suggest that chemokine receptor trapping at the immunological synapse enhances T cell activation by improving T cell-antigen-presenting cell attraction and impeding the 'distraction' of successfully engaged T cells by other chemokine sources.

15748900|a|T cell polarization and redistribution of cellular components are critical to processes such as activation, migration, and potentially HIV infection. Here, we investigate the effects of CD4 engagement on the redistribution and localization of chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, adhesion molecules, and lipid raft components including cholesterol, GM1, and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. We demonstrate that anti-CD4-coated beads (alpha CD4-B) rapidly induce co-capping of chemokine receptors as well as GPI-anchored proteins and adhesion molecules with membrane cholesterol and lipid rafts on human T cell lines and primary T cells to the area of bead-cell contact. This process was dependent on the presence of cellular cholesterol, cytoskeletal reorganization, and lck signaling. Lck-deficient JCaM 1.6 cells failed to cap CXCR4 or lipid rafts to alpha CD4-B. Biochemical analysis reveals that CXCR4 and LFA-1 are recruited to lipid rafts upon CD4 but not CD45 engagement. Furthermore, we also demonstrate T cell capping of both lipid rafts and chemokine receptors at sites of contact with HIV-infected cells, despite the binding of an HIV inhibitory mAb to CXCR4. We conclude that cell surface rearrangements in response to CD4 engagement may serve as a means to enhance cell-to-cell signaling at the immunological synapse and modulate chemokine responsiveness, as well as facilitate HIV entry and expansion by synaptic transmission.

16964261|a|T cell activation in vivo occurs in a lymphoid milieu that presents chemotactic and T cell receptor signals concurrently. Here we demonstrate that T cell zone chemokines such as CCL21 are bound to the surface of lymph node dendritic cells. Contact with antigen-presenting cells bearing chemokines costimulated T cells by a previously unknown two-step contact mechanism. T cells initially formed an antigen-independent 'tethered' adhesion on chemokine-bearing antigen-presenting cells. The formation of those tethers superseded T cell receptor signaling and immunological synapse formation. However, chemokine-tethered T cells were hyper-responsive to subsequent contacts with antigen-presenting cells. Thus, T cells are costimulated 'in trans' and sequentially after initial engagement with their chemokine-rich environment.

However, the potential of chemokines to down-regulate immune responses has not been demonstrated. We now show that certain chemokine gradients have the potential to suppress T cell activation by preventing formation of the immunological synapse, the specialized cell-cell junction that forms before a T cell can be fully activated. Our data reveals an immunosuppressive potential of chemokines engaging the CXCR3 and CCR7 receptors, but not the CXCR4, CCR2, CCR4, or CCR5 receptors.

This protein, designated "fusin," is a putative G protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane segments. Recombinant fusin enabled CD4-expressing nonhuman cell types to support HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion and HIV-1 infection. Antibodies to fusin blocked cell fusion and infection with normal CD4-positive human target cells. Fusin messenger RNA levels correlated with HIV-1 permissiveness in diverse human cell types.

15839891|a|The life cycle of HIV-1 involves a series of steps necessary for the successful infection of human target cells. First the RNA genome enters the cytoplasm after the fusion of the viral membrane and that of the target cell. The RNA genome is then converted to DNA form through the process of reverse transcription. The DNA genome is then integrated into the host cell DNA. Next, viral proteins and more copies of the viral genome are produced. These components assemble to form new virions that are then able to propagate. The cellular proteins involved in HIV-1 entry have been known for more than a decade now and the study of the cellular and viral components involved in HIV-1 entry has led to the development of many therapeutic strategies and drugs designed to block viral replication. Recently, there have been significant advances in the understanding of HIV-1 assembly as a consequence of the identification of the cellular factors that mediate this process. This review will provide a basic outline of the current understanding of HIV-1 entry and exit.

8892894|a|We have identified three types of cytoskeletal proteins inside human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions by analyzing subtilisin-digested particles. HIV-1 virions were digested with protease, and the treated particles were isolated by sucrose density centrifugation. This method removes both exterior viral proteins and proteins associated with microvesicles that contaminate virion preparations. Since the proteins inside the virion are protected from digestion by the viral lipid envelope, they can be isolated and analyzed after treatment. Experiments presented here demonstrated that this procedure removed more than 95% of the protein associated with microvesicles. Proteins in digested HIV-1(MN) particles from infected H9 and CEM(ss) cell lines were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography, protein sequencing, and immunoblotting. The data revealed that three types of cytoskeletal proteins are present in virions at different concentrations relative to the molar level of Gag: actin (approximately 10 to 15%), ezrin and moesin (approximately 2%), and cofilin (approximately 2 to 10%). Our analysis of proteins within virus particles detected proteolytic fragments of alpha-smooth muscle actin and moesin that were cleaved at sites which might be recognized by HIV-1 protease. These cleavage products are not present in microvesicles from uninfected cells. Therefore, these processed proteins are most probably produced by HIV-1 protease digestion. The presence of these fragments, as well as the incorporation of a few specific cytoskeletal proteins into virions, suggests an active interaction between cytoskeletal and viral proteins.

Here, we provide evidence that overexpression of ezrin, another closely related ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family member, also blocks replication of both murine leukemia viruses and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in Rat2 fibroblasts before reverse transcription, while knockdown of endogenous ezrin increases the susceptibility of human cells to HIV-1 infection. Together, these results suggest that ERM proteins may be important determinants of retrovirus susceptibility through negative regulation of stable microtubule networks.

17572668|a|Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection requires envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120-induced clustering of CD4 and coreceptors (CCR5 or CXCR4) on the cell surface; this enables Env gp41 activation and formation of a complex that mediates fusion between Env-containing and target-cell membranes. Kinetic studies show that viral receptors are actively transported to the Env-receptor interface in a process that depends on plasma membrane composition and the actin cytoskeleton. The mechanisms by which HIV-1 induces F-actin rearrangement in the target cell remain largely unknown. Here, we show that CD4 and the coreceptors interact with the actin-binding protein filamin-A, whose binding to HIV-1 receptors regulates their clustering on the cell surface. We found that gp120 binding to cell receptors induces transient cofilin-phosphorylation inactivation through a RhoA-ROCK-dependent mechanism. Blockade of filamin-A interaction with CD4 and/or coreceptors inhibits gp120-induced RhoA activation and cofilin inactivation. Our results thus identify filamin-A as an adaptor protein that links HIV-1 receptors to the actin cytoskeleton remodelling machinery, which may facilitate virus infection.

18295815|a|Ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins supply functional linkage between integral membrane proteins and cytoskeleton in mammalian cells to regulate membrane protein dynamisms and cytoskeleton rearrangement. To assess potential role of the ERM proteins in HIV-1 lifecycle, we examined if suppression of ERM function in human cells expressing HIV-1 infection receptors influences HIV-1 envelope (Env)-mediated HIV-1-vector transduction and cell-cell fusion. Expression of an ezrin dominant negative mutant or knockdown of ezrin, radixin, or moesin with siRNA uniformly decreased transduction titers of HIV-1 vectors having X4-tropic Env. In contrast, transduction titers of R5-tropic Env HIV-1 vectors were decreased only by radixin knockdown: ezrin knockdown had no detectable effects and moesin knockdown rather increased transduction titer. Each of the ERM suppressions had no detectable effects on cell surface expression of CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 or VSV-Env-mediated HIV-1 vector transductions. Finally, the individual knockdown of ERM mRNAs uniformly decreased efficiency of cell-cell fusion mediated by X4- or R5-tropic Env and HIV-1 infection receptors. These results suggest that (i) the ERM proteins function as positive regulators of infection by X4-tropic HIV-1, (ii) moesin additionally functions as a negative regulator of R5-tropic HIV-1 virus infection at the early step(s) after the membrane fusion, and (iii) receptor protein dynamisms are regulated differently in R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1 infections.

Knockdown of moesin by RNA interference resulted in enhanced infection, suggesting that even the endogenous basal levels of moesin in rat fibroblasts are sufficient to limit virus infection. Moesin acts as a crosslinker between plasma membrane and actin filaments, as well as a signal transducer in responses involving cytoskeletal remodeling. Moesin overexpression was found to downregulate the formation of stable microtubules, whereas knockdown of moesin increased stable microtubule formation. A virus-resistant mutant cell line also displayed decreased stable microtubule levels, and virus-sensitive revertants recovered from the mutant line showed restoration of the stable microtubules, suggesting that these cytoskeletal networks play an important role in early post-entry events in the retroviral lifecycle. Together, these results suggest that moesin negatively regulates stable microtubule networks and is a natural determinant of cellular sensitivity to retroviral infection.

18775311|a|Binding of the HIV envelope to the chemokine coreceptors triggers membrane fusion and signal transduction. The fusion process has been well characterized, yet the role of coreceptor signaling remains elusive. Here, we describe a critical function of the chemokine coreceptor signaling in facilitating HIV infection of resting CD4 T cells. We find that static cortical actin in resting T cells represents a restriction and that HIV utilizes the Galphai-dependent signaling from the chemokine coreceptor CXCR4 to activate a cellular actin-depolymerizing factor, cofilin, to overcome this restriction. HIV envelope-mediated cofilin activation and actin dynamics are important for a postentry process that leads to viral nuclear localization. Inhibition of HIV-mediated actin rearrangement markedly diminishes viral latent infection of resting T cells. Conversely, induction of active cofilin greatly facilitates it. These findings shed light on viral exploitation of cellular machinery in resting T cells, where chemokine receptor signaling becomes obligatory.

15194790|a|The membrane fusion events which initiate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and promote cytopathic syncytium formation in infected cells commence with the binding of the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) to CD4 and an appropriate coreceptor. Here, we show that HIV Env-coreceptor interactions activate Rac-1 GTPase and stimulate the actin filament network reorganizations that are requisite components of the cell fusion process. Disrupting actin filament dynamics with jasplakinolide or latrunculin A arrested fusion at a late step in the formation of Env-CD4-coreceptor complexes. Time-lapse confocal microscopy of living cells revealed vigorous activity of actin-based, target cell membrane extensions at the target cell-Env-expressing cell interface. The expression of dominant-negative forms of actin-regulating Rho-family GTPases established that HIV Env-mediated syncytium formation relies on Rac-1 but not on Cdc42 or Rho activation in target cells. Similar dependencies were found when cell fusion was induced by Env expressed on viral or cellular membranes. Additionally, Rac activity was specifically upregulated in a coreceptor-dependent manner in fusion reaction cell lysates. These results define a role for HIV Env-coreceptor interactions in activating the cellular factors essential for virus-cell and cell-cell fusion and provide evidence for the participation of pertussis toxin-insensitive signaling pathways in HIV-induced membrane fusion.

18443296|a|Treatment for HIV has relied on the use of antiretroviral agents that can be subject to the development of resistant viruses. The study of inhibitors directed against cellular proteins required for HIV replication is therefore of growing interest. Inducible T cell kinase (ITK) is a Tec family tyrosine kinase that regulates T cell receptor (TCR)-induced activation of PLCgamma-1, Ca(2+) mobilization and transcription factor activation, and actin rearrangement downstream of both TCR and chemokine receptors. Because productive infection of T cells with HIV requires T cell activation, chemokine receptors and actin reorganization, we asked whether ITK affects HIV infection using ITK-specific siRNA, a kinase-inactive ITK mutant or an ITK inhibitor. We demonstrate that loss of ITK function resulted in marked reductions in intracellular p24 levels upon HIV infection. Loss of ITK function after establishment of HIV infection also decreased virus spread within the culture. Inhibition of ITK did not affect expression of the HIV coreceptors CD4 or CXCR4 but partially blocked HIV viral entry, an effect that correlated with decreased actin polarization to gp120. Additionally, ITK was required for efficient HIV transcription, and overexpression of ITK increased both viral transcription and virus-like particle formation. Our data suggest that inhibition of ITK blocks HIV infection by affecting multiple steps of HIV replication.

We have examined here the role of ZAP-70, a key kinase regulating T-cell activation and immunological synapse formation, in HIV replication. In lymphocytes deficient for ZAP-70, or expressing a kinase-dead mutant of the protein, HIV replication was strikingly delayed. We have characterized further this replication defect. ZAP-70 was dispensable for the early steps of viral cycle, from entry to expression of viral proteins. However, in the absence of ZAP-70, intracellular Gag localization was impaired. ZAP-70 was required in infected donor cells for efficient cell-to-cell HIV transmission to recipients and for formation of VSs. These results bring novel insights into the links that exist between T-cell activation and HIV spread, and suggest that HIV usurps components of the immunological synapse machinery to ensure its own spread through cell-to-cell contacts.

This study analyzed antiviral immune responses in mice deficient for Itk. Primary cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were analyzed after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), vaccinia virus (VV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Ex vivo CTL activity was consistently reduced by a factor of two to six for the different viruses. CTL responses after restimulation in vitro were similarly reduced unless exogenous cytokines were added. In the presence of interleukin-2 or concanavalin A supernatant, Itk-deficient and control mice responded similarly. Interestingly, while LCMV was completely eliminated by day 8 in both Itk-deficient and control mice, VV cleared from itk-/- mice with delayed kinetics. Antibody responses were evaluated after VSV infection. Both the T-cell-independent neutralizing immunoglobulin M (IgM) and the T-cell-dependent IgG responses were similar in Itk-deficient and control mice.

Both kinases are critically involved in lymphocyte development and signal transduction. In particular, Btk and Itk regulate calcium mobilization subsequent to antigen receptor stimulation. Small molecule antagonists that specifically inhibit either Btk or Itk may allow for selective modulation of B cell or T cell activity and may be useful in treating inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. We have developed a medium-throughput fluorescent imaging plate reader (FLIPR)- based calcium flux assay that can be used to assay potential Btk and Itk inhibitors. This assay takes advantage of Btk-deficient DT40 (DT40-Btk-/-) chicken B cells, which are unable to mobilize calcium in response to cross-linking of their B cell receptor (BCR). Ectopic expression of TEC family kinases can restore antigen receptor signaling in these cells. We have generated stable DT40-Btk-/- lines expressing either wild-type human Btk (huBtk) or a chimeric Btk-Itk kinase (huBtk-Itk) molecule-a Btk protein whose kinase domain has been replaced by the kinase domain of Itk. Expression of either huBtk or huBtk-Itk in DT40-Btk-/- cells restores calcium flux in response to BCR engagement. Using Btk- and Itk-selective inhibitors, we show that inhibition of calcium responses in huBtk-Itk-DT40-Btk-/- cells and huBtk-DT40-Btk-/- cells is dependent on the Itk or Btk kinase domain, respectively. Thus, the FLIPR assay described here can be used to assess, compare, and rank the potency and selectivity of inhibitors of Itk and Btk kinases.

The authors developed a set of 3 high-throughput screening (HTS)-compatible biochemical assays that can measure 3 mechanistically distinct properties of a kinase active site, with the goal that at least 1 of the 3 would be applicable to any kinase selected as a target for drug discovery efforts. Two assays measure catalytically active enzyme: A dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoroimmuno assay (DELFIA) uses an antibody to quantitate the generation of phosphorylated substrate; a second assay uses luciferase to measure the consumption of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during either phosphoryl-transfer to a peptide substrate or to water (intrinsic ATPase activity). A third assay, which is not dependent on a catalytically active enzyme, measures the competition for binding to kinase between an inhibitor and a fluorescent ATP binding site probe. To evaluate the suitability of these assays for drug discovery, the authors compared their ability to identify inhibitors of a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase from the Tec family, interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK). The 3 assays agreed on 57% of the combined confirmed hit set identified from screening a 10,208-compound library enriched with known kinase inhibitors and molecules that were structurally similar. Among the 3 assays, the one measuring intrinsic ATPase activity produced the largest number of unique hits, the fewest unique misses, and the most comprehensive hit set, missing only 2.7% of the confirmed inhibitors identified by the other 2 assays combined. Based on these data, all 3 assay formats are viable for screening and together provide greater options for assay design depending on the targeted kinase.

Reversing the amide linkage at C6 led to 16, with a fivefold improvement of potency. This enhancement is rationalized by the conformational preference of the substituent. A model for the binding of the benzimidazoles to the ATP-binding site of ITK is proposed.

16401422|a|The molecular reorganization of signaling molecules after T cell receptor (TCR) activation is accompanied by polymerization of actin at the site of contact between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC), as well as extension of actin-rich lamellipodia around the APC. Actin polymerization is critical for the fidelity and efficiency of the T cell response to antigen. The ability of T cells to polymerize actin is critical for several steps in T cell activation including TCR clustering, mature immunological synapse formation, calcium flux, IL-2 production, and proliferation. Activation of the Rac GTPase has been linked to regulation of actin polymerization after TCR stimulation. However, the molecules required for TCR-mediated actin polymerization downstream of activated Rac have remained elusive. Here we identify a novel role for the Abi/Wave protein complex, which signals downstream of activated Rac, in the regulation of actin polymerization and T cell activation in response to TCR stimulation.Here we show that Abi and Wave rapidly translocate from the T cell cytoplasm to the T cell:B cell contact site in the presence of antigen. Abi and Wave colocalize with actin at the T cell:B cell conjugation site. Moreover, Wave and Abi are necessary for actin polymerization after T cell activation, and loss of Abi proteins in mice impairs TCR-induced cell proliferation and IL-2 production in primary T cells. Significantly, the impairment in actin polymerization in cells lacking Abi proteins is due to the inability of Wave proteins to localize to the T cell:B cell contact site in the presence of antigen, rather than the destabilization of the components of the Wave protein complex.The Abi/Wave complex is a novel regulator of TCR-mediated actin dynamics, IL-2 production, and proliferation.

18305217|a|Actin dynamics during T-cell activation are controlled by the coordinate action of multiple actin regulatory proteins, functioning downstream of a complex network of kinases and other signaling molecules. The c-Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase regulates actin responses in nonhematopoietic cells, but its function in T cells is poorly understood. Using kinase inhibitors, RNAi, and conditional knockout mice, we investigated the role of c-Abl in controlling the T-cell actin response. We find that c-Abl is required for normal actin polymerization and lamellipodial spreading at the immune synapse, and for downstream events leading to efficient interleukin-2 production. c-Abl also plays a key role in signaling chemokine-induced T-cell migration. c-Abl is required for the appropriate function of 2 proteins known to be important for controlling actin responses to T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement, the actin-stabilizing adapter protein HS1, and the Rac1-dependent actin polymerizing protein WAVE2. c-Abl binds to phospho-HS1 via its SH2 domains and is required for full tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 during T-cell activation. In addition, c-Abl is required for normal localization of WAVE2 to the immune synapse (IS). These studies identify c-Abl as a key player in the signaling cascade, leading to actin reorganization during T-cell activation.

13679030|a|STI-571 (imatinib, Gleevec, Glivec, CGP 57148) is an inhibitor of the Abl group of protein-tyrosine kinases. One of these enzymes, the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, results from the fusion of the BCR and ABL genes that result from the reciprocal chromosomal translocation that forms the Philadelphia chromosome. The Philadelphia chromosome occurs in 95% of people with chronic myeloid leukemia. ABL is the cellular homologue of the oncogene found in murine Abelson leukemia virus, and BCR refers to breakpoint cluster region. The Bcr-Abl oncoprotein exhibits elevated protein-tyrosine kinase activity, which is strongly implicated in the mechanism of development of chronic myeloid leukemia. STI-571 is effective in the treatment of the stable phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. The c-Abl protein kinase domain exists in an active and inactive conformation. STI-571 binds only to the inactive state of the enzyme as shown by X-ray crystallography. The drug binds to a portion of the ATP-binding site and extends from there into adjacent hydrophobic regions. STI-571 is a competitive inhibitor of Abl kinase with respect to ATP. Resistance to STI-571 is often the result of mutations in residues of the Bcr-Abl kinase that ordinarily bind to the drug. Inhibition of target protein kinases represents an emerging therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer.

15331406|a|Chemokines and cytokines play a critical role in HIV infection, serving both to modulate virus replication and to recruit target cells to the site of infection. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a mitogen and chemoattractant for a wide variety of cells, is secreted by macrophages. Since macrophages are the target cells for lentiviral infection in the brain and PDGF is a known inducer of macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP)-1, a potent chemokine closely associated with HIV encephalitis, we investigated the association of PDGF-B chain (PDGF-B) with encephalitis in macaques caused by simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), a chimera of HIV and SIV. Northern blot analysis confirmed elevated expression of PDGF-B chain mRNA in the brains from encephalitic macaques. Validation of these in vivo studies was confirmed in rhesus macrophage cultures infected with SHIV(KU2) in which we demonstrated heightened expression of PDGF-B chain mRNA. Nuclear run-off analysis established transcriptional up-regulation of PDGF-B chain in virus-inoculated macrophage cultures. Reciprocally, addition of exogenous PDGF enhanced virus replication and MCP-1 expression in these cells. Inhibition of virus replication by tyrosine kinase inhibitor, STI-571, and by PDGF-B antisense oligonucleotides confirmed the specificity of the PDGF effect. Relevance of these findings was confirmed by analysis of archival brain tissue from SHIV encephalitic and non-encephalitic macaques for PDGF-B chain expression. PDGF-B chain protein expression was observed in the virus-infected cells in microglial nodules in the brains of SHIV-encephalitic macaques.

11015440|a|Tec family kinases are implicated in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, and combined mutation of inducible T cell kinase (Itk) and resting lymphocyte kinase (Rlk)/Txk in mice dramatically impairs mature T cell function. Nonetheless, mutation of these kinases still permits T cell development. While itk(-)(/)- mice exhibit mild reductions in T cells with decreased CD4/CD8 cell ratios, rlk(-)(/)-itk(-)(/)- mice have improved total T cell numbers yet maintain decreased CD4/CD8 ratios. Using TCR transgenics and an in vitro thymocyte deletion model, we demonstrate that mutation of Tec kinases causes graded defects in thymocyte selection, leading to a switch from negative to positive selection in rlk(-)(/)-itk(-)(/)- animals. The reduction in both positive and negative selection and decreased CD4/CD8 ratios correlates with decreased biochemical parameters of TCR signaling, specifically defects in capacitive Ca(2+) influx and activation of the mitogen-activated kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2. Thus, Tec kinases influence cell fate determination by modulating TCR signaling, leading to altered thresholds for thymocyte selection. These results provide support for a quantitative model for thymic development and provide evidence that defects in negative selection can substantially alter thymic cellularity.

12055226|a|The Tec family tyrosine kinase Itk is critical for efficient signaling downstream of the TCR. Biochemically, Itk is directly phosphorylated and activated by Lck. Subsequently, Itk activates phospholipase C-gamma1, leading to calcium mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. These observations suggested that Itk might play an important role in positive selection and CD4/CD8 lineage commitment during T cell development in the thymus. To test this, we crossed Itk-deficient mice to three lines of TCR transgenics and analyzed progeny on three different MHC backgrounds. Analysis of these mice revealed that fewer TCR transgenic T cells develop in the absence of Itk. In addition, examination of multiple T cell development markers indicates that multiple stages of positive selection are affected by the absence of Itk, but the T cells that do develop appear normal. In contrast to the defects in positive selection, CD4/CD8 lineage commitment seems to be intact in all the TCR transgenic itk(-/-) lines tested. Overall, these data indicate that altering TCR signals by the removal of Itk does not affect the appropriate differentiation of thymocytes based on their MHC specificity, but does impact the efficiency with which thymocytes complete their maturation process.

The activity of these kinases in T cells has been shown to be important for the full activation of phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1). Disruption of Tec family signaling in Itk-/- and Rlk-/-Itk-/- mice has multiple effects on T cell development, cytokine production and T-helper cell differentiation. Furthermore, mice possessing mutations in signaling molecules upstream of PLC-gamma1, such as Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and Vav1, or in members of the nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, which are downstream of PLC-gamma1, have been found to have similar phenotypes to Tec family-deficient mice, emphasizing the importance of this pathway in regulating T cell activation, differentiation and homeostasis.

10760794|a|Considerable evidence suggests that the ERK pathway is required for positive but not negative thymocyte selection. Here, we report that ERK is highly activated in double-positive (DP) thymocytes expressing an MHC class I-restricted TCR (P14) in response to negatively selecting conditions, whereas ligands that trigger positive selection induced weaker ERK activation. Biochemical evidence also shows that death by neglect is associated with a further reduction in ERK activation. These findings are consistent with the affinity / avidity model of thymocyte selection. To further examine the role of ERK in negative selection we used the MEK-1 inhitibor, PD98059, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of the ERK pathway. Biochemical data demonstrated a reduction of ERK activity by PD98059 in the presence of the negatively selecting ligand. Analysis of P14 TCR-transgenic fetal thymic lobes cultured with PD98059 under negatively selecting conditions showed impaired clonal deletion of DP thymocytes and a concomitant increase in positive selection of functional mature, TCR(hi) transgenic T cells. This demonstrates that altering ERK activity switched negative to positive selection. Contrary to previous reports that show an exclusive role for ERK signaling in positive selection, our data demonstrate that negative selection is also sensitive to the degree of ERK activation.

16174747|a|It is unknown how the contrasting events of positive and negative selection can lead to the distinct biological outcomes of life or death. An increasing body of evidence suggests that the duration of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling plays a role in thymocyte selection. However, it remains unclear what the kinetics of ERK activation are during positive selection in vivo. In this study, we examined the magnitude and duration of ERK signaling in intact murine thymic tissues cultured under conditions of negative or positive selection. We found that negative selection induced a rapid and robust ERK activation that is associated with death, whereas positive selection stimulated a lower intensity and brief ERK activation that quickly declined and then gradually increased and was sustained over several days. The expression pattern of Egr-1 (early growth response-1), a downstream ERK effector, correlates with the biphasic kinetics of ERK during positive selection. Id3 (inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding 3) also exhibits biphasic kinetics but appeared to be independent of ERK signaling. Furthermore, inhibitors of T cell receptor ligation and ERK activation block maturation of CD8 single-positive thymocytes even when added after 24 h. These results demonstrate that the in vivo duration of ERK signaling must be sustained to support positive selection.

11323693|a|Pre-T cell antigen receptor (pre-TCR) signaling plays a crucial role in the development of immature T cells. Although certain aspects of proximal pre-TCR signaling have been studied, the intermediate signal transducers and the distal transcription modulators have been poorly characterized. We report here a correlation between pre-TCR signaling and a biphasic rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. In addition, we show that constitutive pre-TCR signaling is associated with an increased rate of Ca2+ influx through store-operated plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. We show also that the biphasic nature of the observed pre-TCR-induced rise in cytosolic Ca2+ differentially modulates the activities of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and NFAT in developing T cells.

18025201|a|alphabeta T cell development in the thymus is dependent on signaling through the TCR. The first of these signals is mediated by the pre-TCR, which is responsible for promoting pre-T cell proliferation and the differentiation of CD4(-)8(-)3(-) (DN) thymocytes into CD4(+)8(+)3(+) (DP) cells. In many cases, T cell signaling proteins known to be essential for TCR signaling in mature T cells are also required for pre-TCR signaling in DN thymocytes. Therefore, it came as a surprise to discover that mice lacking the Tec kinases Itk and Rlk, enzymes required for efficient activation of phospholipase C-gamma1 in mature T cells, showed no obvious defects in pre-TCR-dependent selection events in the thymus. In this report, we demonstrate that DN thymocytes lacking Itk, or Itk and Rlk, are impaired in their ability to generate normal numbers of DP thymocytes, especially when placed in direct competition with WT DN thymocytes. We also show that Itk is required for maximal pre-TCR signaling in DN thymocytes. These data demonstrate that the Tec kinases Itk and Rlk are involved in, but are not essential for, pre-TCR signaling in the thymus, suggesting that there is an alternative mechanism for activating phospholipase C-gamma1 in DN thymocytes that is not operating in DP thymocytes and mature T cells.

12033737|a|Cell-fate decisions are controlled typically by conserved receptors that interact with co-evolved ligands. Therefore, the lineage-specific differentiation of immature CD4+ CD8+ T cells into CD4+ or CD8+ mature T cells is unusual in that it is regulated by clonally expressed, somatically generated T-cell receptors (TCRs) of unpredictable fine specificity. Yet, each mature T cell generally retains expression of the co-receptor molecule (CD4 or CD8) that has an MHC-binding property that matches that of its TCR. Two models were proposed initially to explain this remarkable outcome--'instruction' of lineage choice by initial signalling events or 'selection' after a stochastic fate decision that limits further development to cells with coordinated TCR and co-receptor specificities. Aspects of both models now appear to be correct; mistake-prone instruction of lineage choice precedes a subsequent selection step that filters out most incorrect decisions.

Itk(-/-) and Rlk(-/-)Itk(-/-) CD8(+) thymocytes and T cells were CD44(hi), CD122(+), and NK1.1(+); were able to produce interferon-gamma directly ex vivo; and were dependent on interleukin-15. Itk(-/-) and Rlk(-/-)Itk(-/-) CD8(+) thymocytes expressed abundant transcripts for the T box transcription factor, eomesodermin, correlating with their phenotype and function.

Itk(-/-) and Rlk(-/-)Itk(-/-) mice also have decreased CD4:8 T cell ratios, suggestive of altered CD4:8 lineage commitment. Nonetheless, we find that CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes and peripheral CD8(+) T cells in these mice do not resemble conventional CD8(+) T cells. Instead, these cells express memory markers, rapidly produce interferon-gamma, and can be selected on hematopoietically derived cells, similar to MHC class Ib-restricted "innate-type" lymphocytes. Itk deficiency also greatly increases the number of cells selected by MHC class Ib. Expression of a hypersensitive Erk2 mutant partially corrects the CD8(+) T cell phenotypes in Itk(-/-) mice, arguing that altered signaling permits development of this innate-type CD8(+) cell population. Our results suggest that Tec kinases differentially regulate development of conventional versus nonconventional lymphocytes.

16880398|a|CD8(+) T cells are commonly divided into naïve CD44(lo)CD122(lo) and "memory phenotype" CD44(hi)CD122(hi) cells. Here we show data suggesting that these two cell populations represent independent CD8(+) T cell subsets. Whereas IL-15(-/-) mice lack CD44(hi)CD122(hi) CD8(+) T cells, mice deficient in the kinase ITK lack CD44(lo)CD122(lo) cells among CD8(+) T cells. The same defects were observed during thymus development. CD44(hi)CD122(hi) cells were found among double-positive thymocytes and increased in frequency during CD8 development in wild-type mice. At the mature stage, IL-15(-/-) mice harbored virtually no CD44(hi)CD122(hi) CD8(+) thymocytes. In contrast, ITK(-/-) mice lacked CD44(lo)CD122(lo) CD8(+) cells at this stage. We generated mice with genetic deletions in both IL-15 and ITK and observed a severe reduction of all CD8(+) T cells. The two CD44(lo)CD122(lo) and CD44(hi)CD122(hi) CD8(+) T cell subsets differed in the periphery in that natural killer (NK) receptor expression was found only on CD44(hi)CD122(hi) CD8(+) T cells. This expression was paralleled by their ability to respond to both T cell receptor and NK receptor engagements. In contrast, CD44(lo)CD122(lo) CD8(+) T cells mounted stronger responses to T cell receptor stimulation but failed to recognize NK receptor ligands. Thus, whereas ITK-dependent CD44(lo)CD122(lo) CD8(+) T cells appear to represent conventional CD8(+) T cells, IL-15-dependent CD44(hi)CD122(hi) CD8(+) T cells may have functions in both adaptive and innate immunity.

17724684|a|T cells with a memory-like phenotype and possessing innate immune function have been previously identified as CD8(+)CD44(hi) cells. These cells rapidly secrete IFN-gamma upon stimulation with IL-12/IL-18 and are involved in innate responses to infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The signals regulating these cells are unclear. The Tec kinase Itk regulates T cell activation and we report here that a majority of the CD8(+) T cells in Itk null mice have a phenotype of CD44(hi) similar to memory-like innate T cells. These cells are observed in mice carrying an Itk mutant lacking the kinase domain, indicating that active Tec kinase signaling suppresses their presence. These cells carry preformed message for and are able to rapidly produce IFN-gamma upon stimulation in vitro with IL-12/IL-18, and endow Itk null mice the ability to effectively respond to infection with L. monocytogenes or exposure to lipopolysaccharides by secretion of IFN-gamma. Transfer of these cells rescues the ability of IFN-gamma null mice to reduce bacterial burden following L. monocytogenes infection, indicating that these cells are functional CD8(+)CD44(hi) T cells previously detected in vivo. These results indicate that active signals from Tec kinases regulate the development of memory-like CD8(+) T cells with innate function.

Like NKT cells, these CD8(+) T cells can be selected on hematopoietic cells. We demonstrate that these CD8(+) T cell phenotypes resulted from selection on hematopoietic cells-forcing selection on the thymic stroma reduced the number and innate phenotypes of mature Itk-deficient CD8(+) T cells. We further show that, similar to NKT cells, selection of innate-type CD8(+) T cells in Itk(-/-) mice required the adaptor SAP. Acquisition of their innate characteristics, however, required CD28. Our results suggest that SAP and Itk reciprocally regulate selection of innate and conventional CD8(+) T cells on hematopoietic cells and thymic epithelium, respectively, whereas CD28 regulates development of innate phenotypes resulting from selection on hematopoietic cells.

Moreover, T-bet and eomesodermin were responsible for inducing enhanced expression of CD122, the receptor specifying interleukin 15 responsiveness. Therefore, these key transcription factors link the long-term renewal of memory CD8(+) T cells to their characteristic effector potency.

17150027|a|Recognized more than a decade ago, NKT cells differentiate from mainstream thymic precursors through instructive signals emanating during TCR engagement by CD1d-expressing cortical thymocytes. Their semi-invariant alphabeta TCRs recognize isoglobotrihexosylceramide, a mammalian glycosphingolipid, as well as microbial alpha-glycuronylceramides found in the cell wall of Gram-negative, lipopolysaccharide-negative bacteria. This dual recognition of self and microbial ligands underlies innate-like antimicrobial functions mediated by CD40L induction and massive Th1 and Th2 cytokine and chemokine release. Through reciprocal activation of NKT cells and dendritic cells, synthetic NKT ligands constitute promising new vaccine adjuvants. NKT cells also regulate a range of immunopathological conditions, but the mechanisms and the ligands involved remain unknown. NKT cell biology has emerged as a new field of research at the frontier between innate and adaptive immunity, providing a powerful model to study fundamental aspects of the cell and structural biology of glycolipid trafficking, processing, and recognition.

12089507|a|Unlike conventional CD8(+) T cells, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib-restricted CD8(+) T cells show an activated phenotype in uninfected mice and respond rapidly to foreign invaders. The underlying factors that contribute to these differences are not well understood. We show here that the activated phenotype of MHC class Ib-restricted CD8(+) T cells was partially acquired as a result of interactions in the thymus and reflected an increased capacity to be selected via interactions with MHC molecules on hematopoietic cells. Using bone marrow-chimeric mice, we have shown that MHC class Ib-restricted, but not MHC class Ia-restricted, CD8(+) T cells specific for Listeria monocytogenes were efficiently selected when MHC class I was expressed only on hematopoietic cells. Thus, the distinct functional properties of MHC class Ib-restricted versus MHC class Ia-restricted CD8(+) T cells may result, at least in part, from the different ways in which they are positively selected in the thymus.

16226504|a|Despite numerous reports on MHC class II expression by T cells from a wide spectrum of mammalian species including humans, the biological relevance of this phenomenon has never been tested with appropriately designed animal models. To address this issue, we developed mouse models in which immature thymocytes are the only positively selecting antigen-presenting cells in the thymus. In these mice, CD4+ T cells were generated with the appropriate maturation phenotype and showed a diverse repertoire of TCR Vbetas. The CD4+ T cells were functionally competent, mediating effective allogeneic responses that involved polyclonal TCR Vbetas. These results suggest that the thymocyte-thymocyte (T-T) interaction operates as an independent pathway for CD4+ T cell selection in the thymi of species with MHC II-positive thymocytes. This T-T interaction appears to be the basis for the generation of donor MHC-restricted CD4+ T cells in xenogeneic hosts.

16226503|a|Conventional understanding of CD4 T cell development is that the MHC class II molecules on cortical thymic epithelial cell are necessary for positive selection, as demonstrated in mouse models. Clinical data, however, show that hematopoietic stem cells reconstitute CD4 T cells in patients devoid of MHC class II. Additionally, CD4 T cells generated from human stem cells in immunocompromised mice were restricted to human, but not mouse, MHC class II. These studies suggest an alternative pathway for CD4 T cell development that does not normally exist in mice. MHC class II is expressed on developing human thymocytes, indicating a possible role of MHC II on thymocytes for CD4 T cell generation. Therefore, we created mice in which MHC class II is expressed only on T lineage cells. Remarkably, the CD4 compartment in such mice is efficiently reconstituted with unique specificity, demonstrating a novel thymocyte-driven pathway of CD4 T cell selection.

17579028|a|NKT cells rapidly secrete cytokines upon TCR stimulation and thus may modulate the acquired immune response. Recent studies suggest that signaling for development and effector function in NKT cells may differ from conventional T cells. The tyrosine kinase Itk is activated downstream of the TCR, and its absence in CD4(+) T cells results in impaired Th2, but not Th1 responses. In this study, we investigated NKT cell function in the absence of Itk as impaired type 2 responses in vivo could be manifest through IL-4 defects in a number of cell types. We show that Itk-deficient NKT cells up-regulate IL-4 mRNA in the thymus and express constitutive IL-4 and IFN-gamma transcripts in peripheral organs. Thus, Itk is not required for the developmental activation of cytokine loci in NKT cells. Nevertheless, Itk-deficient NKT cells are severely impaired in IL-4 protein production. Strikingly, unlike conventional CD4(+) T cells, Itk-deficient NKT cells also have profound defects in IFN-gamma production. Furthermore, both IL-4 and IFN-gamma production were markedly impaired following in vivo challenge with alpha-galactosyl ceramide. Function can be restored in Itk-deficient NKT cells by provision of calcium signals using ionomycin. These results suggest that NKT cells are highly dependent on Itk for IL-4- and IFN-gamma-mediated effector function. Thus, the pattern of cytokine genes that are affected by Itk deficiency appears to be cell lineage-specific, likely reflecting differences in activation threshold between immune effectors. The severe defect in NKT cell function may underlie a number of the Th1 and Th2 immune defects in Itk-deficient mice.

18292523|a|The Tec kinases Itk and Rlk are required for efficient positive selection of conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the thymus. In contrast, recent studies have shown that these Tec kinases are dispensable for the development of CD8+ T cells with characteristics of innate T cells. These findings raise questions about the potential role of Itk and Rlk in NKT cell development, because NKT cells represent a subset of innate T cells. To address this issue, we examined invariant NKT cells in Itk-/- and Itk/Rlk-/- mice. We find, as has been reported previously, that Itk-/- mice have reduced numbers of NKT cells with a predominantly immature phenotype. We further show that this defect is greatly exacerbated in the absence of both Itk and Rlk, leading to a 7-fold reduction in invariant NKT cell numbers in the thymus of Itk/Rlk-/- mice and a more severe block in NKT cell maturation. Splenic Itk-/- and Itk/Rlk-/- NKT cells are also functionally defective, because they produce little to no cytokine following in vivo activation. Tec kinase-deficient NKT cells also show enhanced cell death in the spleen. These defects correlate with greatly diminished expression of CD122, the IL-2R/IL-15R beta-chain, and impaired expression of the T-box transcription factor, T-bet. These data indicate that the Tec kinases Itk and Rlk provide important signals for terminal maturation, efficient cytokine production, and peripheral survival of NKT cells.

12193707|a|NK T cells are a lymphocyte lineage that is selected by CD1d and is characterized by the ability to rapidly secrete large amounts of both IFN-gamma and IL-4 after TCR stimulation. Using reactivity to CD1d tetramers to define presumptive NK T cells, several NK T cell progenitor populations were characterized based upon NK marker expression and CD4 vs CD8 expression. The earliest populations were found to be negative for NK markers and could proliferate to IL-7, while mature NK T cells did not. The NK1.1(-) NK T cell progenitors were capable of up-regulating NK1.1 when transferred in vivo. Upon stimulation, the NK1.1(-) populations secrete IL-4, but little IFN-gamma. As the cells mature and up-regulate NK1.1, they acquire the ability to secrete IFN-gamma. Finally, the Tec family tyrosine kinase Itk is necessary for optimal NK1.1 up-regulation and hence final maturation of NK T cells. The itk(-/-) mice also display a progressive decrease in NK T cells in older animals, suggesting a further role in peripheral maintenance.

Classical class Ia molecules therefore ensure most but not all of the peripheral CD8+ T cell repertoire education. As expected, H2Kb but also H2Db KO mice developed choriomeningitis following intracranial infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus with the same kinetics, lethality and CD8+ cell implication as wild-type B6 mice. By contrast, H2KbDb (class Ia-Ib+) KO mice survived. Choriomeningitis of H2Db KO mice was linked to the development of a subdominant (in normal B6 mice) H2Kb-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte response.

18501771|a|The nine SLAM-family genes, SLAMF1-9, a subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily, encode differentially expressed cell-surface receptors of hematopoietic cells. Engagement with their ligands, which are predominantly homotypic, leads to distinct signal transduction events, for instance those that occur in the T or NK cell immune synapse. Upon phosphorylation of one or more copies of a unique tyrosine-based signaling motif in their cytoplasmic tails, six of the SLAM receptors recruit the highly specific single SH2-domain adapters SLAM-associated protein (SAP), EAT-2A, and/or EAT-2B. These adapters in turn bind to the tyrosine kinase Fyn and/or other protein tyrosine kinases connecting the receptors to signal transduction networks. Individuals deficient in the SAP gene, SH2D1A, develop an immunodeficiency syndrome: X-linked lympho-proliferative disease. In addition to operating in the immune synapse, SLAM receptors initiate or partake in multiple effector functions of hematopoietic cells, for example, neutrophil and macrophage killing and platelet aggregation. Here we discuss the current understanding of the structure and function of these recently discovered receptors and adapter molecules in the regulation of adaptive and innate immune responses.

15539155|a|XLP is caused by mutations affecting SAP, an adaptor that recruits Fyn to SLAM family receptors. SAP-deficient mice recapitulate features of XLP, including increased T cell activation and decreased humoral responses post-infection. SAP-deficient T cells also show increased TCR-induced IFN-gamma and decreased T(H)2 cytokine production. We demonstrate that the defect in IL-4 secretion in SAP-deficient T cells is independent of increased IFN-gamma production. SAP-deficient cells respond normally to polarizing cytokines, yet show impaired TCR-mediated induction of GATA-3 and IL-4. Examination of TCR signaling revealed normal Ca(2+) mobilization and ERK activation in SAP-deficient cells, but decreased PKC-theta recruitment, Bcl-10 phosphorylation, IkappaB-alpha degradation, and nuclear NF-kappaB1/p50 levels. Similar defects were observed in Fyn-deficient cells. SLAM engagement amplified PKC-theta recruitment in wt but not SAP- or Fyn-deficient cells, arguing that a SAP/Fyn-mediated pathway enhances PKC-theta/NF-kappaB1 activation and suggesting a role for this pathway in T(H)2 regulation.

During the past eight years, it has been established that the SLAM family of cell surface receptors (SLAM, 2B4, NTB-A, Ly9, CD84) and the SAP family of adaptors (SAP, EAT-2, ERT) play critical roles in lymphocyte development, differentiation, and acquisition of effector functions. Studies of these proteins have shown unexpected roles in cytokine production by T cells and myeloid cells, T cell-dependent humoral immune responses, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and NKT cell development. This review highlights recent findings that have improved our understanding of the roles of the SLAM and SAP families of molecules in immune regulation and discusses how perturbations in the signaling pathways involving these proteins can result in different disease states.

15749842|a|X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) is a fatal immunological disorder that typically manifests following EBV infection. XLP patients exhibit a number of immune defects including abnormal T, B, and NK lymphocyte function. These defects have been attributed to mutations of Src homology 2 domain-containing gene 1A (SH2D1A), the gene encoding signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein (SAP), an intracellular adaptor molecule expressed in lymphocytes. We have observed that SAP knockout (SAPKO) mice and humans with XLP have a complete lack of CD1d-restricted NKT cells. As expected, SAPKO mice injected with the NKT cell agonist, alpha-galactosylceramide failed to generate NKT cell IFN-gamma or IL-4. Furthermore, in contrast to wild-type littermates, SAPKO mice coinjected with OVA and alpha-galactosylceramide failed to mount OVA-specific CTL responses. These data suggest that an absence of NKT cells may underlie part of the immune dysregulation seen in SAPKO mice and in XLP patients.

15711562|a|The adaptor molecule SAP is expressed in T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, where it regulates cytokine production and cytotoxicity. Here, we show that SAP, encoded by the SH2D1A gene locus, also has a crucial role during the development of NKT cells, a lymphocyte subset with immunoregulatory functions in response to infection, cancer and autoimmune disease. Following stimulation with the NKT cell-specific agonist alpha-galactosyl ceramide (alphaGC), Sh2d1a-/- splenocytes did not produce cytokines or activate other lymphoid lineages in an NKT cell-dependent manner. While evaluating the abnormalities in alphaGC-induced immune responses, we observed that Sh2d1a-/- animals lacked NKT cells in the thymus and peripheral organs. The defect in NKT cell ontogeny was hematopoietic cell autonomous and could be rescued by reconstitution of SAP expression within Sh2d1a-/- bone marrow cells. Seventeen individuals with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP), who harbored germline mutations in SH2D1A, also lacked NKT cells. Furthermore, a female XLP carrier showed completely skewed X chromosome inactivation within NKT cells, but not T or B cells. Thus, SAP is a crucial regulator of NKT cell ontogeny in humans and in mice. The absence of NKT cells may contribute to the phenotypes of SAP deficiency, including abnormal antiviral and antitumor immunity and hypogammaglobulinemia.

It plays a critical role in immunity, as it is mutated in humans with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP), a fatal immunodeficiency characterized by an abnormal response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. SAP interacts with the SLAM family receptors and promotes transduction signal events by these receptors through its capacity to recruit and activate the Src kinase FynT. Because it has been previously established that FynT is selectively required for the development of NKT cells, we examined NKT cells in SAP-deficient mice and in humans with XLP. In the absence of SAP, the development of NKT cells is severely impaired both in mice and in humans. These results imply that SAP is a potent regulator of NKT cell development. They also identify for the first time a defect in NKT cells associated with a human primary immunodeficiency, revealing a potential role of NKT cells in the immune response to EBV.

17080092|a|The homeostasis of the immune response requires tight regulation of the proliferation and apoptosis of activated lymphocytes. In humans, defects in immune homeostasis result in lymphoproliferation disorders including autoimmunity, haemophagocytic lymphohystiocytosis and lymphomas. The X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) is a rare, inherited immunodeficiency that is characterized by lymphohystiocytosis, hypogammaglobulinaemia and lymphomas, and that usually develops in response to infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Mutations in the signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein SAP, a signalling adaptor molecule, underlie 60% of cases of familial XLP. Here, we identify mutations in the gene that encodes the X-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis XIAP (also termed BIRC4) in patients with XLP from three families without mutations in SAP. These mutations lead to defective expression of XIAP. We show that apoptosis of lymphocytes from XIAP-deficient patients is enhanced in response to various stimuli including the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex, the death receptor CD95 (also termed Fas or Apo-1) and the TNF-associated apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R). We also found that XIAP-deficient patients, like SAP-deficient patients, have low numbers of natural killer T-lymphocytes (NKT cells), indicating that XIAP is required for the survival and/or differentiation of NKT cells. The observation that XIAP-deficiency and SAP-deficiency are both associated with a defect in NKT cells strengthens the hypothesis that NKT cells have a key role in the immune response to EBV. Furthermore, by identifying an XLP immunodeficiency that is caused by mutations in XIAP, we show that XIAP is a potent regulator of lymphocyte homeostasis in vivo.

18031695|a|Commitment to the T and natural killer T (NKT) cell lineages is determined during alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated interactions of common precursors with ligand-expressing cells in the thymus. Whereas mainstream thymocyte precursors recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ligands expressed by stromal cells, NKT cell precursors interact with CD1d ligands expressed by cortical thymocytes. Here, we demonstrated that such homotypic T-T interactions generated "second signals" mediated by the cooperative engagement of the homophilic receptors Slamf1 (SLAM) and Slamf6 (Ly108) and the downstream recruitment of the adaptor SLAM-associated protein (SAP) and the Src kinase Fyn, which are essential for the lineage expansion and differentiation of the NKT cell lineage. These receptor interactions were required during TCR engagement and therefore only occurred when selecting ligands were presented by thymocytes rather than epithelial cells, which do not express Slamf6 or Slamf1. Thus, the topography of NKT cell ligand recognition determines the availability of a cosignaling pathway that is essential for NKT cell lineage development.

18660811|a|Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) have an innate immunity-like rapidity of response and the ability to modulate the effector functions of other cells. We show here that iNKT cells specifically expressed the BTB-zinc finger transcriptional regulator PLZF. In the absence of PLZF, iNKT cells developed, but they lacked many features of innate T cells. PLZF-deficient iNKT cells accumulated in lymph nodes rather than in the liver, did not express NK markers and did not have the characteristic activated phenotype. PLZF-deficient iNKT cells failed to secrete large amounts of interleukin 4 and interferon-gamma after activation; however, some cells produced either interleukin 4 or interferon-gamma but not both. PLZF, therefore, is an iNKT cell-specific transcription factor that is necessary for full functionality.

19004789|a|Transcriptional pathways controlling the development of CD44(hi) memory phenotype (MP) T cells with "innate-like" functions are not well understood. Here we show that the BTB (bric-a-brac, tramtrack, broad complex) domain-containing protein promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is expressed in CD44(hi), but not in CD44(lo), CD4(+) T cells. Transgenic expression of PLZF during T cell development and in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells induced a T cell intrinsic program leading to an increase in peripheral CD44(hi) MP CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and a corresponding decrease of naïve CD44(lo) T cells. The MP CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells produced IFNgamma upon PMA/ionomycin stimulation, thus showing innate-like function. Changes in the naïve versus memory-like subset distribution were already evident in single-positive thymocytes, indicating PLZF-induced T cell developmental alterations. In addition, CD1d-restricted natural killer T cells in PLZF transgenic mice showed impaired development and were severely reduced in the periphery. Finally, after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, CD4(+) transgenic T cells showed reduced IL-2 and IFNgamma production but increased IL-4 secretion as a result of enhanced IL-4 production of the CD44(hi)CD62L(+) subset. Our data indicate that PLZF is a novel regulator of the development of CD44(hi) MP T cells with a characteristic partial innate-like phenotype.

18703361|a|The transcriptional control of CD1d-restricted NKT cell development has remained elusive. We report that PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger, Zbtb16), a member of the BTB/POZ-ZF family of transcription factors that includes the CD4-lineage-specific c-Krox (Th-POK), is exquisitely specific to CD1d-restricted NKT cells and human MR1-specific MAIT cells. PLZF was induced immediately after positive selection of NKT cell precursors, and PLZF-deficient NKT cells failed to undergo the intrathymic expansion and effector differentiation that characterize their lineage. Instead, they preserved a naive phenotype and were directed to lymph nodes. Conversely, transgenic expression of PLZF induced CD4(+) thymocytes to acquire effector differentiation and migrate to nonlymphoid tissues. We suggest that PLZF is a transcriptional signature of NKT cells that directs their innate-like effector differentiation during thymic development.

18342008|a|The adaptor protein SLP76 directs signaling downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR) and is essential for thymocyte development. SLP76 contains three N-terminal tyrosines that are critical for its function. To define the role of these residues in thymocyte development, we generated two lines of "knock-in" mice, one expressing a mutation in tyrosine 145 (Y145F) and a second harboring two point mutations at tyrosines 112 and 128 (Y112-128F). We show here that although thymocyte development requires both Y145- and Y112-128-generated signals, selection was more dependent upon Y145. Although several proximal TCR signaling events were defective in both mutant mice, phosphorylation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Vav1, and activation of Itk-dependent pathways were differentially affected by mutations at Y112-128 and Y145, respectively. Analysis of mice expressing one Y145F and one Y112-128F allele revealed that these mutants could complement one another in trans, demonstrating cooperativity between two or more SLP76 molecules. Thus, the N-terminal tyrosines of SLP76 are required for thymocyte selection but can function on separate molecules to support TCR signaling.

18482989|a|The signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family of receptors has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autoimmunity in humans and mice. One member of the family, Ly108, was strongly linked to lupus susceptibility in mice. High expression of a Ly108 isoform, Ly108-1, was observed in lymphocytes of lupus-prone mice. Herein, we examined the molecular basis for the influence of Ly108 on lupus susceptibility by studying Ly108 signal transduction in T cells. We observed that Ly108 was able to mediate a tyrosine phosphorylation signal implicating Ly108, Vav-1, and c-Cbl in a manner strictly dependent on engagement of the extracellular domain of Ly108 and co-expression of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing adaptor signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP). Evaluation of T cells from mice carrying mutations in the SAP-FynT pathway indicated that Ly108-triggered protein tyrosine phosphorylation was due to the capacity of SAP to recruit FynT. Importantly, Ly108-1 was more apt at triggering tyrosine phosphorylation signals in T cells when compared with the predominant Ly108 isoform found in non-lupus-prone mice, Ly108-2. This difference was due in part to the presence in Ly108-1 of a unique intra-cytoplasmic tyrosine-based motif that promoted Ly108 signal transduction. Together these data provided a molecular explanation for the involvement of Ly108 in lupus susceptibility in mice.

12529646|a|Long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells are the primary cellular components of long-term humoral immunity and as such are vitally important for the protection afforded by most vaccines. The SAP gene has been identified as the genetic locus responsible for X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, a fatal immunodeficiency. Mutations in SAP have also been identified in some cases of severe common variable immunodeficiency disease. The underlying cellular basis of this genetic disorder remains unclear. We have used a SAP knockout mouse model system to explore the role of SAP in immune responses. Here we report that mice lacking expression of SAP generate strong acute IgG antibody responses after viral infection, but show a near complete absence of virus-specific long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells, despite the presence of virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells. Adoptive transfer experiments show that SAP-deficient B cells are normal and the defect is in CD4+ T cells. Thus, SAP has a crucial role in CD4+ T-cell function: it is essential for late B-cell help and the development of long-term humoral immunity but is not required for early B-cell help and class switching.

15263031|a|The signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM)/CD150 family includes a family of chromosome 1-encoded cell surface molecules with costimulatory functions mediated in part by the adaptor protein SH2D1A (SLAM-associated protein, SAP). Deficiency in SH2D1A protects mice from an experimental model of lupus, including the development of hypergammaglobulinemia, autoantibodies including anti-double stranded DNA, and renal disease. This protection did not reflect grossly defective T or B cell function per se because SH2D1A-deficient mice were susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a T cell-dependent disease, and they were capable of mounting normal T-independent antigen-specific immunoglobulin responses. Instead, T-dependent antibody responses were impaired in SH2D1A-deficient mice, reflecting defective germinal center formation. These findings demonstrate a specific role for the SLAM-SH2D1A system in the regulation of T-dependent humoral immune responses, implicating members of the CD150-SH2D1A family as targets in the pathogenesis and therapy of antibody-mediated autoimmune and allergic diseases.

15761493|a|X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) is an often-fatal immunodeficiency characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, fulminant infectious mononucleosis, and/or lymphoma. The genetic lesion in XLP, SH2D1A, encodes the adaptor protein SAP (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated [SLAM-associated] protein); however, the mechanism(s) by which mutations in SH2D1A causes hypogammaglobulinemia is unknown. Our analysis of 14 XLP patients revealed normal B cell development but a marked reduction in the number of memory B cells. The few memory cells detected were IgM(+), revealing deficient isotype switching in vivo. However, XLP B cells underwent proliferation and differentiation in vitro as efficiently as control B cells, which indicates that the block in differentiation in vivo is B cell extrinsic. This possibility is supported by the finding that XLP CD4(+) T cells did not efficiently differentiate into IL-10(+) effector cells or provide optimal B cell help in vitro. Importantly, the B cell help provided by SAP-deficient CD4(+) T cells was improved by provision of exogenous IL-10 or ectopic expression of SAP, which resulted in increased IL-10 production by T cells. XLP CD4(+) T cells also failed to efficiently upregulate expression of inducible costimulator (ICOS), a potent inducer of IL-10 production by CD4(+) T cells. Thus, insufficient IL-10 production may contribute to hypogammaglobulinemia in XLP. This finding suggests new strategies for treating this immunodeficiency.

16754717|a|X-linked lymphoproliferative disease is caused by mutations affecting SH2D1A/SAP, an adaptor that recruits Fyn to signal lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-related receptors. After infection, SLAM-associated protein (SAP)-/- mice show increased T cell activation and impaired humoral responses. Although SAP-/- mice can respond to T-independent immunization, we find impaired primary and secondary T-dependent responses, with defective B cell proliferation, germinal center formation, and antibody production. Nonetheless, transfer of wild-type but not SAP-deficient CD4 cells rescued humoral responses in reconstituted recombination activating gene 2-/- and SAP-/- mice. To investigate these T cell defects, we examined CD4 cell function in vitro and in vivo. Although SAP-deficient CD4 cells have impaired T cell receptor-mediated T helper (Th)2 cytokine production in vitro, we demonstrate that the humoral defects can be uncoupled from cytokine expression defects in vivo. Instead, SAP-deficient T cells exhibit decreased and delayed inducible costimulator (ICOS) induction and heightened CD40L expression. Notably, in contrast to Th2 cytokine defects, humoral responses, ICOS expression, and CD40L down-regulation were rescued by retroviral reconstitution with SAP-R78A, a SAP mutant that impairs Fyn binding. We further demonstrate a role for SLAM/SAP signaling in the regulation of early surface CD40L expression. Thus, SAP affects expression of key molecules required for T-B cell collaboration by mechanisms that are distinct from its role in cytokine regulation.

18212118|a|SAP (also named SH2D1A) is an intracellular adaptor molecule expressed in T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and some B cells. The SAP gene is mutated in X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) disease, a human immunodeficiency characterized by a faulty immune response to Epstein-Barr virus infection. Previous reports documented severe defects in antibody production and germinal center (GC) formation in SAP-deficient humans and mice genetically engineered to lack SAP expression. However, in vitro studies and adoptive transfer experiments provided conflicting data as to whether this phenotype is caused by a functional defect resulting from SAP deficiency in T cells, B cells, or both. Here, we ascertained which cell types are responsible for this humoral immunity defect by using a conditional gene targeting approach. We also thoroughly examined the expression pattern of SAP in normal immune cells by using intracellular flow cytometry. The results showed that expression of SAP in T cells, but not in B cells or NK cells, is required and sufficient for SAP-dependent antibody production and GC formation. These data provide a critical insight into the mechanism by which SAP regulates humoral immunity. They also help elucidate the basis of a severe human immunodeficiency.

18843362|a|Generation of long-term antibody-mediated immunity depends on the germinal centre reaction, which requires cooperation between antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. In human X-linked lymphoproliferative disease and its gene-targeted mouse model, loss-of-function mutations in signalling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein (SAP, encoded by SH2D1a) cause a profound defect in germinal centre formation by an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, using two-photon intravital imaging, we show that SAP deficiency selectively impairs the ability of CD4(+) T cells to stably interact with cognate B cells but not antigen-presenting dendritic cells. This selective defect results in a failure of antigen-specific B cells to receive adequate levels of contact-dependent T-cell help to expand normally, despite Sap(-/-) T cells exhibiting the known characteristics of otherwise competent helper T cells. Furthermore, the lack of stable interactions with B cells renders Sap(-/-) T cells unable to be efficiently recruited to and retained in a nascent germinal centre to sustain the germinal centre reaction. These results offer an explanation for the germinal centre defect due to SAP deficiency and provide new insights into the bi-directional communication between cognate T and B cells in vivo.

18453573|a|The Tec family kinase Itk regulates the development of conventional and innate CD8(+) T cells. However, little is known about the role of Itk in the development of CD4(+) T cell lineages, although the role of Itk in the T cell activation and function is well defined. We show in this study that Itk null mice have increased percentage of CD62L(low)CD44(high) memory phenotype CD4(+) T cells compared with wild-type mice. These cells arise directly in the thymus, express high levels of transcripts for the T-bet and IFN-gamma and are able to produce IFN-gamma directly ex vivo in response to stimulation. Itk deficiency greatly decreases the number of CD4(+) T cells with CD62L(high)CD44(low) naive phenotype, but has no effect on the number of memory phenotype CD4(+) T cells, indicating that the development of memory phenotype CD4(+) T cells is Itk-independent. We further show that the development of the naive phenotype CD4(+) T cells is dependent on active Itk signals and can be rescued by expression of Itk specifically in T cells. Our data also show that Itk is required for functional TCR signaling in these cells, but not for the innate function in response to IL-12/IL-18 or Listeria monocytogenes stimulation. These results indicate that CD62L(high)CD44(low) "naive" CD4(+) and CD62L(low)CD44(high) "innate memory phenotype" CD4(+) T cells may be independent populations that differ in their requirement for Itk signals for development. Our data also suggest that CD4(+)CD62L(low)CD44(high) memory phenotype T cells have innate immune function.

Similar to primed CD4(+) T cells in the tonsils and memory CD4(+) T cells in the peripheral blood, this follicular population of T cells expresses CXC-chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5). Owing to their distinct homing preferences and helper function, these T cells differ from T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells and have been denoted follicular B helper T cells.

However, when Itk is required during Th2 development is unclear. We followed the fate of Itk-deficient T cells during Th2 development in vitro and in vivo using an IL-4/GFP reporter. Surprisingly, a similar frequency of itk(-/-) CD4(+) cells differentiated and committed to the Th2 lineage as wild-type cells. However, Itk-deficient Th2 cells failed to exert effector function upon TCR triggering. Loss of function was marked by defective transcriptional enhancement of Th2 cytokines and GATA3. IL-4 production in itk(-/-) Th2s could be rescued by the expression of kinase-active Itk. Thus, Itk is necessary for the release, but not gain, of Th2 function. We suggest that the liberation of effector function is tightly controlled through qualitative changes in TCR signals, facilitating postdifferentiation regulation of cytokine responses.

17724129|a|Recently, a new developmental pathway for CD4 T cells that is mediated by major histocompatibility complex class II-positive thymocytes was identified (Choi, E.Y., K.C. Jung, H.J. Park, D.H. Chung, J.S. Song, S.D. Yang, E. Simpson, and S.H. Park. 2005. Immunity. 23:387-396; Li, W., M.G. Kim, T.S. Gourley, B.P. McCarthy, D.B. Sant'angelo, and C.H. Chang. 2005. Immunity. 23:375-386). We demonstrate that thymocyte-selected CD4 (T-CD4) T cells can rapidly produce interferon gamma and interleukin (IL) 4 upon in vivo and in vitro T cell receptor stimulation. These T-CD4 T cells appear to be effector cells producing both T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines, and they maintain a potential to produce Th2 cytokines under Th1-skewing conditions in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-independent manner. The IL-4 mRNA level is high in CD4 single-positive thymocytes if they are selected on thymocytes, which is at least partly caused by enhanced histone acetylation of the IL-4 locus. However, mice that can generate T-CD4 T cells showed attenuated immune responses in an allergen-induced airway inflammation model, suggesting a protective role for T-CD4 T cells during an airway challenge. Our results imply that this thymic selection pathway plays an important role in determining the effector function of the resulting CD4 cells and in regulating immune response.

10432283|a|Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib molecules have been implicated in CD8(+) T cell-mediated defenses against intracellular bacterial infection, but the relative importance of MHC class Ib-restricted T cells in antimicrobial immunity is unknown. In this report, we use MHC tetramers to characterize T cell responses restricted by H2-M3, an MHC class Ib molecule that selectively presents N-formyl peptides. We find that sizeable H2-M3-restricted T cell responses, occurring earlier than MHC class Ia-restricted T cell responses, are mounted after primary infection with the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. These H2-M3-restricted T cells are cytolytic and produce interferon gamma. However, after a second L. monocytogenes infection, H2-M3-restricted memory T cell responses are minor in comparison to the much larger MHC class Ia-restricted responses. This first direct characterization of an MHC class Ib-restricted T cell response indicates that CD8(+) T cells responding to L. monocytogenes infection can be divided into two groups: H2-M3-restricted responses, which provide rapid and quantitatively substantial effector function during primary infections but contribute relatively little to memory responses, and MHC class Ia-restricted responses, which expand later during primary infection but form memory T cells that respond rapidly and dramatically in response to subsequent infections by the same pathogen.

10523612|a|Differentiation of human T cells into T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cells is vital for the development of cell-mediated and humoral immunity, respectively. However, the precise mechanism responsible for the Th1 cell differentiation is not fully clarified. We have studied the expression and function of Txk, a member of the Tec family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. We found that Txk expression is restricted to Th1/Th0 cells with IFN-gamma producing potential. Txk transfection of Jurkat T cells resulted in a several-fold increase of IFN-gamma mRNA expression and protein production; interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 production were unaffected. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of Txk specifically inhibited IFN-gamma production of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, antigen-specific Th1 clones, and Th0 clones; IL-2 and IL-4 production by the T cells was unaffected. Txk cotransfection led to the enhanced luciferase activity of plasmid (p)IFN-gamma promoter/enhancer (pIFN-gamma[-538])-luciferase-transfected Jurkat cells upon mitogen activation. Txk transfection did not affect IL-2 and IL-4 promoter activities. Thus, Txk specifically upregulates IFN-gamma gene transcription. In fact, Txk translocated from cytoplasm into nuclei upon activation and transfection with a mutant Txk expression plasmid that lacked a nuclear localization signal sequence did not enhance IFN-gamma production by the cells, indicating that nuclear localization of Txk is obligatory for the enhanced IFN-gamma production. In addition, IL-12 treatment of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells enhanced the Txk expression, whereas IL-4 treatment completely inhibited it. These results indicate that Txk expression is intimately associated with development of Th1/Th0 cells and is significantly involved in the IFN-gamma production by the cells through Th1 cell-specific positive transcriptional regulation of the IFN-gamma gene.

11016936|a|Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase belonging to the Tec family of kinases, has been shown to be critical for B cell proliferation, differentiation, and signaling. Loss-of-function mutations in the Btk gene lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a primary immunodeficiency in humans, and the less severe condition xid in mice. Although Btk is mainly localized in the cytoplasm under steady state conditions, it translocates to the plasma membrane upon growth factor stimulation and cross-linking of the B cell receptor. Nevertheless, in ectopically as well as endogenously Btk-expressing cells, it can also translocate to the nucleus. Deletion of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (DeltaPH1) leads, however, to an even redistribution of Btk within the nucleus and cytoplasm in the majority of transfected cells. In contrast, an SH3-deleted (DeltaSH3) mutant of Btk has been found to be predominantly nuclear. We also demonstrate that the nuclear accumulation of DeltaPH1 is dependent on Src expression. This nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is sensitive to the exportin 1/CRM1-inactivating drug, leptomycin B, indicating that Btk utilizes functional nuclear export signals. In addition, while the DeltaPH1 mutant of Btk was found to be active and tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo, DeltaSH3 displayed decreased autokinase activity and was not phosphorylated. Our findings indicate that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Btk has implications regarding potential targets inside the nucleus, which may be critical in gene regulation during B cell development and differentiation.

11120822|a|Binding of the transcription factor Bright to Ig heavy chain loci after B cell activation is associated with increased heavy chain transcription. We now report that Bright coprecipitates with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), the defective enzyme in X-linked immunodeficiency disease (xid). Furthermore, we observed Btk in the nucleus of activated murine B cells, and mobility shift assays suggest that it is a component of the Bright DNA-binding complex. While BRIGHT protein was synthesized in activated spleen cells from xid mice, it did not bind DNA or associate stably with Btk. These data suggest that deficiencies in BRIGHT DNA-binding activity may contribute to the defects in Ig production seen in xid mice.

11859127|a|Precise mechanisms responsible for Th1 cell activation and differentiation are not fully elucidated. We have recently reported that Txk, a member of Tec family nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, is expressed on Th1/Th0 cells, and Txk regulates specifically IFN-gamma gene expression. In this study, we found that Txk bound to IFN-gamma promoter region. Txk transfection increased transcriptional activity of IFN-gamma promoter plus luciferase constructs severalfold, including IFN-gamma promoter -538, -208, and -53. IFN-gamma promoter -39 was refractory to the Txk transfection. The actual site to which Txk bound was the element consisting of -53 and -39 bp from the transcription start site of human IFN-gamma gene, a site distinct from several previously characterized binding sites. We found that the entire -53/-39 region was necessary for the binding to and function of Txk, because mutant promoter oligoDNA that contained contiguous five base substitutions dispersed throughout the -53/-39 inhibited the binding, and the mutant promoters did not respond to the Txk transfection. Similar sequences of this element are found within the 5' flanking regions of several Th1 cell-associated protein genes. Thus, Txk is expressed on Th1/Th0 cells with the IFN-gamma production and acts as a Th1 cell-specific transcription factor.

7829530|a|The control of phosphorylation by protein tyrosine kinases represents an important regulatory mechanism in T cell growth, function, and differentiation. We have identified a 62-kDa murine protein tyrosine kinase predominantly expressed within the T cell lineage, which we have termed Rlk (for Resting lymphocyte kinase). rlk mRNA was found to be expressed in the fetal thymus as early as day 13 of embryonic development as well as in adult thymus and mature resting peripheral T cells. The sequence of rlk showed that it is most closely related to the subfamily of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that includes the Btk, Itk, and Tec proteins. However, Rlk differs from these kinases by virtue of its unique aminoterminal domain, which lacks a region of pleckstrin homology common to the other members of this protein subfamily. Examination of rlk abundance within different T cell subpopulations revealed preferential expression in Th1 relative to Th2 T cell clones, suggesting a possible role in signal transduction pathways that selectively regulate cytokine production in mature CD4+ T cell subsets. Rlk thus represents a novel cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase with potential functions in intrathymic T cell development and mature T cell signaling.

18941202|a|Itk and Txk/Rlk are Tec family kinases expressed in T cells. Itk is expressed in both Th1 and Th2 cells. By contrast, Txk is preferentially expressed in Th1 cells. Although Itk is required for Th2 responses in vivo and Txk is suggested to regulate IFN-gamma expression and Th1 responses, it remains unclear whether these kinases have distinct roles in Th cell differentiation/function. We demonstrate here that Txk-null CD4(+) T cells are capable of producing both Th1 and Th2 cytokines similar to those produced by wild-type CD4(+) T cells. To further examine whether Itk and Txk play distinct roles in Th cell differentiation and function, we examined Itk-null mice carrying a transgene that expresses Txk at levels similar to the expression of Itk in Th2 cells. Using two Th2 model systems, allergic asthma and schistosome egg-induced lung granulomas, we found that the Txk transgene rescued Th2 cytokine production and all Th2 symptoms without notable enhancement of IFN-gamma expression. These results suggest that Txk is not a specific regulator of Th1 responses. Importantly, they suggest that Itk and Txk exert their effects on Th cell differentiation/function at the level of expression.

2961351|a|The activation of B lymphocytes from the resting stage to the proliferating stage and then to the fully differentiated antibody-secreting stage is a highly regulated and complicated process. B-cell activation can clearly proceed by a number of different routes, each promoted by different regulatory cells (macrophages, two types of helper T cells) and each dependent upon the properties of the relevant antigen molecules. In most cases the nature of the antigen may simply control the magnitude and/or duration of antigen receptor signaling. An antigen that by itself generates inefficient signaling may require additional signals from helper T cells to induce B-cell activation. In contrast, antigens derived from bacterial cell surface components, such as LPS, can directly activate B cells and macrophages. This vigorous, polyclonal responsiveness to certain bacterial components probably represents a specialized system to enhance antibody responses to bacteria, whereas helper T cell-dependent responses may be primarily useful in making antibodies against soluble proteins and viruses. Thus multiple pathways of B-cell activation probably are needed to generate adequate antibody responses against the variety of pathogenic micro-organisms encountered by vertebrates.

3014002|a|Evidence from a variety of laboratories indicates that crosslinking of B cell mIg induces a rapid increase in intracellular free calcium (Ca++i). This mobilized Ca++ appears to act in concert with diacylglycerol (DAG; also released upon mIg cross-linking) to optimally activate Ca++/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C, which plays a pivotal role in B cell activation. Here we report analysis of the source of this mobilized calcium and the mechanism responsible for its release into the cytosol. We observed the cross-linking of mIg induces the release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), presumably as a result of action of phospholipase C on plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2). The release of InsP3 and the elevation of Ca++i are coincidental, suggesting that they may be causally related. Finally, we demonstrate that submicromolar doses of InsP3 induce release of Ca++ from permeabilized cells that had preaccumulated 45Ca++ in the endoplasmic reticulum. On the basis of these findings we suggest that mIg cross-linking leads to mobilization of Ca++, in part by causing hydrolysis of PtdInsP2, yielding InsP3, which in turn causes release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum.

2501658|a|Egr-1 is a murine early growth factor-inducible gene that encodes a protein with zinc fingers and that is believed to be involved in transcriptional regulation. Expression of this gene was investigated in murine B lymphocytes stimulated through their receptor for antigen (surface immunoglobulin [sIg]) with antireceptor antibodies (anti-sIg). Rapid (by 15 min) up-regulation of Egr-1 mRNA expression was observed after sIg cross-linking at a dose of anti-sIg sufficient to drive the majority of cells into cell cycle. Interestingly, signaling through sIg on the murine B-lymphoma cell line WEHI-231 did not up-regulate Egr-1 expression even though similar signaling pathways, including up-regulation of c-fos expression, are associated with this receptor in these cells. Importantly, cell growth and proliferation of WEHI-231 cells were inhibited by anti-sIg stimulation, which suggested a relationship between Egr-1 expression and differential processing of receptor immunoglobulin signals with respect to cellular growth responses. This notion was further supported by the finding that murine B lymphomas whose proliferation was not inhibited by anti-sIg showed receptor immunoglobulin-coupled Egr-1 expression. In further support of this association are results showing that under conditions in which Egr-1 expression was induced in WEHI-231 cells in response to stimulation by anti-sIg, a concomitant change was observed in the growth response of these cells. These results, then, indicate a potential role for Egr-1 expression in the translation of receptor-generated signals into cellular activation or induced unresponsiveness.

2787345|a|The data presented here indicated that both membrane Ig and IL-4 receptors transduce signals across the plasma membrane of quiescent B cells, which results in the induction of c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogene mRNA expression. Monoclonal anti-Ig antibodies with specificity for mu, delta, or kappa chains, regardless of mitogenicity, induced increased c-fos and c-myc mRNA expression with kinetics and magnitude similar to that observed following stimulation of B cells with IL-4. Maximal levels of c-fos mRNA, approximately 30-fold over background, were observed 30 min after stimulation. Maximal levels of c-myc mRNA, approximately 10-fold over background, were observed 60 min after stimulation. Phorbol myristate acetate alone induced expression of these two oncogenes in a similar fashion, suggesting that protein kinase C may be involved in the regulation of their expression following anti-Ig crosslinking. Ionomycin induced only a small increase in c-myc and c-fos message (three- to four-fold), and did not synergize with phorbol myristate acetate, suggesting that the membrane Ig-mediated calcium mobilization may not play a major role in regulation of c-myc or c-fos expression in mouse B cells. In vitro nuclear run-on analyses indicate that c-myc expression is primarily regulated post-transcriptionally, whereas c-fos expression is regulated at the level of transcription. Anti-sense transcription was found to be constitutive for both the c-myc and C-fos loci and was further induced by anti-Ig and IL-4, suggesting an additional mechanism for regulation of these genes. The observation that both anti-Ig and IL-4 regulate the expression of c-fos and c-myc suggests that multiple second messenger generating systems regulate the expression of these oncogenes in normal B cells and that their expression may be necessary, but is not sufficient to drive quiescent B cells into cell cycle.

1694265|a|Signalling by membrane immunoglobulin, the B-lymphocyte antigen receptor, regulates B-cell maturation and activation. Crosslinking of membrane immunoglobulin by antigen or by anti-immunoglobulin antibodies inactivates immature B cells, eliminating many of the B cells capable of producing auto-antibodies. By contrast, crosslinking of membrane immunoglobulin promotes activation of mature B cells for clonal expansion and antibody production against foreign antigens. Crosslinking membrane IgM on the immature B-cell line WEHI-231 induces growth arrest. This response may be analogous to the deletion or inactivation of immature B cells that is induced by antigen or anti-IgM antibodies. Membrane immunoglobulin crosslinking stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis, which leads to increases in intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C. The induced phosphoinositide breakdown is important for inhibiting WEHI-231 growth (ref. 7 and D. Page, M.R.G., K. Fahey, L. Matsuuchi and A.L.D., manuscript submitted for publication), but may not be sufficient, as agents that elevate calcium and activate protein kinase C cause only partial growth arrest. We now show that in both mature splenic B cells and the immature B-cell line WEHI-231 crosslinking membrane immunoglobulin also stimulates phosphorylation of protein tyrosine, a reaction that has been implicated as a key regulator of cell growth. Most of these phosphorylations were not a consequence of the phosphoinositide pathway. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation is a second mode of transmembrane signalling by membrane immunoglobulin.

In addition, T cell activation by antigen is accompanied by increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation of components of the T cell antigen receptor.

1707541|a|Crosslinking membrane immunoglobulin (mIg), the B-cell antigen receptor, stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins. Since many receptors are phosphorylated after ligand binding, we asked if components of the mIg receptor complexes were tyrosine-phosphorylated after mIg crosslinking. Both mIgM and mIgD are noncovalently associated with at least two other proteins. mIgM is associated with the MB-1 protein, which is disulfide-linked to a protein designated Ig-beta. mIgD is not associated with MB-1 but is with IgD-alpha, which is also disulfide-linked to Ig-beta. Using immunoprecipitation with a specific anti-MB-1 antiserum followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, we found that crosslinking mIgM stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of MB-1, Ig-beta, and a previously unidentified 54-kDa polypeptide associated with MB-1. In mature splenic B cells that express both mIgM and mIgD, mIgM crosslinking stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 32-kDa MB-1 protein, whereas mIgD crosslinking stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of MB-1-related proteins of 33 and 34 kDa. The 32-kDa MB-1 protein was only associated with mIgM, whereas the 33- and 34-kDa MB-1-related proteins were specifically associated with mIgD and are most likely IgD-alpha. Thus, crosslinking either mIgM or mIgD stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation only of the MB-1-related proteins associated with that receptor.

2836499|a|Anti-IgM irreversibly inhibits the growth of WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells and induces phosphoinositide hydrolysis--producing diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which induces the release of calcium from intracellular storage sites into the cytoplasm, and other inositol polyphosphates. The roles of two of the possible second messengers, cytoplasmic free calcium and diacylglycerol, in mediating the action of anti-IgM on WEHI-231 cells were assessed by elevating [Ca2+]i with ionomycin and by activating protein kinase C with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu). The combination of 250 nM ionomycin and 4 to 7 nM PdBu was found to cause growth arrest and cell volume decrease responses in WEHI-231 cells which were similar to those caused by anti-IgM, although clearly slower. Both anti-IgM and the combination of mimicking reagents induced growth arrest of WEHI-231 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In both cases, this growth arrest was mitigated by addition of bacterial LPS. Moreover, 250 nM ionomycin plus 4 to 7 nM PdBu did not inhibit the growth of two other murine B lymphoma cell lines, each of which did exhibit increased phosphoinositide hydrolysis but not growth arrest in response to anti-Ig. Taken together, these results suggest that ionomycin and PdBu, at the concentrations used, did not inhibit WEHI-231 growth by general toxicity, but rather by mimicking the effects of the natural second messengers generated from Ag receptor cross-linking. Thus, the phosphoinositide-derived second messengers Ca2+i and diacylglycerol are capable of playing important roles in mediating the action of anti-IgM on WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells. However, the response of WEHI-231 cells to anti-IgM could not be fully reproduced with ionomycin and phorbol diester. These results suggest that another second messenger induced by anti-IgM may also play an important role in mediating the growth arrest of these cells.

6771019|a|During differentiation, B lymphocytes undergo a shift from expression of membrane-bound IgM to IgM secretion. The mu chains of membrane and secreted IgM, mum and mus, respectively, differ in the amino acid sequence of their carboxy terminal regions. In this paper, we demonstrate that mum and mus heavy chains are encoded by separate mRNAs of 2.7 and 2.4 kb, respectively. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis of mu cDNA clones from a myeloma tumor that produces both types of mu chain indicate that the mum and mus mRNAs are identical throughout the coding region up to the 3' end of the fourth constant region (Cmu 4) domain, but differ in their C terminal coding and 3' untranslated segments. From the nucleotide sequence of the mum cDNA clone, we predict the amino acid sequence of the 41-residue mum C terminal segment or "M" (membrane) segment. This sequence has characteristics consistent with its being a transmembrane peptide. Thus the mus chain has a 20-residue hydrophilic C terminal segment after the Cmu 4 domain, and the mum chain has a 41-residue C terminal segment containing a hydrophobic sequence. We propose that comparable C terminal segments also will be found in other membrane-bound immunoglobulin heavy chains.

2494658|a|To examine the isotypic and structural requirements involved in signaling through the immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor on B lymphocytes, we established a panel of T15 idiotype-positive transfectants that expressed wild-type IgM, wild-type IgD, or hybrid IgM molecules. Growth inhibition of the transfected lymphoma cells in response to anti-idiotype antibodies was used to measure signaling. Hybrid IgM molecules were constructed so that the membrane-spanning region of the mu heavy chain was replaced by that of delta, gamma 2b, or alpha heavy chains or that of the I-Ab class II (Ia) alpha chain. All transfectants that expressed IgM or hybrid IgM molecules with membrane-spanning regions from another Ig isotype underwent signaling in response to anti-idiotype antibodies, whereas the IgM-Ia hybrid transfectants did not. Transfectants that expressed wild-type IgD molecules also underwent signaling, although this response was particularly sensitive to serum concentrations. These results imply that signaling occurs in a similar manner through heavy-chain receptors of any isotype and suggest that conserved amino acid sequences in the transmembrane regions are important in this process.

2945204|a|The present study used cocultures of clonally derived B and T cells, together with an antigen reactive with the membrane Ig of the clonal B cells, to address the issue of B-cell differentiation requirements. The B cells were CH12.LX, an in vitro grown subclone of a murine B-cell lymphoma, which bears surface IgM reactive with sheep erythrocytes. The T cells were alloreactive T-helper-cell hybridomas. Very small numbers of T-helper cells could induce differentiation of cloned B cells without the presence of accessory cells, but such induction was dependent upon the presence of the antigen recognized by the B cell. Induced differentiation of the B cells did not depend on metabolic activity of the T cells, and metabolically active T cells could be replaced by fixed cells or by monoclonal antibody reactive with the class II molecule of the B cell to deliver an Ia-specific differentiative signal. T cells, or alloantibody that reacted with the I-E molecule, induced differentiation of the B cells; those that reacted with the I-A molecule did not. These results define the minimal requirements for major histocompatibility complex-restricted, T-cell-mediated induction of B-cell differentiation.

3131424|a|During B cell differentiation the mu H chain of IgM is produced initially as a cell surface (m) and later as a secreted (s) form. Production of either the secreted (microseconds) or the membrane (micron) mRNA results from selection of either the promoter proximal (microseconds) or distal (micron) poly(A)/cleavage site. We have transfected lymphoid cell lines of disparate developmental stages with productively rearranged Ig mu-chain constructs to determine the mechanism by which alternative 3' end selection is achieved. Stable transfectants of lymphomas (early stage, microseconds less than or equal to micron) and a plasmacytoma (late stage, microsecond much greater than micron) produce the anticipated levels of microsecond and micron mRNA. Transcription termination between the microsecond and micron poly(A) sites occurs only in the plasmacytoma transfectants, and appears to be the rate-limiting step in the production of the final steady state microsecond/micron mRNA ratio. We propose that as the B cell becomes terminally committed to secretion, the mechanism responsible for the regulation of the steady state microsecond/micron mRNA ratio shifts from exclusively post-transcriptional to predominantly transcriptional termination.

3925010|a|A20.2J B lymphoma cells have been co-transfected with the A alpha b, A beta b or with the A alpha b, A beta bm12 and neomycin resistance genes. The transfected cell lines constitutively express the I-Ab or I-Abm12 class II molecules at a level comparable with that of the endogenous I-Ad antigen. The I-Ab antigens expressed on three independently transfected B cell clones (A20.Ab.1, A20.Ab.2, and A20.Ab.3) are serologically and functionally indistinguishable from the I-Ab molecules expressed by control H-2bxd B hybridoma cells (LB cells). These transfected cell lines were potent I region-restricted antigen-presenting cells to a large panel of antigen-specific, autoreactive and alloreactive T cell hybridomas, as well as normal T cell clones. There were not significant differences in the efficiency of antigen presentation by the Ia molecules encoded by the transfected, as compared with the endogenous, I-A genes. The expression of a functional I-Ab antigen on the surface of cells transfected with A beta bm12 and A alpha b genes is consistent with previous work that implicated the A beta-chain alone in the bm 12 mutation. Furthermore, because the transfected A20.Ab and A20.Abm12 cells display the serologic and functional properties of normal spleen cells from the wild-type and mutant mouse strains, respectively, it is clear that class II genes do not undergo unexpected and unpredictable alterations after transfection in this system. This system permits us to investigate the structural requirements for interactions between class II major histocompatibility complex antigens, a foreign antigen, and the T cell receptor by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis coupled with DNA-mediated gene transfer.

7035186|a|Biological activities of monoclonal A/J antibodies to the T15 idiotype in BALB/c mice were compared to heterogeneous antibodies raised by conventional immunization procedures. Two monoclonal antibodies, AB1-2 and GB4-10, which are of the gamma 1, chi class, appeared to have identical specificities by binding criteria and reacted similarly to conventional antibodies in their abilities to induce neonatal suppression, inhibit plaque-forming cell induction by phosphorylcholine (PC) antigens and to inhibit specifically, anti-PC plaque-forming cells. However, in functional analyses of anti-PC responses in various strains of mice, discrepancies were noted in the T15 responses as defined by monoclonal antibodies and conventional antisera. This heterogeneity was also observed in adult mice suppressed with the GB4-10 monoclonal antibody. These animals eventually produced an anti-PC responses of AB1-2 idiotype but lacking the GB4-10 marker. These results show that the T15 IgM anti-PC response in BALB/c and other strains of mice is heterogeneous and probably consists of a family of clones. Particular clones can be precisely eliminated by the use of appropriate monoclonal antibodies, and the anti-PC response that eventually recovers is still T15+ but lacking the suppressed clones.

7033381|a|Hybridoma antibodies against the PC-binding T15 BALB/c myeloma protein were raised by cell fusion with anti-T15 A/He immune cells. The idiotype specificity of these monoclonal anti-T15 antibodies was determined with a panel of different myeloma and hybridoma immunoglobulins. Two types of anti-T15 antibodies are seen. One reacts with a number of different IgA myeloma proteins and with serum IgA of certain strains of mice; this reactivity most likely is due to allotypy. The other group consists of anti-T15 antibodies that are specific for the T15 idiotype and are therefore termed anti-idiotypic. The bindings of the anti-idiotype antibodies to T15 were specifically inhibited by T15 (F(ab')2 but not by other PC-binding myeloma proteins of different idiotypes. The relationship of the idiotype-specific anti-T15 antibodies to the PC-binding site of the T15 idiotype was analyzed by hapten inhibition of anti-idiotypic binding and by inhibition of BALB/c anti-PC splenic hemolytic plaque formation. Anti-T15 antibodies, for which the T15 binding is inhibited by PC or PC-BSA, also specifically inhibit anti-PC plaque formation. These antibodies are labeled site and near-site anti-idiotypic antibodies. Site and near-site-specific anti-idiotypic antibodies recognize different idiotopes on the T15 molecules. The possible differential biologic activities of these anti-idiotopes in idiotype network regulation is considered.

2521658|a|The immunomodulatory effects of an IgM anti-CD3 mAb (38.1) were investigated. 38.1 was distinct from other anti-CD3 mAb, in that it was rapidly modulated from the cell surface in the absence of a secondary antibody. Although 38.1 induced an immediate increase in intracellular free calcium [Ca2+]i by highly purified T cells, it did not induce entry of the cells into the cell cycle in the absence of accessory cells (AC) or a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester. Clearing of 38.1 from the surface of AC-depleted T cells, documented both by immunofluorescence and by functional activity, was rapid, with markedly reduced levels of initially bound mAb observed after a 1 to 2 h incubation at 37 degrees C and complete modulation noted after a 5-h incubation. Despite rapid modulation of 38.1, the T cells continued to express substantial amounts of surface CD3, suggesting there is a rapid rate of turnover of CD3 molecules on resting T cells. After modulation of 38.1 bound CD3, T cells were markedly inhibited in their capacity to respond to PHA. Inhibition could be overcome by culturing the cells with supplemental AC or IL-2. The inhibitory effects of 38.1 could be mimicked by briefly pulsing cells with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, that had no effect on surface expression of CD3. 38.1- or ionomycin-pulsed cells were inhibited in their subsequent response to PHA even when exposures were carried out in the presence of EGTA to prevent increases in [Ca2+]i from extracellular sources. Inhibition could not be accounted for by an inability of the ionomycin-treated or 38.1-modulated T cells to increase [Ca2+]i in response to PHA. These studies demonstrate that a state of T cell nonresponsiveness can be induced by modulating CD3 with an anti-CD3 mAb in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. A brief increase in [Ca2+]i resulting from mobilization of internal calcium stores appears to be sufficient to induce this state of T cell nonresponsiveness.

2789248|a|The endocytosis of Ag mediated by membrane-associated Ig (mIg) molecules has been spectrophotometrically monitored using a cell line (2C3) specific for the hapten phthalate (Xmp) and employing conjugates of Xmp and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as the labeled ligand. Approximately 50% of both Xmp-HRP, or the larger ligand, Xmp-keyhole limpet hemocyanin-HRP, are internalized rapidly, reaching an initial plateau by 30 min. The rate of endocytosis of anti-idiotype-HRP is similar to the rates that were observed for the hapten-bearing ligands, while a slower rate of endocytosis of anti-Ig-HRP was observed. The percent of ligand bound that is internalized and the rate of endocytosis appear to be largely independent of the size and amount of ligand bound per cell. However, mIg-mediated endocytosis is markedly reduced when mIg-ligand complexes are more extensively cross-linked by the binding of a second antibody. In addition to the initial rapid phase of endocytosis, there is a prolonged phase during which more of the bound ligand is internalized, and up to 90% of the internalized ligand is degraded. Re-expression of Ag-binding receptors by the 2C3 cells is independent of new protein synthesis and is accomplished in part by the translocation of a presynthesized pool of mIg molecules from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of the cell. The kinetics of endocytosis of HRP-labeled anti-Ig antibodies by BALB/c splenic B-lymphocytes and other B-lymphocyte cell lines is very similar to the endocytosis of Ag and anti-idiotype observed with the 2C3 cell line. Light and electron microscopy are also performed to visually confirm that the HRP-labeled ligands are being internalized and to determine the percentage of cells involved in this process. Finally it was determined that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the mIg molecules are required for endocytosis since the secreted form of the molecule (which lacks these domains) fails to mediate the internalization of bound ligand.

7006832|a|A 230,000 dalton polypeptide co-purifies through cycles of depolymerization and polymerization with the intermediate filament subunits, desmin and vimentin, from avian smooth muscle. This protein is also present in skeletal muscle and is distinct from myosin and filamin. Double immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured cells, using antisera shown to be specific by immunoautoradiography, has revealed that this protein has the same spatial distribution as desmin and vimentin. During skeletal myogenesis, all three antigens exist initially in multinucleate myotubes as wavy filaments throughout the cytoplasm. Within a week after myoblast fusion, they begin to coalesce at the peripheries of the myofibril Z discs, thereby attaining the distribution observed in mature muscle, a network of interlinked rings within the Z plane. Treatment of cultured myotubes with colcemid causes the filamentous forms of these three proteins to co-aggregate into cytoplasmic bundles, but has little effect on them when they are associated with the Z discs. Extraction of cells with nonionic detergent and high salt leaves cytoskeletons containing desmin, vimentin and the 230,000 dalton polypeptide with immunofluorescent patterns that are indistinguishable from one another. These data suggest that this high molecular weight protein is closely associated with desmin and vimentin filaments in muscle cells; to indicate this, we have named the protein synemin, from the Greek oa uv (with) and v eta mu alpha (filament).

2906142|a|As new techniques are developed to measure intracellular messengers it becomes increasingly apparent that there is a remarkable spatial and temporal organization of cell signalling. Cells possess a small discrete hormone-sensitive pool of inositol lipid. In some cells such as Xenopus oocytes and Limulus photoreceptors this phosphoinositide signalling system is highly concentrated in one region of the cell, so establishing localized calcium gradients. Another example is the hydrolysis of inositol lipids in eggs at the point of sperm entry resulting in a localized increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 and calcium which spreads like a wave throughout the egg. In hamster eggs this burst of calcium at fertilization recurs at 1-3 min intervals for over 100 min, a particularly dramatic example of spontaneous activity. Spontaneous oscillations in intracellular calcium exist in many different cell types and are often induced by agonists that hydrolyse inositol lipids. We have made a distinction between oscillations that are approximately sinusoidal and occur at a higher frequency where free calcium is probably continuously involved in the oscillatory cycle and those where calcium falls to resting levels for many seconds between transients. In the former case, the oscillations are thought to be induced through a cytoplasmic oscillator based on the phenomenon of calcium-induced calcium release. Such oscillations can be induced in Xenopus oocytes after injection with Ins(1,4,5)P3. A receptor-controlled oscillator based on the periodic formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 is probably responsible for the generation of the widely spaced calcium transients. The function of such calcium oscillations is currently unknown. They may be a reflection of the feedback interactions that operate to control intracellular calcium. Another possibility emerged from observations that in some cells the frequency of calcium oscillations varied with agonist concentration, suggesting that cells might employ these oscillations as a way of encoding information. One advantage of using such a frequency-dependent mechanism may lie in an increase in fidelity, especially at low agonist concentrations. Whatever these functions might be, it is clear that uncovering the mechanisms responsible for such oscillatory activity will greatly enhance our understanding of the relation between the phosphoinositides and calcium signalling.

Kinetic analysis indicates that TPA can substitute for diacylglycerol and greatly increases the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+ as well as for phospholipid. Under physiological conditions, the activation of this enzyme appears to be linked to the receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol breakdown which may be provoked by a wide variety of extracellular messengers, eventually leading to the activation of specific cellular functions or proliferation. Using human platelets as a model system, TPA is shown to enhance the protein kinase C-specific phosphorylation associated with the release reaction in the total absence of phosphatidylinositol breakdown. Various phorbol derivatives which have been shown to be active in tumor promotion are also capable of activating this protein kinase in in vitro systems.

6968316|a|Cell surface receptor IgM molecules of cultured human lymlphoblastoid cells (WiL2) patch and redistribute into a cap over the Golgi region of the cell after treatment with multivalent anti-IgM antibodies. During and after the redistribution, ligand-receptor clusters are endocytosed into coated pits and coated vesicles. Morphometric analysis of the distribution of ferritin-labeled ligand at EM resolution reveals the following sequence of events in the endocytosis of cell surface IgM: (a) binding of the multivalent ligand in a diffuse cell surface distribution, (b) clustering of the ligand-receptor complexes, (c) recruitment of clathrin coats to the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane opposite ligand-receptor clusters, (d) assembly and (e) internalization of coated vesicles, and (f) delivery of label into a large vesicular compartment, presumably partly lysosomal. Most of the labeled ligand enters this pathway. The recruitment of clathrin coats to the membrane opposite ligand-receptor clusters is sensitive to the calmodulin-directed drug Stelazine (trifluoperazine dihydrochloride). In addition, Stelazine inhibits an alternate pathway of endocytosis that does not involve coated vesicle formation. The actin-directed drug dihydrocytochalasin B has no effect on the recruitment of clathrin to the ligand-receptor clusters and the formation of coated pits and little effect on the alternate pathway, but this drug does interfere with subsequent coated vesicle formation and it inhibits capping. Cortical microfilaments that decorate with heavy meromyosin with constant polarity are observed in association with the coated regions of the plasma membrane and with coated vesicles. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of a coated vesicle preparation isolated from WiL2 cells demonstrates that the major polypeptides in the fraction are a 175-kdalton component that comigrates with calf brain clathrin, a 42-kdalton component that comigrates with rabbit muscle actin and a 18.5-kdalton minor component that comigrates with calmodulin as well as 110-, 70-, 55-, 36-, 30-, and 17-kdalton components. These results clarify the pathways of endocytosis in this cell and suggest functional roles for calmodulin, especially in the formation of clathrin-coated pits, and for actin microfilaments in coated vesicle formation and in capping.

2044154|a|Calmodulin is a small Ca(2+)-binding protein proposed to act as the intracellular Ca2+ receptor that translates Ca2+ signals into cellular responses. We have constructed mutant yeast calmodulins in which the Ca(2+)-binding loops have been altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Each of the mutant proteins has a dramatically reduced affinity for Ca2+; one does not bind detectable levels of 45Ca2+ either during gel filtration or when bound to a solid support. Furthermore, none of the mutant proteins change conformation even in the presence of high Ca2+ concentrations. Surprisingly, yeast strains relying on any of the mutant calmodulins not only survive but grow well. In contrast, yeast strains deleted for the calmodulin gene are not viable. Thus, calmodulin is required for growth, but it can perform its essential function without the apparent ability to bind Ca2+.

We have determined that calmodulin (CaM) stimulates this enzyme both in the presence and in the absence of free Ca2+. In the presence of 90 micron Ca2+ half-maximal stimulation of the enzyme occurred at 95 pM calmodulin. Comparable levels of calmodulin stimulation were observed when free Ca2+ levels were minimized by using EGTA-containing buffers. However, the concentration of CaM required for half-maximal stimulation of B. pertussis adenylate cyclase in the presence of 1 nM free Ca2+ was 24 nM. The apparent affinity of the enzyme for calmodulin was also significantly enhanced by Mn2+. In addition, troponin I inhibited calmodulin stimulation of the bacterial adenylate cyclase. Photoaffinity cross-linking experiments using azido[125I]calmodulin and B. pertussis adenylate cyclase revealed only one major cross-linked product having a molecular weight of 97000.

2956266|a|The microvillus 110-kD protein-calmodulin complex (designated 110K-CM) shares several properties with all myosins. In addition to its well-defined ATP-dependent binding interaction with F-actin, 110K-CM is an ATPase with diagnostically myosin-like divalent cation sensitivity. It exhibits maximum enzymatic activity in the presence of K+ and EDTA (0.24 mumol P1/mg per min) or in the presence of Ca++ (0.40 mumol P1/mg per min) and significantly less activity in physiological ionic conditions of salt and Mg++ (0.04 mumol P1/mg per min). This MgATPase is activated by F-actin in an actin concentration-dependent manner (up to 2.5-3.5-fold). The specific MgATPase activity of 110K-CM is also enhanced by the addition of 5-10 microM Ca++, but in the isolated complex, there is often also a decrease in the extent of actin activation in this range of free Ca++. Actin activation is maintained, however, in samples with exogenously added calmodulin; under these conditions, there is an approximately sevenfold stimulation of 110K-CM's enzymatic activity in the presence of 5-10 microM Ca++ and actin. 110K-CM is relatively indiscriminant in its nucleoside triphosphate specificity; in addition to ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP, and ITP are all hydrolyzed by the complex in the presence of either Mg++ or Ca++. Neither AMP nor the phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate are substrates for the enzymatic activity. The pH optimum for CaATPase activity is 6.0-7.5; maximum actin activation of MgATPase occurs over a broad pH range of 6.5-8.5. Finally, like myosins, purified 110K-CM crosslinks actin filaments into loosely ordered aggregates in the absence of ATP. Collectively these data support the proposal of Collins and Borysenko (1984, J. Biol. Chem., 259:14128-14135) that the 110K-CM complex is functionally analogous to the mechanoenzyme myosin.

The third, or promoter-proximal, domain can be divided into several distinct sites, one containing a directly repeated GC-rich element and the other consisting of partially overlapping recognition sites for transcription factors ATF/CREB and MLTF/USF. Each of these sites contributes to basal activity as assayed by transient transfections and by in vitro transcription. Consistent with this, several complexes could be visualized between this region and nuclear proteins in vitro and genomic footprinting demonstrated that both elements are constitutively bound in vivo. On the basis of these results, we conclude that all three domains are necessary for full c-fos promoter function.

3194021|a|The c-fos proto-oncogene provides a good system to study the processes underlying messenger RNA degradation. After growth factor stimulation of susceptible cells, the c-fos transcription rate transiently increases from a low basal level by as much as 50-fold, producing a large amount of exceedingly unstable c-fos mRNA that is rapidly degraded. Here, we investigate the c-fos mRNA degradation process, and find that: (1) ongoing translation of the c-fos mRNA itself is required for its degradation; (2) after synthesis, the mRNA poly(A) tail is rapidly removed, in a translation-dependent manner, leading to accumulation of apparently deadenylated RNA; (3) deletion or replacement of an AU-rich sequence at the mRNA 3' end significantly stabilizes the mRNA; (4) deletion of the 3' AU-rich sequences dramatically slows the poly(A) shortening rate. These results suggest that the 3' AU-rich sequences act to destabilize the mRNA by directing rapid removal of the mRNA poly(A) tract.

2304550|a|The antigen receptors on mature B lymphocytes are membrane-bound immunoglobulins of the IgM and IgD classes whose cross-linking by polyvalent antigens results in B-cell proliferation and differentiation. How these membrane-bound immunoglobulin chains, which lack a cytoplasmic tail, generate a cell activation signal is not at present known. We now show that the IgM molecule is non-covalently associated in the membrane of B cells with two proteins of relative molecular mass 34,000 (Mr 34 K; IgM-alpha) and 39 K (Ig-beta) which form a disulphide-linked heterodimer. Surface expression of IgM seems to require the formation of an appropriate complex between IgM and the heterodimer. A transfection experiment indicates that IgM-alpha is the product of mb-1, a B-cell specific gene encoding a transmembrane protein with sequence homology to proteins of the T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex.

2357960|a|Studies presented here demonstrate that IgM and IgD molecules on normal murine B lymphocytes exist in different, noncovalently associated molecular complexes containing distinct but potentially related glycoproteins. The glycoproteins in these complexes, particularly those associated with IgD, show striking differences in various lymphoid organs and in X-linked immunodeficient (Xid) mice. These differences are due in part to post-translational processing. They apparently reflect the differential expression of the Ig-associated glycoproteins in the various B cell subpopulations and lineages and the differential distribution of the subpopulations and lineages in the various lymphoid organs. In addition, they reflect structural differences in the IgM and IgD complexes which, we suggest, permit differential signal transduction by IgM and IgD on the same B cell.

2154371|a|T and B lymphocyte antigen receptors exhibit single transmembrane spanning regions and very short, three to five amino acid, C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. Ligation of these receptors leads, apparently through GTP binding protein activation, to rapid stimulation of a polyphosphoinositide specific phosphodiesterase (PPI-PDE). T lymphocyte antigen receptors (alpha beta) are coupled to PPI-PDE via a receptor associated complex of membrane proteins, designated CD3. Although an analogous transducer complex is presumed to exist in B cells, no such structure has been defined. We utilized in vitro [32P]phosphorylation to identify and characterize a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) associated phosphoprotein complex which appears to represent a B cell analog of CD3. The phosphoprotein complex consists of three N-glycosylated polypeptides which occur as disulfide linked dimers, non-covalently associated with mIg. The complex associated with mIgM (pp32, pp34 and pp37 subunits) differs from that associated with mIgD (pp33, pp34 and pp37 subunits), and the isotype specific phosphoprotein (pp32 or pp33) appears to exist as a disulfide linked heterodimer with either pp34 or pp37. Aluminum fluoride stimulates phosphorylation of all of the subunits, and at least one of the proteins is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue(s).

1702903|a|Antigen is thought to cross-link membrane-bound immunoglobulins (Igs) of B cells, causing proliferation and differentiation or the inhibition of growth. Protein tyrosine kinases are probably involved in signal transduction for cell proliferation and differentiation. The Src-like protein tyrosine kinase Lyn is expressed preferentially in B cells. The Lyn protein and its kinase activity could be coimmunoprecipitated with IgM from detergent lysates. Cross-linking of membrane-bound IgM induced a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of at least ten distinct proteins of B cells. Thus, Lyn is physically associated with membrane-bound IgM, and is suggested to participate in antigen-mediated signal transduction.

The addition of fresh chicken serum or trypsin to the medium of density-inhibited cells causes a large increase in the rate of glucose transport that is detectable 15 min after addition. The increase in glucose transport precedes the increase in DNA synthesis by 5-6 hr. Only small changes in rates of transport are seen with nucleosides or a nonmetabolizable amino acid.

944704|a|The effect of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), a 5,400 molecular weight polypeptide isolated from human urine, on the growth of human foreskin fibroblasts (HF cells) was studied by measuring cell numbers and the incorporation of labeled thymidine. The addition of hEGF to HF cells growing in a medium containing 10% calf serum resulted in a 4-fold increase in the final density. The presence of hEGF also promoted the growth of HF cells in media containing either 1% calf serum or 10% gamma globulin-free serum. The addition of hEGF to quiescent confluent monolayers of HF cells, maintained in a medium with 1% calf serum for 48 hours, resulted in a 10- to 20-fold increase in the amount of 3H-thymidine incorporation after 20-24 hours. The stimulation of thymidine incorporation was maximal at an hEGF concentration of 2 ng/ml, was dependent on the presence of serum, and was enhanced by the addition of ascorbic acid. In confluent cultures of HF cells, subject to density dependent inhibition of growth, hEGF was able to stimulate DNA synthesis more effectively than fresh calf serum. Human EGF stimulated DNA synthesis in quiescent cultures, however, regardless of cell density. The addition of rabbit anti-hEGF inhibited all effects of this growth factor on HF cells.

125153|a|We have asked whether treatment of normal cultured cells with proteases, other hydrolytic enzymes, or serum can convert them into transient phenocopies of transformed cells with respect to the very high rate of hexose transport characteristic of transformed cells. Treatment of density-inhibited cultures of normal chick embryo fibroblasts with trypsin, plasmin, neuraminidase, or hyaluronidase stimulated their rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake to a level only marginally higher than that seen in normal exponentially growing cultures, and only 35-45% of that seen in transformed cultures. Addition of the hydrolytic enzymes to growing cell cultures had little effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Serum, however, could stimulate 2-deoxyglucose uptake all the way up to the transformed level. Even though the hydrolases and serum differed in their ability to stimulate 2-deoxyglucose uptake, both reagents were capable of stimulating cell division equally well. Evidence is presented suggesting that the hexose transport rate is controlled by serum factors, and that proteolysis can affect the response of the cells of these factors.

171666|a|The rate of DNA synthesis in cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts is reduced by deprivation of serum, high population density, and other "physiological" effectors, through a reduction in the number of cells in the S-period of the cell cycle. The same effect can be produced by drastically reducing the concentration of Mg++ added to the medium. This effect is erratic, however, and better control of [Mg++] can be achieved with phosphorylated compounds which preferentially bind Mg++. Both ATP and ADP, at concentrations in the medium less than or equal to [Mg++], stimulate DNA synthesis in cultures, and at greater concentrations inhibit DNA synthesis by affe-ting the proportion of cells in the S-period. Sodium pyrophosphate, which strongly complexes Mg++, causes little stimulation of DNA synthesis at low concentrations, but causes a striking decrease at concentrations exceeding [Mg++] of the medium. The inhibition can be fully reversed by adding an excess of Mg++, and the kinetics of increase in DNA synthesis resemble those which follow the restoration of serum to serum-deprived cultures. Limitation of [Mg++] by pyrophosphate also reduces the rates of RNA and protein synthesis, 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake, and lactic acid production to an extent comparable to the reduction caused by the removal of serum from the medium. A model for the coordinate control of metabolism, differentiated function, and growth through the activity of divalent cations is described. The compartmentalization of Mg++ within the cell serves as the key element in this coordinate control by regulating those metabolic pathways in which the rate-limiting steps are transphosphorylation reactions.

Increasing the Ca++ concentration above the standard 1.8 mM in the medium of a new culture increases the total number of cells ultimately produced, without affecting the initial cell growth rate. This effect is synergistic with that of serum. The elevated Ca++ concentration also induces striking morphological changes. The Ca++ effect could not be reproduced by a Ca++ ionophore. These observations afford a new tool for studying how the various intracellular events following the addition of growth factors to resting cultures are involved in the control of cellular growth.

Fresh, low-calcium (0.02 mM physiologically available) medium also causes cells to start a growth-division cycle. Howver, the development of such stimulated, calcium-deprived cells tops just before the expected time of initiation of DNA synthesis, which can then be rapidly induced by restoration of the normal calcium concentration. Simply raising the calcium concentration to nonphysiologically high levels (without otherwise altering the medium) can mimic the action of fresh serum or fresh whole medium by inducing some of the cells in proliferatively quiescent confluent concluent cultures to start a growth-division cycle and initiate DNA synthesis 22 hr later.

Maximum effect is approximately two fold over control levels for 3T3 cells and about 50% over controls for human fibroblasts. Maximum effect on 3T3 cells is seen about two hours after addition of 10 ng/ml EGF to the culture medium. Stimulation is easily measureable within the first fifteen minutes after addition of the hormone and may be detected at hormone concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/ml. The EGF-binding arginine esterase found associated with EGF in the mouse submaxillary gland causes an enhancement of the EGF effect. In serum-free medium, the EGF effect is still readily observed, but no enhancement by the esterase is seen. SV40 virus-transformed 3T3 cells show no effect on deoxyglucose uptake after addition of 10 ng/ml EGF to the culture medium, but a response may be demonstrated after these cells are incubated for 12 hours or more in serumless medium. EFG stimulates transport of 3-O-methylglucose in stationary phase 3T3 and human fibroblasts but no EGF stimulation of alpha-amino-isobutyrate uptake in 3T3 cells is seen under conditions is reproted to inhibit intracellular degradation of human EGF by human fibroblasts, does not diminish the EGF effect on deoxyglucose uptake in human fibroblasts.

557045|a|Previous studies have shown that initiation of proliferation of density-inhibited fibroblasts by fresh serum is accompanied by a rapid increase in phosphate uptake. This increase might be a key event in the initiation of DNA synthesis. The present studies examined this possibility. Mouse 3T3, secondary chick embryo, or human diploid foreskin cultures were grown to quiescence in medium containing varying levels of serum. When proliferation of the cultures was initiated by addition of fresh serum, the changes in phosphate uptake were inversely related to the final increases in cell number. Additional experiments showed that the change in phosphate uptake following serum addition was determined by the level of phosphate uptake prior to serum addition. Addition of dexamethasone to quiescent 3T3 cultures caused them to proliferate but did not increase phosphate uptake. Similarly, trypsin or insulin stimulated proliferation of quiescent secondary chick embryo cultures, but caused little or no change in phosphate uptake. Quiescent 3T3 cultures switched to medium containing fresh serum and reduced levels of phosphate showed a decrease in both phosphate uptake and intracellular phosphate pool size. Cell proliferation in these cultures, however, was stimulated to the same degree as cultures switched to medium containing fresh serum and the normal amount of phosphate. In addition, quiescent secondary chick embryo cultures switched to medium containing fresh serum and no phosphate showed a decrease in the intracellular phosphate pool size. Thymidine incorporation and final cell number in these cultures, however, was stimulated to the same or higher degree than in cultures switched to medium containing fresh serum and the normal amount of phosphate. These results demonstrate that the rapid increase in phosphate uptake following addition of fresh serum to quiescent fibroblasts is not a necessary event for the initiation of proliferation.

4331502|a|Sparse and dense cultures of chick embryo cells were affected differently by pH. The rates of cell multiplication and of thymidine-(3)H incorporation into DNA of dense cultures were increased as the pH was increased from 6.6 to 7.6. At pH higher than 7.6 the rate of multiplication decreased slightly in the dense cultures, but the rate of thymidine-(3)H incorporation continued to increase. The discrepancy was due in part to cell death and detachment at very high pH, and in part to a more rapid uptake of thymidine-(3)H at very high pH. Sparse cultures were much less sensitive to pH reduction and, when a suitably conditioned medium was used to minimize cell damage, very sparse cultures grew almost as well at pH 6.7 as at higher pH. The rates of cell multiplication and thymidine-(3)H incorporation at low pH decreased in the initially sparse cultures before they reached confluent cell densities. There was no microscope evidence of direct contact between plasma membranes of cells at these densities although the parallel orientation indicated that the cells were influencing locally each other's behavior. Even at much higher cell densities, electron microscopy revealed large intercellular gaps partly filled with a fragmentary electron-opaque material suspected to be glycoprotein. Wounding experiments showed that pH affected cell migration in a manner similar to its effects on cell multiplication. Low pH inhibited cell migration, but those cells which migrated into the denuded region multiplied as rapidly at low pH as at high pH. The effects of pH on growth were correlated with effects on the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose-(3)H. Dense populations of cells inhibited by low pH were stimulated to incorporate thymidine-(3)H by the addition of small amounts of diethylaminoethyl-dextran. Rous sarcoma cells at high cell density were less sensitive to pH than were normal cells at the same density, but were more sensitive than sparse normal cultures. The results suggest that cell growth is inhibited through the combined effects of both lowered pH and high cell density on cell surface permeability.

188837|a|Hexose uptake by hamster cells was increased five to ten fold by either substituting D-fructose for glucose or by completely omitting D-glucose from the culture medium for 24 to 48 hours. Conversely, when cycloheximide was present for 24 hours in media containing glucose, up to 20-fold decreases in hexose uptake were observed. However, these decreases in uptake activity were only observed over a narrow range of cycloheximide concentrations. After extended exposure to low concentrations of cycloheximide (0.05 to 10 mug/ml), the uptake by the fed cells decreased parallel with inhibition of protein synthesis whereas at high concentrations (greater than 50 mug/ml) uptake was increased. Cells deprived of glucose and maintained in the presence of cycloheximide did not show decreases in uptake activity. In separate experiments the high uptake rates of glucose-starved cells could be decreased by addition of glucose-free medium. The reversal was complete in 6 to 8 hours. The analog of glucose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, did not promote the time-dependent decrease suggesting that the 6-phosphoester of glucose is not an inhibitor of transport. In addition, when cycloheximide is added at the same time as glucose, there is no decrease in uptake for at least 12 hours. We propose that turnover of components of hexose uptake systems could account for part of the control of hexose transport. Moreover, the results indicate that the turnover mechanism becomes inactive during glucose starvation and must be resynthetized following refeeding of the starved cells with glucose.

Membrane phospholipids of erythrocyte ghosts treated with Ca2+ and phosphate ions become exposed to attack by phospholipase C (phosphatidylcholine cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.3) (Bacillus cereus). Freeze-fracture pictures of fused erythrocyte ghosts show the presence of regions deficient in intramemebrane particles in the protoplasmic face which we believe to be regions of fusion. Discontinuous regions of the protoplasmic and exoplasmic faces are observed, which are apparently intermediate stages in the process of fusion. TH-in-section electron micrographs reveal deposits of calcium phosphate in areas of contact and fusion of ghosts. Ca2+ in the presence of N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]glycine (Tricine) buffer causes the formation of blebs in the membrane but does not cause changes in the intramembrane particle pattern or induce fusion. It is suggested that nascent calcium phosphate acts by forming protein-free regions of phospholipid bilayer which can fuse readily.

At 37 degrees C, the cell-bound 125I-hEGF initially may be recovered in a native form by acid extraction; upon subsequent incubation, the cell-bound 125I-hEGF is degraded very rapidly, with the appearance in the medium of 125I-monoiodotyrosine. At 0 degrees C, cell-bound 125I-hEGF is not degraded but slowly dissociates from the cell. The data are consistent with a mechanism in which 125I-hEGF initially is bound to the cell surface and subsequently is internlized before degradation. The degradation is blocked by inhibitors of metabolic energy production (azide, cyanide, dinitrophenol), some protease inhibitors (Tos-Lys-CH2Cl, benzyl guanidobenzoate), a lysosomotropic agent (chloroquine) various local anesthetics (cocaine, lidocaine, procaine), and ammonium chloride. After the binding and degradation of 125I-hEGF the fibroblasts are no longer able to rebind fresh hormone. The binding capacity of these cells is restored by incubation in a serum-containing medium; this restoration is inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D.

1064038|a|Conditionally tumorigenic BALB/3T3 mouse cells (which produce tumors in BALB/c mice only under special conditions) cannot sustain DNA synthesis and consequently stop proliferating in media containing low concentrations (0-0.02 mM) of physiologically available calcium. By contrast, cells that have been neoplastically transformed (tumorigenic in mice without special assistance) in vitro by different oncogens, can sustain DNA synthesis and proliferate in such calcium-deficient media. The possible importance for tumor growth of an ability to withstand calcium deprivation is examined. It is suggested that this property may prove to be a reliable indicator of neoplastic transformation.

188831|a|The plant lectin, concanavalin A (Con-A), and the ionophore, A-23187 (specific for divalent cations), stimulated glucose transport in rat thymocytes. Con-A stimulation developed more slowly and was somewhat less extensive than that of stimulation developed more slowly and was somewhat less extensive than that of A-23187. Both responses showed saturation dose dependencies. The two responses were poorly additive, suggesting that A-23187 may saturate regulatory processes shared by the two stimulatory mechanisms. Doses of methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) and prostaglandin E2 which raised adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels in these cells also antagonized the Con-A stimulation of glucose transport but did not inhibit basal glucose transport or the A-23187 stimulation. Dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP also natagonized Con-A stimulation without inhibiting basal glucose transport. MIX antagonized high Con-A doses about as strongly as it did low Con-A doses, suggesting that MIX did not compete in the Con-A binding step or other process saturable by Con-A. [3H-A1Con-A binding was not affected by MIX. The stimulatory effects of Con-A and A-23187 were reduced by reduction of Ca++ in the medium. Both Con-A and A-23187 enhanced 45Ca++ influx and cellular Ca++ content. The A-23187 dose, which was saturating for glucose transport stimulation, enhanced Ca++ influx and cellular Ca++ content more than did the Con-A dose which was saturating for glucose transport stimulation. The dose fo MIX which specifically antagonized Con-A stimulation of glucose transport proved also to reduce Ca++ influx and cellular Ca++ in the presence of Con-A but not in the presence of A-23187. Thus, glucose transport correlates rather well with cellular Ca++. These results are compatible with the view that Ca++ in a cellular compartment can promote glucose transport, the Con-A's enhancement of Ca++ entry contributes to its stimulation of glucose transport, and the MIX antagonized Con-A action at least partly by reducing Ca++ entry. The action of MIX is apparently mediated by cAMP.

4531040|a|A23187 is a carboxylic antibiotic that selectively transfers calcium, magnesium, and other divalent cations across biologic membranes. This ionophore was found to produce morphologic blast transformation, DNA synthesis, and mitosis in human lymphocytes. Several hours of ionophore-cell contact were necessary to produce optimal mitogenesis. The effects were highly dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium and much less dependent on extracellular magnesium. Lanthanum chloride prevented the development of the observed ionophore effects. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that under physiologic conditions the interaction of antigens or mitogens with specific receptors at the lymphocyte membrane initiates events that alter calcium fluxes and result in increased cytoplasmic calcium. Increased cytoplasmic calcium is postulated to play a central role in the generation of surface-to-nuclear signals that initiate the process of DNA synthesis and cell division.

200943|a|Addition of 0.1-0.5 mM sodium PP(i) for 17 hr to confluent cultures of BALB/c 3T3 cells in low serum concentrations stimulated the incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine into DNA to an extent equal to that produced by high serum concentration. PP(i) prevented much but not all of the cell detachment that accompanies decreasing the serum concentration of confluent cultures and it increased the saturation density of cultures in high serum concentrations. The stimulation had a sharp concentration dependence and was associated with the appearance in the medium of a flocculent precipitate. Stimulation and precipitate formation were dependent on Ca(2+) and inorganic orthophosphate (HPO(4) (2-)) and were inhibited by Mg(2+). More than half the Ca(2+) requirement could be met with Sr(2+). In the absence of PP(i), supranormal concentrations of either Ca(2+) or HPO(4) (2-) caused graded increases in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and total cell yield. The effect of supranormal [Ca(2+)] depended on [HPO(4) (2-)] and vice versa, and the Ca(2+) requirement could be partially met by Sr(2+). The stimulation was associated with increasing turbidity of the medium. Various other complexing agents of Ca(2+), including the divalent cation ionophore A 23187, failed to produce stimulation of 3T3 cells. We conclude that water insoluble complexes of PP(i), HPO(4) (2-), and Ca(2+) or, at much higher concentrations, the latter two together, stimulate 3T3 cells and we speculate that this is brought about by the association of these complexes with the cell membrane.

3161881|a|We have reacted N-hydroxysuccinimidyl biotin with the principal curarimimetic toxin in Naja naja siamensis venom, biotinylating each of the five lysine residues and the N-terminal isoleucine. The six monobiotinyl-toxins were isolated by ion-exchange chromatography, and the residue modified in each was identified by peptide mapping and amino acid analysis. We evaluated the role of each lysine in the binding of toxin to the acetylcholine receptor by measuring the affinity of each biotinyltoxin for receptor and by determining which biotinyltoxins could bind receptor and avidin simultaneously. The effect of biotinylation of each residue decreased the affinity of toxin for receptor in the order Lys 23 greater than Lys 49 greater than Lys 35 greater than Lys 69 congruent to Lys 12 greater than Ile 1. Biotinyltoxin modified either at Lys 12 or at Lys 69 is effective in cross-linking avidin to receptor, while biotinyltoxin modified at Lys 49 can form a low-affinity avidin-biotinyltoxin-receptor complex. Taken together, these results help define the surface of toxin that binds to receptor.

3663591|a|alpha-Bungarotoxin (alpha Bgt) is a postsynaptic neurotoxin which blocks cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by binding tightly to the acetylcholine receptor (AcChR). The number of methylation sites in alpha Bgt has been shown to decrease significantly upon binding of the toxin to the AcChR [Soler, G., Farach, M. C., Farach, H. A., Mattingly, J. R., & Martinez-Carrion, M. (1983) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 225, 872-878]. We have compared the chemical reactivities of amino groups in free and AcChR-bound alpha Bgt in an attempt to identify the regions in the alpha Bgt molecule that become masked upon binding to the AcChR. Free alpha Bgt and AcChR-bound alpha Bgt were reductively methylated with formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride, and the rate of modification of each one of the available amino groups was followed by cleaving the methylated toxin with V8 protease and resolving the resulting peptides by reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography. Under conditions of limited reagent availability, five of seven amino groups in free alpha Bgt reacted readily, whereas two other amino groups, probably those corresponding to Lys-51 and Lys-70, displayed lower reactivity. Upon binding to the AcChR, the rates of reductive methylation of residues Ile-1, Lys-26, and Lys-38 were considerably reduced (although to differing extents). The degree of protection was most pronounced for Lys-26. The rates of methylation of the amino groups in all other positions remained unchanged. These results allow further definition of the minimal binding surface of a representative neurotoxin.

It neutralizes the biological activity of the toxin under both the vivo and in vitro conditions. The molecular zone of the toxin to which the antibody binds has been precisely defined on the basis of cross-reaction experiments using five derivative of toxin alpha monomodified at a single amino group and two naturally occurring homologous toxins. The epitope is located at the base of the first beta-sheet loop of the toxin, involving the two positive charges at the N-terminal position and lysine-15 proline-18, and probably threonine-16. It is shown that this region is topographically distinct from the "toxic" site of toxin alpha. Several possibilities are offered to explain the mechanisms(s) of specific neutralization.

6323181|a|Five derivatives of Naja nigricollis toxin alpha, spin-labeled on a single amino group, were prepared. The toxin derivatives were purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange and high-pressure liquid chromatographies. The modified amino groups are localized at residue 1 and lysines 15, 27, 47 and 51. Competition data show that incorporation of spin label at residues 27 or 47 reduces the affinity of the toxin for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChR), while incorporation at residues 1 or 15 diminishes toxin affinity for a monoclonal toxin-specific immunoglobulin (M alpha 1). Classical and/or saturation transfer electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis was carried out on each derivative, either in the free state or bound to AcChR or M alpha 1. The data obtained give the following indications. In the free state, the nitroxides incorporated at residues 1, 15, 47 and 51 have their own rapid motion, while that at residue 27 had no residual mobility and reflects the toxin rotation. Binding of AcChR to the toxin reduces the motion of the nitroxide bound to Lys47. Binding of M alpha 1 to the toxin immobilizes the two nitroxides fixed on residues 1 and 15. ESR spectra show that Lys27-bound nitroxide remains immobilized upon binding of either AcChR or M alpha 1. The change in nitroxide immobilization observed upon AcChR or M alpha 1 binding correlates well with the variation of nitroxide accessibility to a water-soluble paramagnetic N2+i ion. Binding of the labeled Lys47 toxin derivative to AcChR yields a complex ESR signal, disclosing the existence of a physical difference between the two toxin binding sites on AcChR. All the data indicate that AcChR and M alpha 1 bind at two topographically distinct sites on the toxin surface.

1067597|a|The three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin b, a neurotoxin in the venom of the sea snake Laticauda semifasciata, has been determined from a 2.75 A resolution electron density map. Erabutoxin b is one of a family of snake venom neurotoxins, all low-molecular-weight proteins, which block neuromuscular transmission at the postsynaptic membrane. They specifically inhibit the acetylcholine receptor. The molecular shape is that of a shallow elongated saucer with a footed stand formed by the six-membered ring at the COOH-terminal end. The central core of the molecule is an assembly of four disulfide bridges. Three long chain loops emerge as broad fronds from the core region. Approximately 40% of the main chain is organized into a twisted antiparallel beta-pleated sheet of five short strands. In 28 snake venom neurotoxins of established sequence which inhibit the acetylcholine receptor, the four disulfide bridges and seven other residues remain invariant. Three substitution positions conserve residue type. In one wing of the molecule, there is a broad shallow depression which may characterize the reactive site. It is populated by the sevent invariant residues and two of the three type conserved residues. This region is "anchored" on the undersurface of the molecule by the hydroxyl group of Ser-9, the remaining conservatively substituted residue.

1148181|a|The complete covalent structure of a small, basic protein with cardiotoxic activity is described. This has been isolated from the venom of Naja nigricollis by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 and gradient ion exchange chromatography on Bio-Rex 70. The cardiotoxin, molecular weight 6806 from amino acid composition, consists of 60 amino acids, cross-linked by four disulfide bridges, connecting 3-21, 14-38, 42-53, and 54-59. The protein contains one residue of tryptophan, phenylalanine, and glutamic acid, two residues of arginine and tyrosine, four residues of methionine, and nine residues of lysine. Histidine is absent. The chymotryptic peptides of the oxidized and S-carboxymethylated protein were isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 and zone electrophoresis on a cellulose column. The sequence was determined by Edman degradation, using the (manual) direct phenylthiohydantoin method and with the use of carboxypeptidase A. Disulfide pairing was determined on thermolysin cleaved peptides from the native protein. The sequence is shown to be homologous to other cardiotoxins and a lytic factor from snake venoms and also shows homology, both in sequence and disulfide pairing to neurotoxins. A partial reduction experiment in the absence of denaturing agent using 14-C-labeled iodoacetic acid as S-carboxymethylating agent shows that disulfide bonds 14-38 and 42-53 were reduced fastest followed marginally by 54-59, and then bond 3-21.

518850|a|Studies are presented of the equilibrium binding of [3H]-d-tubocurarine (dTC) and [3H]acetylcholine (AcCh) to Torpedo postsynaptic membranes. The saturable binding of [3H]dTC is characterized by two affinities: Kd1 = 33 +/- 6 nM and Kd2 = 7.7 +/- 4.6 microM, with equal numbers of binding sites. Both components are completely inhibited by pretreatment with excess alpha-bungarotoxin or 100 microM nonradioactive dTC and competitively inhibited by carbamylcholine with a KI = 100 nM, but not affected by the local anesthetics dimethisoquin, proadifen, and meproadifen. The biphasic nature of [3H]dTC binding was unaltered in solutions of low ionic strength and by preparation of Torpedo membranes in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide, a treatment which yields dimeric AcCJ receptors. dTC competitively inhibits the binding of [3H]AcCH and decreases the fluorescence of 1-(5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonamido)ethane-2-trimethylammonium (Dns-Chol) in a manner quantitatively consistent with its directly measured binding properties. It decreases the initial rate of 3H-labeled Naja nigricollis alpha-toxin binding by 50% at 60 nM with an apparent Hill coefficient of 0.58. The stoichiometry of total dTC, AcCh, and alpha-neurotoxin binding sites in Torpedo membranes was determined by radiochemical techniques and by a novel fluorescence assay utilizing Dns-Chol as an indicator, yielding ratios of 0.9 +/- 0.1:0.9 +/- 0.2:1, respectively. The biphasic equilibrium binding function is not unique to dTC since other ligands inhibited [3h]acCh binding in a biphasic manner with apparent inhibition constants as follows: gallamine triethiodide (K11 = 2 microM, K12 = 1 mM); Me2dTC (K11 = 500 nM, K12 = 10 microM); decamethonium (K11 = 100 nM, K12 = 1.6 microM). Carbamylcholine, however, inhibited [3H]AcCh binding with a single KI = 100 nM. The observed competition between those ligands and [3H] AcCh cannot be completely accounted for by competitive interaction with two different affinities, and the deviations are discussed in terms of the positive cooperativity of the [3H] AcCh binding function itself. It is concluded that dTC binds only to the AcCh sites in Torpedo membranes and that those sites display two affinities for dTC but only one for AcCh.

3756139|a|The structural basis for the heterogeneity of the two agonist binding sites of the Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor with respect to antagonist binding and reactivity toward affinity alkylating reagents was investigated. There is one agonist binding site on each of the two alpha subunits in a receptor monomer. One of these sites is easily affinity labeled with bromoacetylcholine, while more extreme conditions are required to label the other. Evidence is presented that the site which is easily labeled with bromoacetylcholine is the site with higher affinity for the antagonist d-tubocurarine. Digestion of purified alpha subunits with staphylococcal V8 protease gave two limit fragments with apparent molecular weights of 17K and 19K. Both of these fragments began at residue 46 of the alpha sequence, and both reacted with monoclonal antibodies specific for the sequence alpha 152-159 but not with antibodies specific for alpha 235-242. Their tryptic peptide maps and reactivity with a number of monoclonal antibodies were virtually identical. Only the 17-kilodalton (17-kDa) fragments stained heavily for sugars with Schiff's reagent. However, both fragments bound 125I-labeled concanavalin A. Complete removal of carbohydrate detectable with concanavalin A from V8 protease digests of alpha subunits resulted in two fragments of lower apparent molecular weights, indicating that these fragments differed not only in carbohydrate content but also in their C-termini or by another covalent modification. Covalent labeling of one of the two agonist sites of the intact receptor with bromo[3H]acetylcholine followed by digestion with V8 protease resulted in labeling of only the 19-kDa fragment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

3134197|a|Removal of asparagine-linked carbohydrate chains from Torpedo marmorata electric organ membranes was found to inhibit the binding of the iodinated alpha-neurotoxin I from Naja mossambica mossambica snake venom to its receptor. Optimal deglycosylation of membranes by endoglycosidase F resulted in a 55% inhibition of alpha-neurotoxin-I-saturable binding. Under these conditions, up to 70% of concanavalin A binding was also lost, indicating an efficient removal of mannose-rich carbohydrate chains. Saturation binding experiments at equilibrium on membranes incubated in the absence of endoglycosidase F indicated, when analyzed by Scatchard plots, the presence of two classes of high-affinity binding sites for alpha-neurotoxin I (kd = 9 pM and 68 pM respectively) with capacities of 24 and 14 pmol/mg membrane proteins, respectively. After endoglycosidase F treatment, only the former class of binding sites (Kd = 11 pM) was recovered together with a 45% reduction in the number of total binding sites. Dissociation experiments further confirmed the presence of two types of toxin-receptor complexes in control membranes and the selective loss of the rapidly dissociating component upon deglycosylation. The binding of alpha-neurotoxin I to its receptor, deglycosylated or not, was totally inhibited by carbamoylcholine, d-tubocurarine or alpha-bungarotoxin. These findings show that the neurotoxin binding sites present on the acetylcholine receptor can be discriminated on the basis of their differential susceptibility to the removal of asparagine-linked carbohydrate chains.

2426778|a|The 2.8 A resolution three-dimensional structure of a complex between an antigen (lysozyme) and the Fab fragment from a monoclonal antibody against lysozyme has been determined and refined by x-ray crystallographic techniques. No conformational changes can be observed in the tertiary structure of lysozyme compared with that determined in native crystalline forms. The quaternary structure of Fab is that of an extended conformation. The antibody combining site is a rather flat surface with protuberances and depressions formed by its amino acid side chains. The antigen-antibody interface is tightly packed, with 16 lysozyme and 17 antibody residues making close contacts. The antigen contacting residues belong to two stretches of the lysozyme polypeptide chain: residues 18 to 27 and 116 to 129. All the complementarity-determining regions and two residues outside hypervariable positions of the antibody make contact with the antigen. Most of these contacts (10 residues out of 17) are made by the heavy chain, and in particular by its third complementarity-determining region. Antigen variability and antibody specificity and affinity are discussed on the basis of the determined structure.

3611197|a|The binding sites on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of labels specific for the alpha-, beta-, and delta-subunits were determined by electron image analysis, using tubular crystals of receptors grown from the postsynaptic membranes of Torpedo marmorata electric organ. The labels were alpha-bungarotoxin (which attaches to the acetylcholine binding sites on the pair of alpha-subunits), Fab35 (a monoclonal antibody Fab fragment directed against the main immunogenic region of the alpha-subunit), Fab111 (a monoclonal antibody Fab fragment directed against a cytoplasmic site on the beta-subunit), and wheat germ agglutinin (which binds to N-acetylglucosamine residues on the delta-subunit). These labels, bound to receptors in the crystals, were located by comparing labeled with native structures, averaged in each case over more than 5,000 molecules. From the assignments made, we find that the clockwise arrangement of subunits around the receptor, viewed from the synaptic face, is: alpha, beta, alpha, gamma, and delta; that the main immunogenic region is at (or close to) the side of the alpha-subunit; and that the two acetylcholine binding sites are at the synaptic end of the alpha-subunits, 27-28 A from the central axis and approximately 53 A apart. In the crystal lattice, neighboring molecules are paired so that their delta- and alpha-subunits are juxtaposed, an organization that appears to relate closely to the grouping of receptors in vivo.

3382627|a|The acetylcholine-binding sites on the native, membrane-bound acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo marmorata were covalently labeled with the photoaffinity reagent [3H]-p-(dimethylamino)-benzenediazonium fluoroborate (DDF) in the presence of phencyclidine by employing an energy-transfer photolysis procedure. The alpha-chains isolated from receptor-rich membranes photolabeled in the absence or presence of carbamoylcholine were cleaved with CNBr and the radiolabeled fragments purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid and/or sequence analysis demonstrated that the alpha-chain residues Trp-149, Tyr-190, Cys-192, and Cys-193 and an unidentified residue(s) in the segment alpha 31-105 were all labeled by the photoaffinity reagent in an agonist-protectable manner. The labeled amino acids are located within three distinct regions of the large amino-terminal hydrophilic domain of the alpha-subunit primary structure and plausibly lie in proximity to one another at the level of the acetylcholine-binding sites in the native receptor. These findings are in accord with models proposed for the transmembrane topology of the alpha-chain that assign the amino-terminal segment alpha 1-210 to the synaptic cleft. Furthermore, the results suggest that the four identified [3H]DDF-labeled residues, which are conserved in muscle and neuronal alpha-chains but not in the other subunits, may be directly involved in agonist binding.

6088547|a|Recently the purified alpha-subunit from Torpedo marmorata acetylcholine receptor was shown to bind alpha-bungarotoxin with a KD approximately 3 nM in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (Tzartos, S.J., and Changeux, J.P. (1983) EMBO J. 2, 381-387). Here we describe a further significant step toward renaturation of the alpha-subunit as judged by toxin and monoclonal antibody binding. Purified T. marmorata receptor subunits were diluted with 1% lipids (asolectin) plus 0.5% Na+ cholate. An anion-exchange resin eliminated most of the detergents, leaving approximately 0.1% Na+ cholate and the lipids. After this treatment, about 20% of the alpha-subunit recovered (but not the beta-, gamma-, or delta-subunit) exhibited a high affinity for radioiodinated alpha-bungarotoxin with a KD approximately 0.5 nM. The 34,000- and 27,000-dalton proteolytic peptides of the alpha-subunit conserved this lipid-dependent toxin binding. Unlabeled alpha-toxins, hexamethonium, and carbamylcholine competed with alpha-bungarotoxin for the renatured alpha-subunit. Noncompetitive channel blockers doubled the lipid-dependent toxin-binding capacity of the alpha-subunit but had no effect on the 27,000-dalton peptide. The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to the main immunogenic region (which is particularly sensitive to denaturation) significantly increased. In particular, binding of antibody 16 changed from 1% to denatured to 100% to the lipid-renaturated alpha-subunit. The binding of these antibodies was lost with the lipid-renatured 34,000- and 27,000-dalton peptides.

518854|a|Photolabile derivatives of [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin that retain specific binding to Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor have been utilized as structural probes of the receptor complex of polypeptide components in its membrane-associated form. The derivatized toxins contained aryl azide side chains poised to form covalent cross-links to both associated and adjacent polypeptides following toxin-receptor complex formation. The results demonstrate that, depending on the possible radius of extension of the photoactivated group from the parent toxin, either (1) both the polypeptide to which the toxin derivative binds and an adjacent polypeptide can be derivatized upon photolysis or (2) only the adjacent polypeptide is labeled. The results lend strong support to the notion that the nicotinic receptor from T. california is composed of a complex of different polypeptides.

We used this reagent to label the receptor in membranes from Torpedo electric organ and rat muscle and have analyzed the labeled polypeptides by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Reaction of the modified toxin with the Torpedo receptor in situ covalently labels the same four polypeptides as seen in Torpedo receptor preparations after solubilization and purification. The toxin derivative labels five polypeptides in muscle membranes that correspond in molecular weight to the subunits of the purified muscle receptor. These results provide evidence that, for both Torpedo and muscle receptors, the polypeptides associated with the purified protein also form part of the receptor in situ.

3995011|a|[3H]Methyl-alpha-neurotoxin prereacted with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DTSP) can be covalently linked to each of the subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in membranes from the electric tissue of Torpedo californica. Pronounced changes in the cross-linking pattern are observed upon prior incubation with receptor specific ligands and upon reduction and/or alkylation of the receptor. d-Tubocurarine has been shown to bind to two different sites in receptor-rich membranes. These sites are present in equal numbers but have different affinities [Neubig, R. R., & Cohen, J. B. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 5464-5475; Sine, S., & Taylor, P. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6692-6699]. Using d-tubocurarine inhibition of [3H]-methyl-alpha-neurotoxin binding, we demonstrate two inhibitory constants for d-tubocurarine of 67 +/- 21 nM and 4.9 +/- 1.7 microM in unreduced membranes. We utilize the large difference in Ki's to preferentially block toxin cross-linking at the high affinity site for d-tubocurarine. Low concentrations of this competitive antagonist selectively block the cross-linking of toxin to the beta and gamma subunits of the receptor, suggesting that these subunits are located close to the toxin binding site which is also the high-affinity binding site for d-tubocurarine. Reduction of disulfide bonds alters the affinity of the receptor for alpha-neurotoxin. Alterations are also seen in the cross-linking pattern of DTSP-activated [3H]methyl-alpha-neurotoxin to reduced and alkylated membranes in the presence of tubocurarine. The constants for d-tubocurarine inhibition of [3H]methyl-alpha-neurotoxin binding to reduced and alkylated membranes are 172 +/- 52 nM and 2.4 +/- 0.4 microM. The effects of bromoacetylcholine, carbamoylcholine, gallamine, and procaine on the cross-linking pattern are also examined. Our observations are consistent with an arrangement of the subunits in the membrane of alpha beta alpha gamma delta.

44174|a|A relatively shorttime ago the individual neuron was viewed as functioning by means of the simple summation of brief inhibitory or excitatory events. The complexity of the nervous system was the outcome largely of the connections between neurons. Recent studies have uncovered a new set of phenomena that indicate that relatively complex information processing may occur at the level of the individual neuron. For example, rather than producing additive effects, synaptic inputs can produce multiplicative effects that serve to alter the gain of the system. In addition, synaptic inputs may be able to alter specific classes of other inputs selectively. One could envision that each class of synaptic input to a cell could be selectively depressed or enhanced by a corresponding modulatory input. Since the modulatory actions can be transmitted intracellularly via second messengers, an extensive array of presynaptic connections may be unnecessary. It remains to be determined which of the modulatory phenomena currently reviewed are functionally important and which are only pharmacological or experimental curiosities. Are there any common attributes of the various synaptic phenomena that have been termed modulatory? The most common features of modulatory synaptic effects are long-duration of action and contingent action. Contingent action refers to the property that modulatory transmitters often have little or no effects in themselves, but instead they alter the effects of other events. Long-duration and contingent action endow modulatory effects with properties ideally suited to the control of behavioral modulations such as learning, motivational state, arousal, and sensitization. While there is no necessary connection between behavioral modulation and neural modulation, the available evidence from invertebrates suggests that there often is a connection. It is likely that examples of neuromodulation in vertebrates also will be tied to behavioral modulation.

839456|a|1. The effect of adrenaline on the Ca-dependent slow inward current, Is, of mammalian cardiac muscle has been investigated by the voltage-clamp method. The mechanism of the increase in the conductance, gs, was analysed on the basis of a kinetic scheme (Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952) applicable to this system. 2. The rate constants alphad and betad, of activation of gs were not influenced by adrenaline, although the limiting conductance, gs, was greatly increased. 3. Reduction of [Ca]o from 1-8 to 0-2 mM decreased the amplitude of inward tail currents when gs was fully activated; however, the relative decrease of the current amplitude was the same with and without adrenaline. The reversal potential, ER, of Is was not changed by the drug. This indicates that the catecholamine has no influence on the selectivity of these conductance channels. 4. An increase in the number of functional conductance channels by adrenaline is discussed as a possible mechanism for the increase in Gs.

6118434|a|Several neurotransmitters including noradrenaline (NA), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin (5-HT), and also certain peptides, decrease the duration of the Na+-Ca2+ action potential recorded in cell bodies of embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion neurones maintained in cell culture. To determine if these agents decreased action potential duration by affecting Ca2+ channels (inward current) or K+ channels (outward current) membrane currents were recorded in voltage-clamped sensory neurone somata. 1. Depolarization produced a prominent inward Na+ current and a smaller and slower inward Ca2+ current (ICa). The inactivation of ICa was not simply dependent on membrane potential but apparently required prior entry of Ca2+. Two components of outward current, voltage-activated and Ca2+-activated, were evident in most cells. 2. The effect of NA, and also of GABA and 5-HT, was shown to result from a direct effect on ICa because: NA decreased the TTX-resistant tail current recorded at EK and also the inward current recorded in the presence of 125 mM-TEA and TTX (in which Na+ and K+ currents were blocked). 3. The decrease in ICa is most likely due to an effect on the number of available Ca2+ channels and/or the single Ca2+ channel conductance rather than to a shift in either the kinetics of channel activation or the Ca2+ equilibrium potential. 4. No effect of the several transmitters on the voltage-dependent Na+ and K+ currents was observed. 5. Implications of ICa modulation for the phenomenon of presynaptic inhibition are discussed.

559758|a|1. The directly evoked action potential of dissociated, embryonic, chick, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones maintained in cell culture is prolonged compared to spinal cord cell spikes and the re-polarization phase is marked by a plateau. 2. Evidence was obtained that both Ca2+ and Na+ carry inward current across the active soma membrane. Ca2+ because: overshooting spikes persist in tetrodotoxin (TTX) or Na+-free media; in the presence of TTX (or absence of Na+) spike size varies directly with extracellular Ca2+ and spikes are eliminated by Co2+. Na+ because: spikes persist in the presence of Co2+ or Ca2+-free media; in the presence of Co2+ (or absence of Ca2+) spike varies directly with extracellular Na+ and spikes are blocked by TTX. 3. On the other hand, Ca2+ plays less if any role in action potentials conducted along sensory nerve cell processes. Conducted spikes could not be evoked in TTX containing or Na+-free media. 4. A long-lasting depolarization follows the action potential in some neurones. This depolarization is associated with an increase in membrane conductance and appears to drive the membrane potential to ca. -30mV. It persists when conducted impulses are blocked so it is probably not a recurrent synaptic potential. 5. It is suggested that combined Ca2+-Na+ spikes observed in isolated sensory neurones in vitro reflect the action potential of adult sensory cells but the possibility that they represent an early stage in development is also discussed.

6323430|a|Treatment of membranes with islet activating protein (IAP), a toxin from Bordetella pertussis, results in abolition of GTP-dependent, receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase. This appears to result from IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of a 41,000-Da membrane-bound protein. A protein with 41,000- and 35,000-Da subunits has been purified from rabbit liver membranes as the predominant substrate for IAP. This protein has now been shown to be capable of regulating membrane-bound adenylate cyclase activity of human platelets under various conditions. The characteristics of the actions of the IAP substrate are as follows. 1) Purified 41,000/35,000-Da dimer is capable of restoring the inhibitory effects of guanine nucleotides and the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, epinephrine, on the adenylate cyclase activity of IAP-treated membranes. 2) The subunits of the dimer dissociate in the presence of guanine nucleotide analogs or A1(3+), Mg2+, and F-. The 41,000-Da subunit has a high affinity binding site for guanine nucleotides. 3) The resolved 35,000-Da subunit of the dimer mimics guanine nucleotide- and epinephrine-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase. 4) The resolved (unliganded) 41,000-Da subunit stimulates adenylate cyclase activity and relieves guanine nucleotide- +/- epinephrine-induced inhibition of the enzyme. In contrast, the GTP gamma S-bound form of the 41,000-Da subunit inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, although with lower apparent affinity than does the 35,000-Da subunit. 5) The 35,000-Da subunit increases the rate of deactivation of Gs, the stimulatory regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, the 41,000-Da subunit can interact with Gs and inhibit its deactivation. These data strongly suggest that the IAP substrate is another dimeric, guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein and that it is responsible for inhibitory modulation of adenylate cyclase activity.

2417236|a|The diacylglycerol analogue 1,2-oleoylacetylglycerol (OAG) and the phorbol ester 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate (DPB) were tested for their effects on the voltage-dependent calcium (Ca) current in embryonic chicken dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro. OAG (0.6-60 microM) and DPB (0.01-50 microM) produced reversible decreases in Ca current. Neither drug affected resting membrane conductance, the voltage-dependent potassium current, or the Ca current-voltage relationship. The concentrations of OAG and DPB that reduced Ca current correlate well with those concentrations that have been shown, in other systems, to activate protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation. The time course for OAG action on Ca current is also consistent with an involvement of kinase C. Incubation of dorsal root ganglion cells in 60 microM OAG prevented further reductions in Ca current by either 50 microM DPB or 10 microM norepinephrine, a known modulator of the voltage-dependent Ca channel in these cells. This evidence suggests that protein kinase C may play a role in modulating Ca channel function.

6270629|a|1. The extracellular patch clamp method, which first allowed the detection of single channel currents in biological membranes, has been further refined to enable higher current resolution, direct membrane patch potential control, and physical isolation of membrane patches. 2. A description of a convenient method for the fabrication of patch recording pipettes is given together with procedures followed to achieve giga-seals i.e. pipette-membrane seals with resistances of 10(9) - 10(11) omega. 3. The basic patch clamp recording circuit, and designs for improved frequency response are described along with the present limitations in recording the currents from single channels. 4. Procedures for preparation and recording from three representative cell types are given. Some properties of single acetylcholine-activated channels in muscle membrane are described to illustrate the improved current and time resolution achieved with giga-seals. 5. A description is given of the various ways that patches of membrane can be physically isolated from cells. This isolation enables the recording of single channel currents with well-defined solutions on both sides of the membrane. Two types of isolated cell-free patch configurations can be formed: an inside-out patch with its cytoplasmic membrane face exposed to the bath solution, and an outside-out patch with its extracellular membrane face exposed to the bath solution. 6. The application of the method for the recording of ionic currents and internal dialysis of small cells is considered. Single channel resolution can be achieved when recording from whole cells, if the cell diameter is small (less than 20 micrometer). 7. The wide range of cell types amenable to giga-seal formation is discussed.

489575|a|Previous work suggested that hormonal activation of adenylate cyclase involves the introduction of GTP to the regulatory site, and subsequent hydrolysis of the bound GTP terminates the activation. In many tissues the turn-off GTPase reaction cannot be readily measured because of a high background of nonspecific GTP hydrolysis. To circumvent this problem a general assay for the turn-off reaction has now been developed. The adenylate cyclase is first activated by hormone and GTP and the introduction of GTP is then stopped either by addition of an excess of guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) or by addition of a receptor blocking agent. The decay of adenylate cyclase activity brought on by these inhibitors is used to calculate the rate constant of the turn-off reaction. In turkey erythrocyte and rat parotid membranes the rate constant of the decay process as determined with GDP beta S is similar to that determined with the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. The rate constants (min-1 at 30 degrees C) for various adenylate cyclase preparations are 10 for turkey erythrocyte, 7.5 for rat parotid, and 6.2 for the rat liver enzyme. The finding of similar rate constants in the various preparations indicates that GTP hydrolysis at the regulatory site is a general mechanism for terminating the activation of adenylate cyclase.

6301820|a|Epinephrine inhibits human platelet adenylate cyclase by an alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated and GTP-dependent process. The turn-off reaction for this epinephrine-inhibited enzyme was studied by measuring the rate of cyclic AMP formation upon addition of the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, or upon addition of an excess of the stable GDP analog, guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S), which competitively inhibited the action of GTP in the epinephrine-induced inhibition. The decay of the inhibited state of the adenylate cyclase was used to calculate the rate constant of the turn-off reaction. With both methods, almost identical koff values of 0.6-0.7 min-1 at 25 degrees C were obtained for the epinephrine-inhibited platelet enzyme. Cholera toxin, which does not inhibit the epinephrine-induced GTPase stimulation in platelet membranes, did not affect this turn-off reaction. In contrast, the turn-off rate of the prostaglandin-E1-stimulated human platelet adenylate cyclase, measured with GDP beta S, was reduced from about 9 min-1 to 2 min-1 at 25 degrees C by pretreatment of the membranes with cholera toxin, which inhibits the prostaglandin-E1-stimulated GTPase activity. The data strongly suggest that the guanine nucleotide regulatory site, mediating epinephrine-induced adenylate cyclase inhibition, is activated and inactivated by similar mechanisms as is the site mediating adenylate cyclase stimulation, and that cholera toxin affects only the stimulatory site. The findings furthermore suggest that the activity states of these two regulatory sites control the activity of the adenylate cyclase.

6325583|a|The effects of the adenylate cyclase inhibitor GDP beta S on the response of Aplysia neuron R15 to serotonin (5HT) were investigated. Previous studies have demonstrated that 5HT causes an increase in K+ conductance in R15 and that the response is mediated by cAMP. At concentrations in the micromolar range, GDP beta S inhibits the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by 5HT in particulate fractions from Aplysia ganglia. When micromolar concentrations of GDP beta S are injected into neuron R15, there is no effect on the resting membrane conductance, but the increase in K+ conductance normally elicited by 5HT is completely inhibited. Furthermore, the decrease in inward current normally elicited by dopamine (DA), which does not appear to involve cAMP, is not affected by micromolar concentrations of GDP beta S. In addition, application of 8-benzylthio cAMP to R15 can evoke an increase in K+ conductance even after the injection of GDP beta S, which indicates that events subsequent to the activation of adenylate cyclase are not inhibited by the GDP analogue. In contrast, when millimolar concentrations of GDP beta S are injected into R15, direct effects on membrane conductance are observed and the response of R15 to 5HT is enhanced. Although these effects of high concentrations of GDP beta S are only poorly understood, the results with micromolar concentrations are consistent with the hypothesis that stimulation of adenylate cyclase is necessary for the 5HT-induced increase in K+ conductance in neuron R15.

6146365|a|The effects of noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine were investigated on the duration of the action potential of embryonic chick sensory neurones in vitro. All three amines, like gamma-aminobutyric acid, decreased the duration of the action potential evoked by current injection. The onset of the noradrenaline-induced decrease in action potential duration was fast (less than 1s) and the recovery phase was dependent upon the dose of noradrenaline applied. Rapid washout of the noradrenaline revealed a minimum 30s recovery time which was independent of the initial noradrenaline concentration. Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine could mimic the effects of noradrenaline on action potential duration. The ED50 for all three amines was approximately 1 microM. At a saturating concentration of 10 microM, noradrenaline was more potent than dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Saturating doses of noradrenaline and dopamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine were not additive. Responses to all three amines were affected similarly by antagonists: they were antagonized by yohimbine, phentolamine, haloperidol and mianserin but not by propranolol, prazosin, domperidone, spiperone or methysergide. Clonidine and xylazine (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists) were also without effect. In contrast to the amines, saturating concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid were additive with those of noradrenaline. Responses to GABA were not antagonized by the amine receptor antagonists. The evidence described here suggests that the amines and gamma-aminobutyric acid acid decrease sensory neurone action potential duration via pharmacologically-distinct membrane receptors. In addition, it is likely that the amines are acting via a single class of receptor whose pharmacology is different from classical adrenoceptors, dopamine receptors and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors.

6271320|a|1 Embryonic sensory neurones of the chick grown in dissociated cell culture respond to application of low concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with a change in resting membrane resistance (R(in)) and/or a change in action potential duration (APD) (Dunlap & Fischbach, 1978; Choi & Fischbach, 1981). Intracellular microelectrode recording techniques were employed to determine if these two effects are mediated by the same, or different, GABA receptors.2 Cells responded, for the most part, with a change in either R(in) or APD, but 10% of the cells exhibited both effects. In the latter cells the two responses were clearly distinguishable as discussed below.3 The proportion of neurones exhibiting a GABA-induced decrease in R(in) declined during the first week in vitro while the proportion exhibiting a decrease in APD increased during that time.4 The two effects were pharmacologically distinct. Muscimol, a GABA analogue, produced only the change in R(in) (ED(50) = 5.5 muM) while baclofen, another analogue of GABA, produced only the change in APD (ED(50) = 1 muM). The analogues were approximately equipotent with GABA. Bicuculline, a GABA antagonist, blocked the muscimol-induced change in R(in) (but not the baclofen-induced change in APD) in a dose-dependent fashion with an ID(50) = 0.7 muM.5 The time courses of the two effects were different. The change in APD resulting from a brief application of GABA (or baclofen) was prolonged relative to the rapid return to control associated with the GABA- (or muscimol-) induced change in R(in).6 Desensitization of the two responses exhibited separate time courses. In the continual presence of the agonists, GABA- and muscimol-induced decreases in R(in) completely desensitized in ca. 10 s while GABA- and baclofen-induced decreases in APD persisted undiminished throughout a prolonged (1 min) application of the drugs and returned to control only after cessation of application.7 It is concluded that embryonic chick sensory neurones in culture exhibit two types of GABA receptor that differ in their functional and pharmacological properties. Implications of these results are discussed.

33989|a|(-)-Norepinephrine and other catecholamines inhibit basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities by 35 to 60% in homogenates of NG108-15 neuroblastoma x gloma hybrid cells and markedly reduce adenosine 3'35:'-monophosphate levels of intact cells, but do not affect guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels. The specificity of the NG108-15 receptor for ligands is that of an alpha receptor, possibly a presynaptic alpha 2 receptor. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase by norepinephrine is reversed by alpha receptor antagonists such as dihydroergotamine or phentolamine, but not by the beta receptor antagonist propranolol. The effect of norepinephrine on adenylate cyclase activity initially is dependent on GTP; half-maximal inhibition of enzyme activity by norepinephrine is obtained with 0.2 micron GTP. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by norepinephrine is reduced by 10 mM NaF and is abolished by 0.05 mM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. Inhibitions of NG108-15 adenylate cyclase mediated by alpha receptors, opiate receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are not additive; this suggests that the three species of receptors can be functionally coupled to the same adenylate cyclase molecules or molecules regulating the enzyme.

6323949|a|Baclofen and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are shown to inhibit basal adenylate cyclase activity in brain of rat. The response is mediated through the GABAB receptor, and the rank order of potency for agonists is (-)-baclofen (EC50 = 4 microM) greater than GABA (EC50 = 17 microM) greater than muscimol greater than (+)-baclofen. GABAA agonists are not effective inhibitors of cyclase activity. The response is bicuculline-insensitive, and diazepam does not modify the GABA or (-)-baclofen inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Studies with neurologically mutant mice correlated a loss in GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition of cyclase with a loss in cerebellar granule cells. Thus, the GABAB receptor is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase in various brain areas, and, in the cerebellum, data suggest a granule cell localization of this activity.

6162842|a|Free cells isolated from adult rat heart by the collagenase method were maintained in culture up to 21 h with or without an islet-activating protein (IAP) that had been purified from the culture medium of Bordetella pertussis. Short-term stimulation of beta-adrenergic or glucagon receptors in these cultured cells caused more accumulation of cAMP in cells precultured with IAP (IAP-treated) than in nontreated cells, although there was no significant difference in the baseline (non-stimulated) content of cAMP between these cells. Stimulation of muscarinic cholinergic or adenosine R-site receptors caused a marked inhibition of cAMP accumulation in nontreated cells in either the presence or absence of a beta-agonist (or glucagon); no such inhibition was essentially observed in IAP-treated cells. These actions of IAP developed gradually and were dose-dependent with the half-maximal concentration of approximately 80 ng/ml in culture. It is concluded that IAP may exert its unique influence on the heart cell membrane causing profound modification of the coupling mechanism involved in the receptor-mediated activation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase. This action of IAP differs clearly from that of cholera toxin which activates adenylate cyclase rather independently of the receptor functions in heart cells.

6086607|a|The D-2 dopamine receptor mediates inhibition of adenylate cyclase in rat intermediate lobe; this receptor is linked to cyclase by the inhibitory guanyl nucleotide-binding protein (Ni). The functioning of components in the inhibitory system was compared in control and pertussis toxin-treated tissues. (-)-N-n-Propylnorapomorphine ((-)-NPA), a dopamine agonist, and 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase in control tissue. Pertussis toxin abolished dopamine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase but did not alter Gpp(NH)p-induced inhibition of cyclase. In control tissue, GTP blocked Gpp(NH)p inhibition of cyclase in the absence, but not in the presence of (-)-NPA. Following pertussis toxin treatment, GTP blocked the inhibitory effect of Gpp(NH)p either in the absence or in the presence of (-)-NPA. Pertussis toxin did not alter the number of dopamine receptors or the affinity of the receptor for [3H]spiroperidol, a dopamine antagonist. However, pertussis toxin decreased the potency of (-)-NPA in the binding assay and abolished the ability of GTP to affect agonist binding. Furthermore, pertussis toxin abolished the dopamine receptor-mediated inhibition of immunoreactive alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone release, and induced the ADP-ribosylation of the Mr = 41,000 subunit of Ni.

2582078|a|Modulation of voltage-dependent Ca channels by norepinephrine (NE) was studied in chick dorsal root ganglion cells using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Cells dialyzed with K+ and 2-10 mM EGTA exhibited Ca action potentials that were reversibly decreased in duration and amplitude by NE. Ca channel currents were isolated from other channel contributions by using: (a) tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block gNa, (b) internal K channel impermeant ions (Cs or Na/N-methylglucamine mixtures) as K substitutes, (c) external tetraethylammonium (TEA) to block K channels, (d) internal EGTA to reduce possible current contribution from Ca-activated channels. A marked decline (rundown) of Ca conductance was observed during continual dialysis, which obscured reversible NE effects. The addition of 2-5 mM MgATP to the intracellular solutions greatly retarded Ca channel rundown and permitted a clear assessment of modulatory drug effects. The inclusion of an intracellular creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase nucleotide regeneration system further stabilized Ca channels, which permitted recording of Ca currents for up to 3 h. NE reversibly decreased both steady state Ca currents and Ca tail currents in Cs/EGTA/MgATP-dialyzed cells. A possible role of several putative intracellular second messengers in NE receptor-Ca channel coupling was investigated. Cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP added to the intracellular solutions at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than the Kd for activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases did not block or mask the expression of the NE-mediated decrease in gCa. Addition of internal EGTA to a final concentration of 10 mM also did not affect the expression of the NE response. These results suggest that neither cyclic AMP nor cyclic GMP nor Ca is acting as a second messenger coupling the NE receptor to the down-modulated Ca channel population.

6150041|a|Hormonal inhibition of adenylate cyclase is mediated by a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ni) which is different from the one which mediates hormonal stimulation. There is substantial evidence that the active component of Ni (termed alpha i can be ADP-ribosylated by a toxin from Bordetella pertussis. We have found that in bovine cerebral cortex there are three proteins of similar molecular weight (39,000-41,000) which are modified by pertussis toxin. We have purified these proteins and have resolved the 41,000-dalton protein from the 40,000/39,000-dalton doublet. All three forms of pertussis toxin substrate can be isolated in free form or together with a 36,000 beta component. We have also purified this beta component. ADP-ribosylation of the three pertussis toxin substrates is greatly enhanced by the addition of the purified beta component. This makes possible an assay of beta subunit activity based on its interaction with alpha i. The three forms of pertussis toxin substrate which we have purified differ in two functions: susceptibility to ADP-ribosylation and GTPase activity. The 41,000-dalton protein is more readily ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin than the smaller forms. The 39,000-dalton protein has GTPase activity with a low Km (0.3 microM) for GTP. The GTPase activity can be doubled by phospholipids. The GTPase activity of the 41,000-dalton protein is almost undetectable. It is not yet known what the relationship of the forms is to each other. The smaller forms may be derived from the larger by proteolysis or it may be intrinsically different. It remains to be shown whether one of the forms represents a different type of regulatory protein which transmits a hormonal signal to effectors other than adenylate cyclase.

6438083|a|Membranes from bovine brain bind relatively large quantities of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) with high affinity. The two proteins responsible for most of this activity were purified; they account for 1.5% of the membrane protein. The two proteins contain alpha subunits of either 39,000 or 41,000 Da, beta subunits of 36,000 or 35,000 Da, and a potential gamma subunit (11,000 Da). These structures are the same as a family of proteins that includes transducin and the regulatory proteins, GS and GI, of adenylate cyclase. The 41,000- and 39,000-Da polypeptides can be ADP-ribosylated with islet-activating protein from Bordetella pertussis, bind guanine nucleotides specifically, and migrate through polyacrylamide gels with rates similar to the alpha subunits of GI and transducin, respectively. The 36,000- and 35,000-Da polypeptides are similar to the beta subunits of GI and GS. The gamma subunit is found whenever beta subunits are present. The 41,000- and 39,000-Da polypeptides (with beta and gamma) are designated, respectively, GI and GO from brain. The alpha subunit of GO was isolated without the use of ligands known to dissociate other G proteins. GO alpha binds GTP gamma S reversibly in the absence of Mg2+ and is relatively stable in cholate. This isolated alpha subunit should be of great utility in elucidating the mechanism of action of this family of GTP-binding proteins.

2579078|a|Incubation of rat mast cells with compound 48/80 resulted in transient breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, rapid generation of inositol polyphosphates, 45Ca inflow, and the arachidonic acid liberation mainly from phosphatidylcholine, eventually leading to histamine secretion. All of these processes of signaling from Ca-mobilizing receptors to degranulation were markedly inhibited by prior 2-h exposure of cells to islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin. A23187 caused 45Ca inflow and releases of arachidonic acid and histamine without inducing breakdown of inositol phospholipids. The effects of A23187, in contrast to those of compound 48/80, were not altered by the exposure of cells to IAP. Incubation of the supernatant fraction of mast cell homogenates with the active component of IAP caused the transfer of the ADP-ribosyl moiety of added [alpha-32P]NAD to a protein with Mr = 41,000. The IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of this protein was prevented by guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, indicating that this IAP substrate resembles, in character, the alpha-subunit of the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ni) involved in inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The degree of ADP-ribosylation of this IAP substrate was prevented progressively by pre-exposure of the homogenate-donor cells to increasing concentrations of IAP. The half-maximally effective concentrations of the toxin were 0.2 to 0.6 ng/ml for all the IAP-sensitive processes studied. Thus, the ADP-ribosylation of the Mr = 41,000 protein occurring during exposure of cells to IAP appears to be responsible for the inhibition of signaling observed. It is proposed that the alpha-subunit of Ni, or a like protein, mediates signal transduction arising from Ca-mobilizing receptors, probably prior to Ca2+ gating.

3157993|a|Addition of pertussis toxin to rabbit neutrophils inhibits the fMet-Leu-Phe- induced increases in Na+ influx and in intracellular pH. In addition, pretreatment of the cells with the toxin inhibits the decrease in the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and the enhanced production of phosphatidic acid produced by the chemotactic factor fMet-Leu-Phe. Furthermore, the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced changes in the phosphorylation of a 46-kDa protein and of several other proteins are also inhibited by the toxin. On the other hand, the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced increases in the phosphorylation of several proteins are not inhibited by the toxin. PMA, but not its inactive analogue 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, was also found to stimulate Na+ influx and to increase the intracellular pH in rabbit neutrophils. These ionic effects, like those produced by fMet-Leu-Phe, are inhibited by amiloride. The stimulated Na+ influx and H+ efflux produced by the phorbol ester, on the other hand, are not inhibited by pertussis toxin. The results reported here suggest that the activity of the Na+/H+ antiport in neutrophils is regulated by protein kinase C; that the G-protein system, either directly or indirectly, is involved in the stimulus-response coupling sequence in these cells; and that the toxin acts at, or prior to, the steps responsible for the activation of phospholipase C, and it does not affect the sequence of reactions initiated by the activation of the protein kinase C.

2986003|a|Interaction of ligands with 'Ca2+-mobilizing' receptors is thought to result in the generation of two second messengers, inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, from a common substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) (refs 1, 2), a component of plasma membranes. It is not known how the occupation of such receptors is translated into the activation of the catalytic unit polyphosphoinositide (PPI) phosphodiesterase, and then to cellular activation, but our recent experiments suggest that GTP regulatory proteins may be involved. In mast cells, non-hydrolysable analogues of GTP introduced and then trapped in the cytosol are able to substitute for external ligands in inducing exocytosis, a well-defined Ca2+-dependent process, suggesting that guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins may act by stimulating the catalytic activity of the PPI phosphodiesterase. We now provide evidence that mast cell secretion is inhibited by internalized neomycin, a compound known to interact with PPI. We also show that the PPI phosphodiesterase of human neutrophil plasma membranes can be activated simply by adding GTP analogues in the presence of concentrations of Ca2+ that pertain in unstimulated cells. These findings strongly support the idea that the coupling factor linking receptor and PPI phosphodiesterase is a guanine nucleotide binding protein analogous to those involved in the activation and inhibition of adenylate cyclase.

Significant losses of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol phosphate occurred at lower doses of GTP gamma S than did significant loss of phosphatidylinositol. Loss of 32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate was equal when plasma membranes were treated with either 100 microM GTP or 100 microM GTP gamma S, but accumulation of inositol trisphosphate was more apparent when the nonhydrolyzable analogue was used. The action of GTP gamma S alone was not dependent on Ca2+ although loss of 32P-labeled phosphoinositides was stimulated by Ca2+ alone or with GTP gamma S. The results are consistent with a role for guanine nucleotide binding proteins in the activation of membrane-bound phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C.

Tumour-promoting phorbol esters, when intercalated into the cell membrane, may substitute for diacylglycerol and permanently activate protein kinase C. The enzyme probably serves as a receptor for the tumour promoters.

Induction parallels NGF-stimulated PC12 differentiation from a chromaffinlike phenotype to a sympathetic neuronlike phenotype. We report that DNA sequence analysis reveals that clone 73 mRNA encodes an intermediate filament (IF) protein whose predicted amino acid sequence is distinct from the known sequences of other members of the IF protein family. The sequence has highest homology with desmin and vimentin and includes the highly conserved central alpha-helical rod domain with the characteristic heptad repeat of hydrophobic residues, but has lower homology in the amino-terminal head and carboxyl-terminal tail domains. The head domain contains a large number of serine residues which are potential phosphorylation sites. The expression of clone 73 in vivo in the nervous system of the adult rat was investigated by in situ hybridization of clone 73 probes to tissue sections. The mRNA is expressed at high levels in ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, including the superior cervical ganglion (sympathetic), ciliary ganglion (parasympathetic), and dorsal root ganglion (sensory). In the central nervous system, motor nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, V, VI, VII, X, and XII as well as ventral horn motor neurons and a restricted set of other central nervous system nuclei express the clone 73 mRNA. Tissues apart from those of the nervous system did not in general express the mRNA, with only very low levels detected in adrenal gland. We discuss the implications of these results for the mechanism of NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation, the pathways of neuronal development in vivo, and the possible function of the clone 73 IF protein and its relationship to other IF proteins.

2437653|a|GAP-43 is one of a small subset of cellular proteins selectively transported by a neuron to its terminals. Its enrichment in growth cones and its increased levels in developing or regenerating neurons suggest that it has an important role in neurite growth. A complementary DNA (cDNA) that encodes rat GAP-43 has been isolated to study its structural characteristics and regulation. The predicted molecular size is 24 kilodaltons, although its migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gels is anomalously retarded. Expression of GAP-43 is limited to the nervous system, where its levels are highest during periods of neurite outgrowth. Nerve growth factor or adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate induction of neurites from PC12 cells is accompanied by increased GAP-43 expression. GAP-43 RNA is easily detectable, although at diminished levels, in the adult rat nervous system. This regulation of GAP-43 is concordant with a role in growth-related processes of the neuron, processes that may continue in the mature animal.

3422491|a|Differential hybridization of a cDNA library from rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells with cDNA probes from naive PC12 cells and from PC12 cells exposed to nerve growth factor for 7 days identified cDNA sequences of two genes induced by NGF. The mRNA species detected by these cDNA sequences, designated 42A and 42C, reached maximal levels after 24 hr of treatment with NGF and were still significantly higher than control levels after 7 days. Epidermal growth factor transiently induced both mRNAs but at much lower levels. The mRNAs code for 95- (42C) and 101- (42A) amino acid residue peptides whose sequences are homologous to those of a family of calcium-binding proteins including the S-100 protein. The conservation of primary and secondary structure between 42A, 42C, and the other proteins suggests a possible role for them in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

4035354|a|Alterations in proto-oncogene expression after stimulation of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) have been investigated. A specific stimulation of c-fos messenger RNA and protein was detected 30 minutes after treatment. This induction was enhanced more than 100-fold in the presence of peripherally active benzodiazepines. The effect was specific as very little change was observed in the levels of c-rasHa, c-rasKi, c-myc, and N-myc messenger RNA's. Under the conditions used here, NGF treatment ultimately results in neurite outgrowth, with a reduction or cessation of cell division. Thus, stimulation of the c-fos gene in this system appeared to be associated with differentiation and not with cellular proliferation. The effect of benzodiazepines was stereospecific and represents a novel action of these compounds at the level of gene expression.

3672127|a|Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a trophic agent that promotes the outgrowth of nerve fibers from sympathetic and sensory ganglia. The neuronal differentiation stimulated by this hormone was examined in the NGF-responsive cell line PC12. Differential hybridization was used to screen a complementary DNA library constructed from PC12 cells treated with NGF and cycloheximide. One of the complementary DNA clones that was rapidly induced by NGF was found to have a nucleotide sequence that predicts a 54-kilodalton protein with homology to transcriptional regulatory proteins. This clone, NGFI-A, contains three tandemly repeated copies of the 28- to 30-amino acid "zinc finger" domain present in Xenopus laevis TFIIIA and other DNA-binding proteins. It also contains another highly conserved unit of eight amino acids that is repeated at least 11 times. The NGFI-A gene is expressed at relatively high levels in the brain, lung, and superior cervical ganglion of the adult rat.

3272167|a|Nerve growth factor (NGF) is required for the development and survival of sympathetic and neural crest-derived sensory neurons. The mechanism of action of NGF has been extensively studied in the NGF-responsive rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12. When treated with NGF, PC12 cells initiate neurite outgrowth and differentiate into cells with a neuronal phenotype. This process is prevented by RNA synthesis inhibitors. NGFI-B is a gene, identified by differential hybridization, that is rapidly, but transiently induced in PC12 cells by NGF. The nucleotide sequence of the NGFI-B gene was determined, and it encodes a 61 kd protein with strong homologies to members of the glucocorticoid receptor gene family. The two regions of homology between NGFI-B and this family of ligand-dependent transcriptional activators are the region corresponding to the DNA-binding domain and the region comprising the ligand-binding domain near the COOH-terminus. NGFI-B, as a possible ligand-dependent transcriptional activator induced by NGF, may play a role in initiating NGF-induced differentiation.

3130660|a|The Fos protein complex and several Fos-related antigens (FRA) bind specifically to a sequence element referred to as the HeLa cell activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding site. A combination of structural and immunological comparisons has identified the Fos-associated protein (p39) as the protein product of the jun proto-oncogene (c-Jun). The p39/Jun protein is one of the major polypeptides identified in AP-1 oligonucleotide affinity chromatography extracts of cellular proteins. These preparations of AP-1 also contain Fos and several FRA's. Some of these proteins bind to the AP-1 site directly whereas others, like Fos, appear to bind indirectly via protein-protein interactions. Cell-surface stimulation results in an increase in c-fos and c-jun products. Thus, the products of two protooncogenes (and several related proteins), induced by extracellular stimuli, form a complex that associates with transcriptional control elements containing AP-1 sites, thereby potentially mediating the long-term responses to signals that regulate growth control and development.

1105573|a|A method has been developed whereby a very large number of colonies of Escherichia coli carrying different hybrid plasmids can be rapidly screened to determine which hybrid plasmids contain a specified DNA sequence or genes. The colonies to be screened are formed on nitrocellulose filters, and, after a reference set of these colonies has been prepared by replica plating, are lysed and their DNA is denatured and fixed to the filter in situ. The resulting DNA-prints of the colonies are then hybridized to a radioactive RNA that defines the sequence or gene of interest, and the result of this hybridization is assayed by autoradiography. Colonies whose DNA-prints exhibit hybridization can then be picked from the reference plate. We have used this method to isolate clones of ColE1 hybrid plasmids that contain Drosophila melanogaster genes for 18 and 28S rRNAs. In principle, the method can be used to isolate any gene whose base sequence is represented in an available RNA.

6310370|a|We have constructed a genomic DNA library from a methotrexate-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHOC 400) in the cosmid vector pHC79. By utilizing a murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cDNA clone, we have identified 66 DHFR+ clones among the 11,000 colonies screened by colony hybridization. To isolate a recombinant cosmid containing the entire DHFR gene, we have tested these colonies for their ability to rescue a DHFR- Chinese hamster ovary cell line, using the spheroplast fusion method of gene transfer developed by W. Schaffner (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77:2163-2167, 1980). One clone (cH1) was able to transform DHFR- cells to the DHFR+ phenotype and was shown in hybridization studies to contain all of the gene except a small portion of the 3' untranslated region. We have mapped cosmid cH1 and several overlapping cosmids with a variety of restriction enzymes and have determined the approximate positions of the five (and possibly six) exons within the DHFR gene. Differences between the sizes of homologous genes in hamster cells (24.5 kilobases [kb]) and in mouse cells (31.5 kb) are shown to reside primarily in the length of the 3' intron, which is 8 kb in the hamster gene and 16 kb in length in the mouse gene. Our studies confirm the utility of cosmid libraries for the isolation of large genes, as previously shown by R. de Saint Vincent et al. (Cell 27:267-277, 1981). In addition, a cosmid that contains a functional DHFR gene will be a useful vector for the co-amplification and subsequent overexpression of other cloned genes.

6416827|a|Homeotic genes are involved in the control of developmental pathways: dominant mutations at the Antennapedia locus of Drosophila, for example, lead to replacement of the antennae on the head of the fly by mesothoracic legs. Using a combination of chromosome walking and jumping, we have cloned a DNA region from Drosophila containing Antennapedia. Five DNA inversion rearrangements which are associated with the Antennapedia mutant phenotype were localized within a 25-kb region. Genomic DNA sequences from this area were used as hybridization probes to screen cDNA libraries prepared from Drosophila embryonic and pupal poly(A)+ RNA. A 2.2-kb cDNA sequence (903) was isolated which appears to derive from at least four non-contiguous chromosomal regions that span 100 kb. It includes the positions of the inversion breakpoints. A second cDNA of 2.9 kb (909) is composed of sequences from at least three chromosomal regions, two of which are similar or identical to sequences contained in the 903 clone but the third is derived from genomic DNA within a putative 903 intron. The unusual size and complexity of this locus are discussed.

4059056|a|The unique properties of nylon membranes allow for dramatic improvement in the capillary transfer of DNA restriction fragments from agarose gels (Southern blotting). By using 0.4 M NaOH as the transfer solvent following a short pre-treatment of the gel in acid, DNA is depurinated during transfer. Fragments of all sizes are eluted and retained quantitatively by the membrane; furthermore, the alkaline solvent induces covalent fixation of DNA to the membrane. The saving in time and materials afforded by this simple modification is accompanied by a marked improvement in resolution and a ten-fold increase in sensitivity of subsequent hybridization analyses. In addition, we have found that nylon membrane completely retains native (and denatured) DNA in transfer solvents of low ionic strength (including distilled water), although quantitative elution of DNA from the gel is limited to fragments smaller than 4 Kb. This property can be utilized in the direct electrophoretic transfer of native restriction fragments from polyacrylamide gels. Exposure of DNA to ultraviolet light, either in the gel or following transfer to nylon membrane, reduces its ability to hybridize.

3014510|a|The nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated increase in c-fos gene expression in the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line has been investigated. NGF treatment of PC12 cells results in an increased level of c-fos mRNA within 15 min. An approximately 100-fold increase in the level of c-fos mRNA occurs 30-45 min after exposure to NGF and the c-fos mRNA concentration returns to its basal level 2 hr after NGF treatment. Thus, the half-life of this RNA transcript is extremely short. In the presence of cycloheximide, the c-fos gene is superinduced and the increased level of c-fos mRNA persists for at least 24 hr. The induction of c-fos gene expression was further studied by utilizing a monoclonal antibody (mAb-192) that is directed against the NGF receptor but does not compete with NGF for binding to the receptor. Treatment of the cells with mAb-192 inhibits the NGF-stimulated elevation of c-fos mRNA, suggesting that the antibody may interfere with the receptor's ability to generate the signal required to stimulate the transcription of this gene. NGF is not the only agent capable of inducing c-fos gene expression in these cells; epidermal growth factor, the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and the calcium ionophore A23187, agents that induce the c-fos gene in other cell lines, are also effective in PC12 cells. The mRNA for the nuclear protein fos is rapidly induced by NGF and other agents to which PC12 cells respond. This supports the hypothesis that the fos gene product may play a role in signal transduction.

6438633|a|We have developed a general method for introducing cloned genes into mammalian cells that affords substantial benefits over current technology. It is simple, rapid, and applicable to many (perhaps all) cell types, including those that are refractory to traditional transfection procedures. The method involves exposure of a suspension of cells and cloned DNA to a high-voltage electric discharge. In a model application of this transfection procedure, we have studied the expression of cloned human and mouse Ig kappa genes stably introduced into mouse pre-B cells and fibroblasts. We find that there is a B-cell-specific enhancer-activator region in the J-C intron of the human kappa gene that is necessary for efficient transcription of the cloned gene in mouse pre-B lymphocytes. This suggests that both the DNA element and the proteins required for its regulatory activity have been highly conserved in evolution and that these elements operate at the pre-B-cell stage of immunocyte development, a stage that precedes productive kappa gene rearrangement.

6960240|a|We constructed a series of recombinant genomes which directed expression of the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in mammalian cells. The prototype recombinant in this series, pSV2-cat, consisted of the beta-lactamase gene and origin of replication from pBR322 coupled to a simian virus 40 (SV40) early transcription region into which CAT coding sequences were inserted. Readily measured levels of CAT accumulated within 48 h after the introduction of pSV2-cat DNA into African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells. Because endogenous CAT activity is not present in CV-1 or other mammalian cells, and because rapid, sensitive assays for CAT activity are available, these recombinants provided a uniquely convenient system for monitoring the expression of foreign DNAs in tissue culture cells. To demonstrate the usefulness of this system, we constructed derivatives of pSV2-cat from which part or all of the SV40 promoter region was removed. Deletion of one copy of the 72-base-pair repeat sequence in the SV40 promoter caused no significant decrease in CAT synthesis in monkey kidney CV-1 cells; however, an additional deletion of 50 base pairs from the second copy of the repeats reduced CAT synthesis to 11% of its level in the wild type. We also constructed a recombinant, pSV0-cat, in which the entire SV40 promoter region was removed and a unique HindIII site was substituted for the insertion of other promoter sequences.

Proteolytic digestion of the protein in the particle yields periodic intermediates spaced at 3-K intervals and a limit digest containing 3-K fragments. The native particle is shown to contain 7-11 zinc atoms. These data suggest that the protein contains repetitive zinc-binding domains. Analysis of the amino acid sequence reveals nine tandem similar units, each consisting of approximately 30 residues and containing two invariant pairs of cysteines and histidines, the most common ligands for zinc. The linear arrangement of these repeated, independently folding domains, each centred on a zinc ion, comprises the major part of the protein. Such a structure explains how this small protein can bind to the long internal control region of the 5S RNA gene, and stay bound during the passage of an RNA polymerase molecule.

We have isolated six individual phages from a mouse genomic library on the basis of their DNA homology to Krüppel finger-coding probes, and describe here the DNA sequence and expression of two such clones containing finger-like structures. Upon differentiation of mouse teratocarcinoma cell line F9 with retinoic acid and cAMP, the expression of both genes was drastically reduced, and in one instance was undetectable.

We have isolated 23 bacteriophages, containing nonoverlapping inserts from a mouse genomic DNA library, on the basis of cross-hybridization under nonstringent conditions to a probe corresponding to the Krüppel finger region. Nucleotide sequence analysis of six phage DNAs indicated that they all contained regions with similarity to Krüppel and potentially encoded zinc finger domains. Within these regions, the level of similarity to Krüppel was particularly high between successive fingers. Northern (RNA) blotting analysis suggested that the mouse sequences belonged to different genes, the expression of some of which was modulated during cell differentiation and development. Hybridization experiments suggested that the similarity between some of the genes extended outside of the finger regions. In conclusion, our data suggest that the mouse genome contains a large family of evolutionarily related genes encoding possible trans-acting factors. These genes are likely to play a regulatory role at the transcriptional level.

Five additional mRNAs of this class are described in this report. The mRNAs reached peak levels between 40 and 120 min after serum addition and rapidly decayed thereafter. All 10 RNAs were superinduced in the presence of cycloheximide. Nuclear run-on experiments indicated that the increase in the mRNAs is the result of rapid transcriptional activation of their genes on stimulation by serum or platelet-derived growth factor. Superinducibility by cycloheximide is due to two effects: prolonged transcription and stabilization of mRNAs. This overall pattern of regulation is similar to that of the c-fos or c-myc protooncogenes reported previously. We hypothesize that these newly identified "immediate early" genes play a role in the proliferative response induced by growth factors.

We find that deletion of the TATA sequence does not reduce the transcriptional effectiveness of the promoter; however, the 5' ends of the transcripts are heterogeneous rather than being restricted to the usual sites. The short GC-rich repeat sequences between nucleotides 37 and 107 and the tandemly repeated 72-bp segment between nucleotides 107 and 250 are each essential for promoter function. The GC-rich repeats are functionally redundant and probably interchangeable, since several subsets of two or three of the GC-rich segments are sufficient. One copy of the 72-bp sequence is sufficient to permit transcription. Moreover, the 72-bp repeat sequences function normally even if they are inverted relative to their normal orientation.

We analyzed SV40 early-promoter deletion mutants and determined that transcriptional activation by Sp 1 requires sequences within tandem 21 bp repeats located 70-110 bp upstream of the transcription initiation sites. In a DNAase footprinting assay, Sp 1 protected sequences in this same 21 bp repeat region, thus indicating the presence of a specific site for Sp 1 binding. During purification of Sp 1, there was a correlation between transcription-stimulatory activity and promoter-binding activity. These results suggest that direct binding of Sp 1 to sequences in the upstream promoter element is the mechanism by which this factor activates transcription by RNA polymerase II at the SV40 early promoter.

2885756|a|Many hormones act on neuroendocrine cells by activating second messenger pathways. Two of these, the phosphoinositol and cAMP-dependent pathways, cause changes in cellular activity through specific protein kinases. By phosphorylating cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, these kinases apparently coordinate cellular processes, including the biosynthesis and release of neuropeptides. Somatostatin biosynthesis and release, for example, are both positively regulated by the second messenger cAMP in hypothalamic cells, and cAMP also induces somatostatin gene transcription 8-10-fold in transfected PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Transcriptional induction requires a 30-nucleotide cAMP response element (CRE) which is conserved in other cAMP-responsive genes. This element also confers cAMP responsiveness when placed upstream of the heterologous simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter. The somatostatin gene does not, however, respond to cAMP in mutant PC12 cells which lack cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II activity. Activation of somatostatin gene transcription may consequently require the phosphorylation of a nuclear protein which binds to the CRE. Using a DNase I protection assay, we have characterized a nuclear protein in PC12 cells which binds selectively to the CRE in the somatostatin gene. We have purified this protein which is of relative molecular mass 43,000 (Mr 43K) by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography. This 43K CRE binding protein (CREB) is phosphorylated in vitro when it is incubated with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Stimulating PC12 cells with forskolin, an activator of adenyl cyclase, causes a 3-4-fold increase in the phosphorylation of this protein. We conclude that the cAMP-dependent pathway may regulate gene transcription in response to hormonal stimulation by phosphorylating this CREB protein.

3754326|a|The eucaryotic transcription factor TFIIIA is required for 5S RNA transcription in Xenopus, and changes in the level of TFIIIA have been implicated in the differential expression of 5S RNA genes. In this paper, we report the isolation and sequencing of the X. laevis TFIIIA gene. The gene is approximately 11 kb in length and consists of 9 coding segments separated by 8 introns. A sequence of 30 amino acid residues is known to repeat imperfectly 9 times in tandem within the TFIIIA protein, and Miller et al. (EMBO J. 4, 1609-1614, 1985) proposed that TFIIIA evolved by duplication of a primordial 30 amino acid residue unit. Our results from DNA sequence analysis support their proposal by showing that some of the exon-intron boundaries correspond closely to the repeating unit. We also found that the 5' flanking sequence of the TFIIIA gene contains a TATA box (TATATAA) at position -32 and a CAAT box (GCCAATCC) at position -96 and that the site of polyadenylation is 255 residues 3' of the stop codon. Finally, we have shown that the coding sequence of the TFIIIA gene is significantly polymorphic.

3319186|a|Transcription factor Sp1 is a protein present in mammalian cells that binds to GC box promoter elements and selectively activates mRNA synthesis from genes that contain functional recognition sites. We have isolated a cDNA that encodes the 696 C-terminal amino acid residues of human Sp1. By expression of truncated fragments of Sp1 in E. coli, we have localized the DNA binding activity to the C-terminal 168 amino acid residues. In this region, Sp1 has three contiguous Zn(II) finger motifs, which are believed to be metalloprotein structures that interact with DNA. We have found that purified Sp1 requires Zn(II) for sequence-specific binding to DNA. Thus, it is likely that Sp1 interacts with DNA by binding of the Zn(II) fingers. To facilitate the identification of mutant variants of Sp1 that are defective in DNA binding, we have also devised a bacterial colony assay for detection of Sp1 binding to DNA.

3129290|a|Zinc fingers are DNA-binding domains present in several eukaryotic regulatory proteins. We have identified a mouse gene, Krox-20, encoding a protein with three zinc fingers and whose expression is activated during G0/G1 transition in cultured cells. Serum stimulation of quiescent cells leads to rapid and transient accumulation of Krox-20 mRNA, with kinetics similar to those of the c-fos proto-oncogene. The induction does not require de-novo protein synthesis. In the mouse, Krox-20 is expressed at low levels in tissues which contain rapidly dividing cells. These properties suggest that Krox-20 encodes a transcription control factor, possibly involved in the modulation of cell proliferation.

3690661|a|The presence or absence of the Y chromosome determines whether a mammalian embryo develops as a male or female. In humans, genetic deletion analysis of "sex-reversed" individuals has identified a small portion of the Y chromosome necessary and sufficient to induce testicular differentiation of the bipotential gonad. We report the cloning of a 230-kilobase segment of the human Y chromosome that contains some or all of the testis-determining factor gene (TDF), the master sex-determining locus. The cloned region spans the deletion in a female who carries all but 160 kilobases of the Y. Certain DNA sequences within this region were highly conserved during evolution; homologs occur on the Y chromosomes of all mammals examined. In particular, homologous sequences are found within the sex-determining region of the mouse Y chromosome. The nucleotide sequence of this conserved DNA on the human Y chromosome suggests that it encodes a protein with multiple "finger" domains, as first described in frog transcription factor IIIA. The encoded protein probably binds to nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner, and may regulate transcription. Very similar DNA sequences occur on the X chromosome of humans and other mammals. We discuss the possibility that the Y-encoded finger protein is the testis-determining factor, and propose models of sex determination accommodating the finding of a related locus on the X chromosome. The presence of similar sequences in birds suggests a possible role not only in the XX/XY sex determination system of mammals, but also in the ZZ/ZW system of birds.

3127059|a|Egr-1 is an early growth response gene that displays fos-like induction kinetics in fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and lymphocytes following mitogenic stimulation. Sequence analysis of murine Egr-1 cDNA predicts a protein with three DNA binding zinc fingers. The human EGR1 gene maps to chromosome 5 (bands 5q23-31). Egr-1 mRNA increases dramatically during cardiac and neural cell differentiation, and following membrane depolarization both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Egr-1 and c-fos are often coregulated with strikingly similar kinetics. These results, in conjunction with the Egr-1 primary structure, suggest that Egr-1 may function as a transcriptional regulator in diverse biological processes.

3477800|a|Positively acting, rate-limiting regulatory factors that influence tissue-specific expression of the human cardiac alpha-actin gene in a mouse muscle cell line are shown by in vivo competition and gel mobility-shift assays to bind to upstream regions of its promoter but to neither vector DNA nor a beta-globin promoter. Although the two binding regions are distinctly separated, each corresponds to a cis region required for muscle-specific transcriptional stimulation, and each contains a core CC(A + T-rich)6GG sequence (designated CArG box), which is found in the promoter regions of several muscle-associated genes. Each site has an apparently different binding affinity for trans-acting factors, which may explain the different transcriptional stimulation activities of the two cis regions. Therefore, we conclude that the two CArG box regions are responsible for muscle-specific transcriptional activity of the cardiac alpha-actin gene through a mechanism that involves their binding of a positive trans-acting factor in muscle cells.

We have used simian virus 40 (SV40)-pBR322 hybrid plasmids constructed in vitro as substrates to detect and quantitate intramolecular homologous and nonhomologous recombination events in cultured monkey cells. Excision of wild-type or defective SV40 DNAs by recombination from these plasmids was scored by the viral plaque assay, in either the absence or the presence of DNA from a temperature-sensitive helper virus. Several independent products of homologous and nonhomologous recombination have been isolated and characterized at the DNA sequence level. We find that neither DNA replication of the recombination substrate nor SV40 large T antigen is essential for either homologous or nonhomologous recombination involving viral or pBR322 sequences.

3856266|a|In this paper, we show that DNA added to mouse L cells by the calcium phosphate method can be inserted into the genome of those cells by homologous recombination. The insertion event is detected because it reconstructs a functional thymidine kinase (tk) gene from two defective genes that share 320 base pairs of homology. One of the genes is missing its 5' portion (tk delta 5') and is in the cell's chromosome, and the other is missing its 3' portion (tk delta 3') and is in the introduced DNA. Gene reconstruction by homologous insertion is relatively inefficient; approximately one Tk+ transformant is produced per 10(6) cells per 4 micrograms of added tk DNA, a frequency of about 10(-5) that of normal tk gene transformation. The Tk+ transformants produced by homologous recombination contain Sma I and Pvu II fragments that are diagnostic of the intact tk gene, contain a herpesvirus-specific thymidine kinase activity, and can transfer the Tk+ phenotype to Tk- cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer. Two surprising observations made in the course of these studies were that only 1 of 10 Tk- cell lines containing defective tk genes could be transformed to Tk+ by homologous insertion of the complementary defective tk gene and that relatively little illegitimate insertion of introduced tk DNA into cellular DNA was detected in those cells that were transformed to Tk+ by homologous recombination.

A specialized construct of the neomycin resistance (neor) gene was introduced into an exon of a cloned fragment of the Hprt gene and used to transfect ES cells. Among the G418r colonies, 1/1000 were also resistant to the base analog 6-thioguanine (6-TG). The G418r, 6-TGr cells were all shown to be Hprt- as the result of homologous recombination with the exogenous, neor-containing, Hprt sequences. We have compared the gene-targeting efficiencies of two classes of neor-Hprt recombinant vectors: those that replace the endogenous sequence with the exogenous sequence and those that insert the exogenous sequence into the endogenous sequence. The targeting efficiencies of both classes of vectors are strongly dependent upon the extent of homology between exogenous and endogenous sequences. The protocol described herein should be useful for targeting mutations into any gene.

We determined how the number, the arrangement, and the chromosomal position of the integrated gene, as well as the number of injected molecules influence the gene-targeting frequency. Recombination between the newly introduced DNA and its chromosomal homolog occurred at a frequency of 1 in 10(3) cells receiving DNA. Correction events were mediated by either double reciprocal recombination or gene conversion. This resulted in sequences in the genome being replaced by sequences of the introduced DNA or, in separate experiments, sequences in the incoming DNA being replaced by chromosomal sequences. Both point mutations and deletion mutations were corrected; however, the nature of the mutation carried by the respective sequence influenced whether the integrated or injected sequence was corrected.

Recombinants resulting in an intact neo gene were selected by their G418 resistance phenotype. The best ratio of homologous to nonhomologous recombination events was about 1:80.

These are, first, the characterization of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that can still enter the germline after genetic manipulation in culture and second, the demonstration that homologous recombination between a native target chromosomal gene and exogenous DAN can be used in culture to modify specifically the target locus. We here use gene targetting functionally to correct the mutant hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene in the ES cell line which has previously been isolated and used to produce an HPRT-deficient mouse. This modification of a chosen gene in pluripotent ES cells demonstrates the feasibility of this route to manipulating mammalian genomes in predetermined ways.

6330525|a|We have constructed phage lambda and plasmid DNA substrates (lambda tk2 and ptk2) that contain two defective herpesvirus thymidine kinase (tk) genes that can be used to detect homologous recombination during the transfer of DNA into mouse L cells deficient in thymidine kinase activity. The recombination event reconstructs a wild-type tk gene and is scored because it converts Tk- cells to Tk+. Using this system, we have shown that (i) both intramolecular and intermolecular homologous recombination can be detected after gene transfer; (ii) the degree of recombination decreases with decreasing tk gene homology; and (iii) the efficiency of recombination can be stimulated 10- to 100-fold by cutting the tk2 DNA with restriction enzymes at appropriate sites relative to the recombining sequences. Based on the substrate requirements for these recombination events, we propose a model to explain how recombination might occur in mammalian cells. The essential features of the model are that the cut restriction site ends are substrates for cellular exonucleases that degrade DNA strands. This process exposes complementary strands of the two defective tk genes, which then pair. Removal of unpaired DNA at the junction between the paired and unpaired regions permits a gap repair process to reconstruct an intact gene.

6328502|a|We have used the eukaryotic-prokaryotic shuttle vector pSV2Neo to demonstrate that cultured mammalian somatic cells have the enzymatic machinery to mediate homologous recombination and that the frequency of this recombination can be enhanced by pretreatment of the input DNA. Two nonoverlapping deletion mutants of pSV2Neo were constructed, each affecting the bacterial aminoglycoside 3'-phosphorylase gene (the neo gene), which confers resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics on bacteria and resistance to the antibiotic G418 on mammalian cells. Mammalian cells transfected with either deletion plasmid alone yield no G418 -resistant colonies. Cells cotransfected with both deletion plasmids yield G418 -resistant colonies with high frequency. We show that these resistant colonies result from recombination involving homologous crossing-over or gene conversion between the deletion plasmids by rescuing from the resistant cells both types of reciprocal recombinant, full-length plasmids, and doubly deleted plasmids. Cutting one of the input plasmids to generate a double-stranded gap in the neo gene considerably enhances the frequency of homologous recombination within the gene. This suggests that targeting exogenous DNA to specific sites in mammalian chromosomes could be facilitated by suitable pretreatment of the DNA.

3018550|a|Cultured animal cells rearrange foreign DNA very efficiently by homologous recombination. The individual steps that constitute the mechanism(s) of homologous recombination in transfected DNA are as yet undefined. In this study, we examined the topological requirements by using the genome of simian virus 40 (SV40) as a probe. By assaying homologous recombination between defective SV40 genomes after transfection into CV1 monkey cells, we showed that linear molecules are preferred substrates for homologous exchanges, exchanges are distributed around the SV40 genome, and the frequency of exchange is not diminished significantly by the presence of short stretches of non-SV40 DNA at the ends. These observations are considered in relation to current models of homologous recombination in mammalian cells, and a new model is proposed. The function of somatic cell recombination is discussed.

3037530|a|In animal cells, exogenous DNA recombines into random chromosomal sites much more frequently than it recombines into homologous sites. Free DNA ends are "recombinogenic" in both processes. To test the effects of specific ends on analogous extrachromosomal processes, we constructed a linear genome of simian virus 40 with terminal repeated sequences. After transfection into monkey cells, the model substrate can circularize by end joining (analogous to random integration) or by homologous recombination between its terminal repeats (analogous to targeted recombination). Since the two types of recombination are in competition with one another, the ratio of homologous-recombination to end-join products is a sensitive indicator of the differential effects of specific ends. Substrates with blunt ends, complementary sticky ends, or mismatched ends generated the same ratio of homologous-recombination to end-join products. However, addition of dideoxynucleotides to the 3' hydroxyls of the substrate decreased the frequency of end joining by a factor of 5-6 relative to homologous recombination. Thus, the frequency of end joining can be decreased relative to that of homologous recombination by modification of the ends of the input DNA. These results suggest an approach to altering the ratio of random to targeted integration in mammalian cells.

Subsequently, these recombinants were used to generate cell lines that produced defective helper-free retroviruses carrying each of the viral oncogenes. These recombinant retroviruses were used to analyze the role of the viral genes in transformation of rat F111 cells. Expression of the polyomavirus middle T antigen alone resulted in cell lines that were highly tumorigenic, whereas expression of the polyomavirus large T resulted in cell lines that were highly tumorigenic, whereas expression of the polyomavirus large T resulted in cell lines that were unaltered by the criteria of morphology, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity. More surprisingly, SV40 large T-expressing cell lines were not tumorigenic despite the fact that they contained elevated levels of cellular p53 and had a high plating efficiency in soft agar. These results suggest that the SV40 large T antigen is not an acute transforming gene like the polyomavirus middle T antigen but is similar to the establishment genes such as myc and adenovirus EIa.

Although the parent wild-type proviral clone, pMOV-psi+, quickly causes a high level of reverse-transcriptase-containing virus particles to be released from transfected NIH/3T3 cells, transfection of pMOV-psi- into these cells initially results in very little release. By 9 to 10 days after transfection, however, pMOV-psi- -transfected cells produce infectious virus. Thus pMOV-psi- has a defect that can be repaired in transfected NIH/3T3 cells, presumably by recombination with a sequence normally present in the cells. Cell lines with pMOV-psi- stably integrated into chromosomal DNA produce reverse-transcriptase-containing particles that lack detectable M-MuLV RNA but the cells efficiently complement replication-defective, packagable retroviruses. Thus pMOV-psi- has a defect in the packaging of genomic RNA into virions but can provide in trans the products necessary for virion production. The deletion in pMOV-psi- appears to define a site required in cis for packaging of MuLV RNA into virions. Cell lines carrying pMOV-psi- can be used to produce helper-free stocks of natural or synthetic defective retroviruses.

Shifting the cells from the nonpermissive temperature to a lower permissive temperature caused the amplification of the suppressor tRNA gene, which resulted in suppression efficiencies at amber codons of 50%-70%, as measured by suppression of an amber codon in the E. coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. A mutant of poliovirus, in which a serine codon in the replicase gene was converted to an amber codon, was efficiently propagated on the suppressor-positive cell lines. The mutant virus reverted to wild-type by a single base change to a serine codon at a frequency of approximately 2.5 x 10(-6), surprisingly low for a RNA genome.

6098471|a|The gene for the neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II) from transposon Tn5 was fused at the amino or carboxy terminus to foreign DNA sequences coding for 3-300 amino acids and the properties of the fused proteins were investigated. All amino-terminal fusions examined conferred kanamycin resistance to their host cell, but profound differences in their enzymatic activity and stability were detected. Short additions to the amino terminus of the NPT II resulted in highly enzymatically active fusion proteins whereas long amino-terminal fusions often had to be proteolytically degraded to release active proteins. Fusions at the carboxy-terminal end of the NPT II protein did not always induce kanamycin resistance and their enzymatic activity depended more stringently on the nature of the junction sequence.

3288984|a|Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [acetyl-CoA:chloramphenicol O3-acetyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.28] is the enzyme responsible for high-level bacterial resistance to the antibiotic chloramphenicol. It catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl CoA to the primary hydroxyl of chloramphenicol. The x-ray crystallographic structure of the type III variant enzyme from Escherichia coli has been determined and refined at 1.75-A resolution. The enzyme is a trimer of identical subunits with a distinctive protein fold. Structure of the trimer is stabilized by a beta-pleated sheet that extends from one subunit to the next. The active site is located at the subunit interface, and the binding sites for both chloramphenicol and CoA have been characterized. Substrate binding is unusual in that the two substrates approach the active site via clefts on opposite molecular "sides." A histidine residue previously implicated in catalysis is appropriately positioned to act as a general base catalyst in the reaction.

6305508|a|Gamma rays have been used to induce Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants in which the entire locus for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has been eliminated. These mutants were isolated in two steps from a methotrexate-resistant clone (Flintoff, Davidson, and Siminovitch (1976). Somat. Cell Genet. 2, 245-262). The resistant cells contain amplified copies of a mutant dhfr gene that codes for a drug-resistant form of the enzyme. In the first step, methotrexate-sensitive mutants of the amplified line were selected. These mutants exhibit a reduced level of DHFR activity and contain a reduced number of dhfr genes. The remaining DHFR activity is methotrexate-sensitive. These mutants appear to be hemizygotes that have lost all copies of the amplified altered dhfr genes and retain one wild-type allele. In a second mutagenic step, mutants completely deficient in DHFR activity were isolated. Three of four of these mutants were the result of double deletions: they lack all traces of dhfr DNA sequences. The fourth mutant contains a deletion that extends through the 5' half of the dhfr gene. The hemizygotes for dhfr should be useful for the study of mutation at an autosomal mammalian locus without the complications of diploidy.

The activities of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) in three such mutants have been found to exhibit an increased Km for the substrate 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. The isoelectric point of the mutant enzyme activity has also changed in two mutants. Hybrid cells containing one mutant and one wild-type allele express both genes. Segregants that have lost only the wild-type allele can be selected on the basis of drug resistance. Two mutants exhibiting different alterations in HPRT activity can complement in a hybrid cell to yield a wild-type growth pattern and enzyme activity with intermediate electrophoretic and kinetic properties. The results suggest intracistronic complementation between structural gene mutants of HPRT.

3396860|a|Recombination in mammalian cells is thought to involve both reciprocal and nonreciprocal modes of exchange, although rigorous proof is lacking due to the inability to recover all products of an exchange. To investigate further the relationship between these modes of exchange, we have analyzed intrachromosomal recombination between duplicated herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV tk) mutant alleles arranged as inverted repeats in cultured mouse L cells. In crosses between inverted repeats, a single intrachromatid reciprocal exchange leads to inversion of the sequence between the crossover sites and recovery of both genes involved in the event. The majority of recombinant products do not display such inversion and are thus consistent with a nonreciprocal mode of recombination (gene conversion). The remaining products display the sequence inversion predicted for intrachromatid reciprocal exchange. In light of the fact that intrachromatid exchanges occur, the rarity of intrachromatid double reciprocal exchanges strengthens the interpretation that the majority of events in this and previous investigations involve gene conversion. Furthermore, in accord with prediction, one-third of the reciprocal recombinants (inversions) display associated gene conversion. This association suggests that reciprocal and nonreciprocal modes of exchange are mechanistically related in mammalian cells. Finally, the occurrence of inversion recombinants suggests that intrachromosomal recombination can be a conservative (nondestructive) process.

During the culture period these embryonic cells are accessible for experimental genetic manipulation. Here we report the use of retroviral vectors to introduce exogenous DNA sequences into a stem-cell line and show that these modified cells contribute extensively to the somatic and germ-cell lineages in chimaeric mice. Compared with current methods for manipulation of the mouse genome, this approach has the advantage that powerful somatic-cell genetic techniques can be used to modify and to select cells with germ-line potential, allowing the derivation of transgenic strains with pre-determined genetic changes. We have by this means inserted many proviral vector sequences that provide new chromosomal molecular markers for linkage studies in the mouse and that also may cause insertional mutations.

3174435|a|The modification of chromosomal genes by homologous recombination between exogenous DNA and a target locus provides a powerful approach to the study of gene function. One of the current limitations of this gene targetting is the difficulty of identifying cells containing the correctly modified target locus when the modified gene is not amenable to either direct or indirect selection. We here describe a procedure for identifying correctly modified cells that depends on amplifying by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) predictable fragments of DNA present only in the desired recombinants. This recombinant fragment assay can detect targetted modification using only a few cells, either alone or mixed with tens of thousands of unmodified cells; it does not depend on the phenotype of the modified gene, or on its expression in the target cells. The PCR amplification needed for the procedure is carried out with a heat stable polymerase and a simple automatic temperature-shift apparatus which is described.

182671|a|A comprehensive ultrastructural analysis of sporulation and parasporal crystal development is described for Bacillus thuringiensis. The insecticidal crystal of B. thuringiensis is initiated at the start of engulfment and is nearly complete by the time the exosporium forms. The crystal and a heretofore unobserved ovoid inclusion develop without any clear association with the forespore septum, exosporium, or mesosomes. These observations contradict previous hypotheses that the crystal is synthesized on the forespore membrane, exosporium, or mesosomes. Formation of forespore septa involves densely staining, double-membrane-bound, vesicular mesosomes that have a bridged appearance. Forespore engulfment is subpolar and also involves mesosomes. Upon completion of engulfment and the following cytoplasmic changes occur: decrease in electron density of the incipient forespore membrane; loss of bridged appearance of incipient forespore membrane; change in stainability of incipient forespore, forespore, and mother cell cytoplasms; and alteration in staining quality of plasma membrane. These changes are involved in the conversion of the incipient forespore into a forespore and reflect "commitment" to sporulation.

The recombinant protein (Bt8) was purified and shown to be a mosquito-specific toxin with a LC50 value of 43 ng/ml to third-instar larvae of Aedes aegypti. Bt8 is processed by proteases or midgut extracts of mosquito larvae into toxic fragments of 68-78 kDa. Deletion mapping indicated that the active fragment of Bt8 is localized in the N-terminal half of the protoxin molecule. The deduced amino acid sequence of Bt8 has been compared with that of Bt2, a Lepidoptera-specific toxin, previously cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis berliner. Highly homologous amino acid stretches are present in the C-terminal half of the proteins. The N-terminal parts show much less sequence homology but they display a strikingly similar distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. In addition, Bt8 and Bt2 show a significant immunological cross-reaction. The data indicate that although these B.t. delta endotoxins exhibit a different insect-host specificity, they are structurally related and might use a similar mechanism to interact with insect cell membranes.

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of this Bt2 protein with the B. thuringiensis kurstaki HD1 Dipel, B. thuringiensis kurstaki HD73 and B. thuringiensis sotto crystal protein sequences suggests that homologous recombination between the different genes has occurred during evolution. Treatment of the Bt2 protein with trypsin or chymotrypsin yields a 60-kDa protease-resistant and fully toxic polypeptide. The minimal portion of the Bt2 protein required for toxicity has been determined by analysing the polypeptides produced by deletion derivatives of the bt2 gene. It coincides with the 60-kDa protease-resistant Bt2 fragment and it starts between amino acids 29 and 35 at the N-terminus and terminates between positions 599 and 607 at the C-terminus.

The lectins soybean agglutinin and wheat germ agglutinin, which bind N-acetylgalactosamine, also inhibited toxicity. Since N-acetylneuraminic acid is not known to occur in insects, these results suggest that the toxin may recognise a specific plasma membrane glycoconjugate receptor with a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue.

We have analyzed the peptides produced by recombinant Escherichia coli strains bearing deletions and fusions of the protoxin gene in order to delineate the portion of the gene which encodes the toxic peptide. The recombinant strains produced the toxic peptide as well as larger peptides whose size was related to the length of the deleted gene. The results indicate that the amino-terminal 55% of the protoxin protein is sufficient for toxicity. While two different gene fusions to the 10th codon allowed the synthesis of toxic polypeptides, fusions to the 50th codon did not. 3' end deletions up to the 645th codon allowed synthesis of the toxic peptide whereas a deletion to the 603rd codon yielded a non-toxic peptide. Some of the 5' and 3' end alterations to the gene caused changes in the proteolytic cleavage patterns of the polypeptides synthesized by E. coli, suggesting that the alterations led to conformational changes in the proteins. The presence of different 3' end segments affected the levels of synthesis of the altered crystal proteins.

By using a synthetic 27-base oligonucleotide corresponding to a stretch of nine N-terminal amino acids of a tryptic fragment of purified crystal protein of var. tenebrionis as a probe, recombinant colonies were screened by in situ hybridization for the presence of the crystal protein gene. Positive clones obtained from this screening were further tested for toxicity. One recombinant, NSBP544 (which contained a 5.9-kilobase BamHI insert), was toxic to larvae of Colorado potato beetle. Immunoblot analysis revealed that this clone produces two crystal-specific antigens of 65 and 73 kDa as do sporulating var. tenebrionis cells. However, purified crystal inclusions from var. tenebrionis contain a primary peptide component of 65 kDa. A 1932-base-pair open reading frame with a coding capacity of 73,119 Da has been identified by nucleotide sequencing analysis of the cloned crystal protein. In addition, mung bean nuclease mapping indicates that transcription of the crystal protein of var. tenebrionis initiates 130 base pairs upstream from the translational start site. Southern blot analysis using an internal 0.7-kilobase EcoRI fragment of pNSBP544 as a probe revealed that the crystal protein gene is located on a 90-MDa plasmid.

6407474|a|A protein of apparent mol.wt. 35000 that is extractable from the purified coat fraction of Bacillus megaterium KM spores is synthesized during sporulation as a precursor protein from which a 12-13 amino acid peptide is removed. Cleavage of this small peptide is delayed until 60-90 min after precursor synthesis and is concomitant with the morphological appearance of stage VI. The addition of chloramphenicol, subsequent to precursor synthesis, prevents the appearance of this late processing event. Two-dimensional non-equilibrium pH-gradient gel electrophoresis of the integument extract of forespores isolated at stage V from sporangia pulse-labelled with L-[35S]methionine 1 h before isolation, revealed both unprocessed and processed components. Similar analysis of total protein from the corresponding mother cells revealed only the unprocessed component in relatively small amounts, suggesting that, although the protein may be synthesized in the mother-cell compartment, processing may be restricted to the forespore. Peptide analysis by limited proteolysis was used to examine the relationship between the 35000- and a 17500-mol.wt. coat protein. The possible implications of limited proteolytic processing to maturation of the spore coat are discussed.

6798972|a|The rate of commitment of bacterial spores to germinate after short exposure to L-alanine increases exponentially from the time of addition of L-alanine. This absence of a lag facilitates kinetic analysis and allows the dependence of commitment on temperature and pH to be determined. The pH profile of commitment has been compared with that obtained from measurements of absorbance decreases during germination, and the two profiles exhibit differing pK values. It is suggested that because the decrease in A600 of spore suspensions is a late event in germination, it is an unsuitable parameter for studying germination-triggering reactions. Commitment has been shown to be temperature-dependent, with an optimum at approx. 37 degrees C and an activation energy (mu) of 1.08 X 10(5) J/mol. The data obtained from the present studies have been used to develop a model for the triggering of germination.

6874728|a|Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis parasporal crystal delta-endotoxin was purified by ultracentrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Native delta-endotoxin crystals showed no detectable toxicity in the vitro and in vivo systems that are described. By contrast alkali-solubilized crystal delta-endotoxin caused rapid cytological and cytopathological changes in Aedes albopictus, Choristoneura fumiferana 63 CF1, Spodoptera frugiperda and Trichoplusia ni cell lines as observed by phase-contrast microscopy and vital staining. Mouse fibroblasts, primary pig lymphocytes and three mouse epithelial carcinoma cell types showed a similar response to the alkali-soluble crystal delta-endotoxin. In addition the soluble crystal delta-endotoxin protein caused haemolysis of rat, mouse, sheep, horse and human erythrocytes. Intravenous administration of the alkali-soluble crystal delta-endotoxin to Balb. c mice at a dose rate of 15-30 micrograms of protein per gram body weight resulted in rapid paralysis followed by death within 12h. Subcutaneous inoculation of 15-30 micrograms of protein per gram body weight resulted in death of suckling mice in 2-3 h. The alkali-solubilized crystal delta-endotoxin was not toxic however, when administered per os. A comparison is made with a similar alkali-soluble fraction from the parasporal crystal delta-endotoxin of B. thuringiensis var kurstaki. With the exception of the Lepidopteran cell line, Choristoneura fumiferana 63 CF1, this soluble crystal delta-endotoxin protein showed no in vitro or in vivo toxicity, and no haemolytic activity.

388439|a|A method has been devised for the electrophoretic transfer of proteins from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose sheets. The method results in quantitative transfer of ribosomal proteins from gels containing urea. For sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, the original band pattern was obtained with no loss of resolution, but the transfer was not quantitative. The method allows detection of proteins by autoradiography and is simpler than conventional procedures. The immobilized proteins were detectable by immunological procedures. All additional binding capacity on the nitrocellulose was blocked with excess protein; then a specific antibody was bound and, finally, a second antibody directed against the first antibody. The second antibody was either radioactively labeled or conjugated to fluorescein or to peroxidase. The specific protein was then detected by either autoradiography, under UV light, or by the peroxidase reaction product, respectively. In the latter case, as little as 100 pg of protein was clearly detectable. It is anticipated that the procedure will be applicable to analysis of a wide variety of proteins with specific reactions or ligands.

3025452|a|The nucleotide sequence of a 1408 base-pair DNA fragment encoding the insecticidal 27,340 Mr delta-endotoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis has been determined by analysis of a recombinant plasmid from Escherichia coli. The hydropathy plot of the protein shows it to be highly hydrophobic, consistent with a postulated cytolytic mechanism of action for the toxin. In addition, the delta-endotoxin transcriptional start points that are used in B. thuringiensis and an E. coli recombinant have been determined. In B. thuringiensis var. israelensis, transcription initiates from a single start point, and gene-specific transcripts are not observed before stage II of sporulation. This is the stage at which delta-endotoxin antigen is first detected, indicating that control of expression is primarily at the transcriptional level for this protein. Analysis of gene-specific transcription in E. coli indicates that at least three start points are utilized in this organism. Interestingly, the highest level of delta-endotoxin mRNA is seen during mid-exponential growth of E. coli and the level appears to decrease as the cells enter the stationary phase of growth.

6090216|a|Recombinant plasmids containing the mosquitocidal delta-endotoxin gene were constructed by inserting HindIII fragments of the Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis 72-75 Md plasmid in to the Escherichia coli vector pUC12. Two recombinants producing the 26 000 Da delta-endotoxin (pIP173 and pIP174) were identified by screening clones in an E. coli in vitro transcription-translation system. Both recombinants were 12.4 kb chimaeric plasmids comprising pUC12 and a common 9.7 kb HindIII fragment of the B. thuringiensis plasmid. The 26 000 Da polypeptide synthesis in vivo from pIP174 transformed into E. coli JM101 was lethal to mosquito larvae and cytotoxic to mosquito cells in vitro. The biological authenticity of the cloned product was further confirmed by demonstrating that the cytotoxicity of the polypeptide was neutralised by antiserum to the authentic delta-endotoxin or by preincubation with excess toxin receptor. Transcription of the recombinant delta-endotoxin gene in E. coli appears to utilise a Bacillus promoter sequence(s) rather than the pUC12 beta-galactosidase promotor.

1100382|a|The binding of Mg2+ to tRNAPhe (yeast) in three conformational states was studied at 10, 30, 45, and 70 degrees C by the fluorescence indicator 8-hydroxyquinoline 5-sulphonic acid in the presence of 0.032 M monovalent cations (Na+). At temperatures below those characteristic for early melting (completely folded tRNA) the Scatchard plots are biphasic. They were well fitted by two classes of noninteracting binding sites with stability constants independent of temperature (KA = 9X10(4), KB = 6X10(3) M-1). In partially unfolded tRNA the strong binding process is co-operative. A single class of weak sites was found in the statistically coiled conformation at 70 degrees C (KB = 3.3X103 M-1). The total number of binding sites is 23 +/- 5; differences for the folded and unfolded conformations are smaller than 1. The influence of Mg2+ on the stability of the conformational elements of tRNAPhe (yeast) and its CCA-half (i.e. nucleotides 38--76) was determined by differential ultraviolet absorbance and depolarisation melting curves using the fluorescence of the Y base. Tertiary structure corresponding to early melting is stabilized by strongly bound Mg2+, whereas all other melting transitions are only influenced by Mg2+ bound at weak sites. The stability constants of tertiary structure obtained from the melting experiments can quantitatively be described by assuming that 5 +/- 1 non-interacting strong sites as characterized by the fluorescence titrations are converted to weak sites upon unfolding of the tertiary structure. Co-operative interaction of Mg2+ with the 5 strong sites in the folded conformation of tRNA can be ruled out. Strong binding of Mg2+ to completely folded tRNA does not produce a conformational transition changing ultraviolet absorbance, circular dichroism and sedimentation coefficient.

These observations taken in conjunction with the low-field spectrum of yeast tRNAPhe show that the unique ethidium bromide binding site is located between base pairs AU6 and AU7 of the amino acid acceptor stem. This information should be of value in understanding the way in which ethidium bromide binding alters the biochemical properties of the tRNA molecules.

This is completely consistent with results from earlier NMR studies which placed the single, strong ethidium binding site of yeast tRNAphe between base pairs 6 and 7 on the aminoacyl stem. From the known tertiary structure of tRNAphe it is possible to rationalize the unusual affinity of this site and its likely existence in all tRNAs.

1094451|a|The high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of hydrogen-bonded protons in four tRNAs have been studied at 270 MHz. The relative intensity of the resonances between -11 ppm and -15 ppm of Escherichia coli tRNA1-Va1 indicate that there are 26 plus or minus 3 protons, while only 20 are expected from secondary structure Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds inthe cloverleaf structure. Several possible candidates for these extra resonances are suggested by tertiary interactions observed in recent crystallographic studies. Of the four tRNAs studied, three, e.g., E. coli tRNA1Va1, E. coli tRNA-Arg and E. coli tRNA-Phe have one "GU pair" in their cloverleaf structure, while the fourth, yeast tRNA-Asp,has three "GU pairs" and one "G pair". Correlating these with the NMR spectra in the -10 ppm to -11 ppm region allows us to conclude that the "GU pairs" are not hydrogen-bonded by tautomerization to the lactim form. At the very low field region, near -14.9 ppm, the three E. coli tRNAs show a single resonance which is attributed to the 4-thiouracil 8 to adenine 14 hydrogen bond of the tertiary structure, by analogy with the recent crystal structure of yeast tRNA-Phe. This assignment is confirmed by the disappearance of this resonance after treatment with cyanogen bromide.

788776|a|Resonances in the low-field (11-15 ppm) nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (NMR) of tRNA molecules arise from secondary and tertiary structure base pairs (1 resonance for each base pair) as well as tertiary structure hydrogen bonds. An accurate method for integrating the low-field spectra has been developed and applied to seven different tRNA. In the presence of high levels of magnesium (10 mM free magnesium) the number of resonances (base pairs) per molecule is typically 3-4 more than the number predicted by the cloverleaf model. These results confirm our recent proposal that, under proper conditions, most tRNA exhibit 3-4 tertiary structure interactions in solution, which are also observed in x-ray diffraction studies of yeast tRNAPhe. In addition to common resonances in the 11-15 ppm region, there are common resonances at 10.5 and 9.5 ppm. A critique of methods used to integrate the low-field spectra is given and possible sources of error are indicated. The discrepancy between our present results and previous studies, which indicated that the number of base pairs per molecule was close to the number predicted by the cloverleaf model, can be attributed partly to differences in magnesium concentration and partly to inaccuracies inherent in the integration methods used.

775444|a|The atomic coordinates of yeast tRNA(Phe) in the monoclinic crystal form have been determined by an independent analysis from a model built into a 3 A MIR map. The overall molecular structure is found to be in agreement with those reported for the same crystal form by Ladner et al. (1975) and for the orthorhombic form by Quigley et al. (1975) and Kim et al. (1975). However, significant differences between any two of the four models are found in certain local regions of the molecule. The structure is analyzed in terms of the nucleotide stereochemistry and internucleotide phosphodiesters. A striking observation is that the majority of the nucleotide moieties occur in the conformation preferred by the constituent mononucleotides themselves. The internucleotide P-O bonds afford the primary source of flexibility for the folding of the polynucleotide backbone while the sugar pucker and C(4')-C(5') torsions provide the secondary source of flexibility.

The overall features of the molecule are virtually the same as those seen at a resolution of 4 angstroms except that many additional details of tertiary structure are now visualized. Ten types of hydrogen bonding are identified which define the specificity of tertiary interactions. The molecule is also stabilized by considerable stacking of the planar purines and pyrimidines. This tertiary structure explains, in a simple and direct fashion, chemical modification studies of transfer RNA. Since most of the tertiary interactions involve nucleotides which are common to all transfer RNA 's, it is likely that this three-dimensional structure provides a basic pattern of folding which may help to clarify the three-dimensional structure of all transfer RNA's.

192553|a|The native structure of tRNA is not achieved in low salt (4.5 mM Na+, 25 degrees C), but can be restored by addition of divalent ions. We have explored the structure of the central region in Escherichia coli tRNAfMet by absorption and emission spectroscopy of 4-thiouracil, and the structure of the anticodon loop in yeast tRNAPhe by fluorescence of the 'Y' base, versus the number of manganese ions bound to tRNA, which was derived from electron spin resonance. The fluorescence of the reduced 8-13 photoproduct (in which 4-thiouracil at position 8 is crosslinked to cytosine at position 13) was also analysed. In low salt (e.g. 4.5 mM Na+), the region of 4-thiouracil is affected strongly as the first eight Mn2+ bind to tRNA, whereas the fluorescence of the 'Y' base is affected only after four Mn2+ are bound. Considering the structural similarities of the two tRNAs, this suggests that the reorganisation brought about by divalent ions starts in the central region, the anticodon loop being affected later. The binding of divalent ions to each region starts together with its restructuration. Monovalent ions can substitute for divalent ions in this process, a 15 mM sodium concentration being equivalent to the binding of the first five Mn2+. If divalent ions are then added, even the first ones distribute themselves between both the central and the anticodon region. Alternatively, the renaturation may be achieved by monovalent ions only, implying that no sites exist whose occupancy by divalent ions is crucial for the native structure. These observations suggest that the role and means of divalent ion binding to tRNA are largely explainable in terms of a simple maganese-phosphate binding supplemented by electrostatic interaction with distant phosphates.

4111050|a|Fluorescence of quinacrine in the presence of different polynucleotides was studied to attempt to identify the specific nucleotides responsible for the fluorescence of stained chromosome preparations. A marked enhancement of fluorescence was seen in the presence of bihelical polynucleotides, such as poly(dA-dT), poly(dA).poly(dT), and poly(rA).poly(rU), but not in the presence of single-stranded polynucleotides, such as poly(dA), poly(dT), poly(rA), or poly(rU) alone. The higher was the GC content of natural DNAs, the more they quenched. Quenching was also seen with poly(dG) or poly(rG) alone, but not with poly(dC) or poly(rC) alone. Native and denatured DNA were both effective in quenching fluorescence. Thus, a bihelical conformation is not required for fluorescence quenching. Nearly all of these properties are shared with proflavine. In contrast, acridine orange, which stains most areas of chromosome preparations, shows enhanced fluorescence in the presence of all members of a series of natural DNAs. These data suggest that base-pairs composed of AT (rather than GC) residues are responsible for the observed fluorescence of specific chromosome regions after treatment with quinacrine, and support the proposal of Ellison and Barr (Chromosoma, in press) that the highly localized quinacrine fluorescence in their cytological preparations reflects the presence of DNA that has a high (A + T)/(G + C) ratio.

4050772|a|The prevalence of gallbladder disease (surgery or complaints) among Mexican Americans in Starr County, Texas, is demonstrated to be some threefold higher than in Framingham, with 13% and 26% of males and females, respectively, over the age of 35 years having the disease. The population aggregation of gallbladder disease in Amerindian groups and those genetically admixed with them (as the present case) is consistent with an underlying genetic mechanism which is further substantiated here by examining relative risks in sibs, offspring, and spouses of individuals with gallbladder disease. It is shown that in females under the age of 45 years, there is evidence for a significant association between gallbladder disease and diabetes beyond that which could be explained by body mass. Significant gallbladder disease by nonlinear age interaction effects was detected for serum cholesterol. The predicted regression lines of cholesterol by age were uniformly lower for individuals with gallbladder disease than those without it except for ages 40-55 years, in which the lines were equal. When coupled with previous results on diabetes, the results presented document the extent to which diabetes and gallbladder disease dominate the health status of Mexican Americans in southern Texas and likely elsewhere.

5428046|a|Cholelithiasis among male and female patients at the Royal Melbourne Hospital was studied, and the incidence of the disease in relation to various clinical and dietary factors is discussed. The patients are distinguished by sex and country of origin, a distinction being made between patients born in Australia and those born in southern Europe and now living in Australia. Appropriate control groups were also studied.It was shown that the incidence of cholelithiasis is higher in women than in men (3.0% as opposed to 0.7% in the Melbourne Hospital group), and higher among patients born in southern Europe than in Australia. A correlation was also established between marriage and the disease, and, in women, between having had children and the disease. The dietary investigations showed that in Australia those patients with cholelithiasis were fatter than the control patients. Equally well there seemed to be a strong family tendency to develop gallstones. No association was found between cholelithiasis and blood grouping. In the comparison of the southern European group and the Australian-born group it was shown that the former group had a higher incidence of the disease (9.3% as opposed to 2.3%), and that the overall incidence of cholelithiasis increased with age in men and was constant in women. However, when taken separately, the incidence in Australian female patients did increase with age, the higher proportion of women from southern Europe with the disease where the incidence was, in fact, evenly distributed in all age groups, accounting for this apparent constancy. It was also shown that a woman born in southern Europe increased the risk to herself of developing gallstones within two to five years of moving to Australia, and the contributory factors are discussed.

6424754|a|A case control study of gall stone disease in relation to diet, alcohol, and relative weight was undertaken. The study population comprised 267 hospital patients with newly diagnosed gall stone disease, 241 individually matched controls selected from the community, and 359 controls who were patients in hospital. Dietary intake was estimated with a quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the net association between individual nutrients and the risk of formation of gall stones. Variations in risk with sex and age were examined in the light of prior evidence of influences of sex hormones and age on hepatobiliary metabolism. In both sexes increased intake of alcohol was associated with a decreased risk of developing gall stones; increased intake of simple sugars in drinks and sweets was associated with an increased risk; and increased intake of energy or fat was associated with an increased risk in young subjects. Obesity was associated with an increased risk only in young women.

7367932|a|Clinical observations have suggested that gallstones are increased in frequency in Mexican-Americans compared to other ethnic groups. Past autopsy surveys have demonstrated a low prevalence in blacks compared to whites. We retrospectively reviewed 1,018 charts to study the prevalence of cholelithiasis in ambulatory women of these three racial/ethnic backgrounds. Mexican-American women were found to have a prevalence of gallbladder disease approximately three times that of black women, with Anglo prevalences falling in an intermediate range. The prevalence of cholelithiasis was also positively associated with increasing age and diabetes, but not with serum cholesterol, use of oral contraceptives or conjugated estrogens, parity, hypertension, menstrual status, or smoking. An association with obesity was shown but could not be shown to be independent of other risk factors.

3310613|a|A random sample of 4,807 men and women, aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years, who lived in the western part of Copenhagen County, was drawn from the National Central Person Registry. A total of 226 subjects who were not of Danish origin were omitted. The response rate was 78.8% (3,608/4,581). Each person had his or her gallbladder examined by ultrasonography. The examinations took place between November 1982 and February 1984. The overall prevalence of gallstone disease (cases with stones and cholecystectomized cases) in males aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years was 1.8%, 1.5%, 6.7%, and 12.9%, respectively. The corresponding prevalence in females was 4.8%, 6.1%, 14.4%, and 22.4%, respectively. Differences according to sex were significant in all age groups. Differences between the 40- and 50-year and 50- and 60-year age groups were significant in both sexes. Among subjects with gallstone disease, the disease was unknown to the proband in the majority of males and in the 30-year-old females, but only in half of the women aged 40, 50, and 60 years. The prevalence of clinically diagnosed gallstones was not significantly different between respondents and nonrespondents.

6720676|a|A population of female civil servants in Rome, Italy, was investigated to determine the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic gallstone disease and to define the associated factors. Field activities started in February 1981 and concluded in April 1982. Diagnosis was assessed by real time ultrasonography. Prevalence of gallstone disease increased with age from 2.5% in the 20- to 29-year-old age group to 25.0% in the 60- to 64-year-old age group, based on both presence of gallstones and history of cholecystectomy. Only one third of the women with gallstones had complained of at least one episode of biliary pain in the last five years. Frequency of "minor" dyspeptic symptoms was not different between women with and those without gallstones. In a multiple logistic function analysis, a positive association was found between age, body mass index, parity, and prevalence of gallstone disease. No association was demonstrated between the presence of gallstones or cholecystectomy and other major sex-specific factors, including age at menopause, use of oral contraceptives, and duration and frequency of menstrual cycle.

The prevalence of cholelithiasis in the same age span was 6.9% (4.5% in men and 8.9% in women). Prevalence of cholelithiasis increased with age in both sexes. Twenty-two percent of gallstone subjects suffered from biliary pain vs. 2% of subjects without gallstones. No difference was observed in the frequency of nonspecific symptoms between subjects with and without gallstones. Of the 132 gallstone subjects, 108 (82%) were not aware of having gallstones prior to the study. Prevalence of gallstone disease was found to be higher in obese and hypertriglyceridemic subjects and to increase with the number of pregnancies.

7363229|a|The prevalence of gallstones and gallbladder disease was studied in a rural Caucasian population. All the women aged 15 to 50 years were asked to complete a questionnaire, undergo cholecystography and keep a food record for 4 consecutive days. The gallbladder status was assessed in 73%. The prevalence of gallstones in this population, 167/1000, was considerably higher than that reported in the Framingham study (59/1000) but was not significantly different from that recently found in Micmac Indian women living nearby in Canada (211/1000). In contrast to all the other studies in Caucasian women, this study showed the prevalence of gallstones to peak between the ages of 30 and 39 years. The risk factors, controlled for age, were found to be obesity, a narrow range of daily energy intake, a low daily calcium intake and limited activity. Discriminant analysis showed that skinfold thickness and range of daily energy intake or all measures of obesity together correctly separated the persons with gallstones from those without.

Forty-one had previously been operated on for gallbladder disease. The prevalence of gallstone disease, on the basis of a positive finding at ultrasonography and cholecystography, was 11%. The predictive value of a positive finding at ultrasonography was 86%. Six out of 10 women with gallstone were classified as asymptomatic. Body weight, blood pressure, liver enzymes, fasting blood glucose, and blood lipids, including apolipoprotein-A, did not differ significantly in women with and without gallstone disease.

6738359|a|A total of 164 premenopausal female subjects were randomly selected for evaluation from a much larger pool of volunteers. The relationships between blood lipid and lipoprotein levels as dependent variables and cigarette smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption were determined from partial regression coefficients. A lower HDL-C level (10.1 mg/dL) was seen in smokers v nonsmokers. For each ounce of alcohol consumed, HDL-C level was higher by 2.8 mg/dL, and greater physical activity was associated with a higher HDL-C level of 8.6 mg/dL. An analysis of covariance with covariance adjustments for age and body fat revealed that smokers who regularly exercise or consume alcohol had significantly lower HDL-C levels than nonsmokers with similar habits. Subjects who both exercise and consume alcohol demonstrated higher HDL-C levels than those who indulge in one or the other separately. Results suggest that cigarette smoking may attenuate the effects of chronic exercise or alcohol consumption, or of both, to raise HDL-C levels. Also, chronic exercise and alcohol consumption may exert an additive effect, raising HDL-C level.

3968770|a|Coffee intake from three-day diet records was studied in association with plasma lipoprotein concentrations in a cross-sectional sample of 77 middle-aged American men to determine the significance and form of their interrelationships. The number of cups consumed per day correlated positively with levels of apolipoprotein B (r = .27, P less than or equal to .01) and became more strongly correlated when adjusted for age, cigarette use, adiposity, aerobic capacity, nutrient intake, and stress. Coffee intake also correlated with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when adjusted for these confounding factors. Graphic analyses revealed that plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein B and LDL-cholesterol were unrelated to intake of up to 2 cups of coffee per day and positively associated with intake exceeding 2 to 3 cups. These results suggest that male heavy coffee drinkers have lipoprotein profiles suggestive of increased cardiovascular disease risk, although the causality remains to be determined.

3259523|a|From a cross sectional study of gall stone disease ascertained by ultrasonography, the prevalence in relation to age at menarche, use of oral contraceptives, childbirths, breastfeeding, abortions, age at menopause, and menopausal hormone therapy was assessed. The random sample comprised 2301 women of Danish origin aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years, of whom 1765 (77%) attended the investigation. Gall stone disease was significantly associated with young age at menarche, abortions, and multiple childbirth. Use of oral contraceptives was significantly associated with gall stone disease in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis. Breastfeeding, age at menopause and menopausal hormone therapy were not associated with gall stones. These determining variables seemed sufficient to explain the higher prevalence of gall stone disease in women than in men.

3985293|a|During a 7 year period, 200 consecutive morbidly obese patients underwent a standardized gastric exclusion procedure. Group A was composed of the first 120 patients and Group B of the last 80 patients. In Group A, 22 patients had undergone a previous cholecystectomy and 12 patients had a cholecystectomy at the time of gastric exclusion because of positive diagnostic studies or palpation of stones. Of the remaining 87 patients in this initial group who were at risk for the development of gallbladder disease, 24 (27.6 percent) required a cholecystectomy in the first 3 postoperative years (mean 15.6 months). Twelve patients had acute cholecystitis, 3 patients had choledocholithiasis, and 1 patient had acute gallstone pancreatitis. In Group B, 18 patients had a previous cholecystectomy, 15 had positive diagnostic studies (ultrasonography and oral cholecystography) preoperatively, and 47 had negative studies. Cholecystectomy was routinely performed at the time of gastric exclusion surgery in the 62 patients with gallbladders in Group B. Of the 47 patients who had normal preoperative diagnostic studies, 40 (85.1 percent) had abnormal histologic findings in the gallbladder. Only seven patients in Group B had a normal gallbladder (14.7 percent). We conclude that gallbladder disease is considerably more frequent in the morbidly obese population (91.3 percent) than has previously been recognized, that diagnostic studies are frequently inaccurate, and that postoperative gallbladder disease is common (28.7 percent). On the basis of these results, routine cholecystectomy at the time of gastric exclusion surgery is recommended.

6350364|a|The distribution of adipose tissue thickness, fat cell weight (FCW), and number (FCN) were studied in four regions in randomly selected middle-aged men and women and in 930 obese individuals. Both the obese and the randomly selected men were found to have the largest adipose tissue thickness in the abdominal region. Women, however, showed a relative preponderance for the gluteal and femoral regions. FCW increased with expanding body fat up to a maximal size of approximately 0.7-0.8 micrograms/cell in each region. After this increase in FCW, a more rapid increase in FCN was found. For the same degree of relative overweight, men had higher triglyceride, fasting glucose, and insulin levels; higher sums of glucose and insulin levels during an oral glucose tolerance test; and higher blood pressure. Furthermore, elevated fasting glucose levels (greater than 7.4 mM) occurred twice as often in the males. These differences between males and females persisted even after body fat matching. A male risk profile was seen in women characterized by abdominal obesity (high waist/hip circumference ratio) as compared to women with the typical peripheral obesity. Stepwise multiple regression analyses in both women and men showed the obesity complications to be associated in a first step to waist/hip circumference or body fat and in a second to abdominal fat cell size. It may thus be concluded that: (a) In both obese and nonobese subjects, regional differences exist between the sexes with regard to adipose tissue distribution. (b) Moderate expansion of body fat is mainly due to FCW enlargement, which is subsequently followed by increased FCN. (c) Men and women with a male abdominal type of obesity are more susceptible to the effect of excess body fat on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.

Bile cholesterol saturation index was negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol. It was positively correlated with plasma triglycerides and with total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol.

3532765|a|Impaired gallbladder contraction has been previously shown in diabetes mellitus. In this study gallbladder contraction was measured by real-time ultrasonography in 20 subjects (eight healthy controls and 12 diabetics) studied twice on 2 consecutive days, before and after intravenous metoclopramide injection. Contraction was expressed by fasting gallbladder volume and residual gallbladder volume after maximal emptying. Fasting volumes were significantly larger in the diabetics (22.4 +/- 2.1 ml) as compared to the controls (16.15 +/- 1.69 ml) (p less than 0.001). Residual volumes were also significantly larger in the diabetics (12.4 +/- 2.09 ml) as compared to the controls (5.6 +/- 0.58 ml) (p less than 0.001). The rate of gallbladder emptying was significantly (p less than 0.001) slower in the diabetics (0.0326 +/- 0.0056) as compared to the controls (0.0498 +/- 0.0066), but no difference could be shown in the diabetics after administration of metoclopramide (0.0368 +/- 0.0048). No difference was found in the diabetic group before and after injection of 10 mg metoclopramide. The results imply that diabetic cholecystoparesis is not entirely related to autonomic neuropathy since it is not corrected by metoclopramide, a known cholinergic stimulant.

3712053|a|Gallbladder emptying and filling was studied in eight diabetic and six normal control patients. None of the patients had gallstones. Cholescintigraphy was performed using [99mTc]disofenin, and gallbladder emptying was studied using a 45-min i.v. infusion of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (OP-CCK) 20 ng/kg X hr. The peak filling rate was greater in diabetic than in normal subjects; however, emptying of the gallbladder in response to OP-CCK was significantly less in the diabetic subjects (51.6 +/- 10.4% compared with 77.2 +/- 4.9%). When the diabetic group was subdivided into obese and nonobese diabetics, the obese diabetics had a much lower percentage of emptying than the nonobese diabetics (30.0 +/- 10.4% compared with 73.1 +/- 9.3%). These findings suggest that obese diabetics may have impaired emptying of the gallbladder even in the absence of gallstones. The more rapid rate of gallbladder filling in obesity may indicate hypotonicity of the gallbladder. The combination of these abnormalities may predispose the obese diabetic to the development of gallstones.

685938|a|Since the prevalence of gallstones is higher in diabetics than in controls and since cholelithiasis is often associated with supersaturated bile, we measured bile lipid composition and bile acid pool size in 8 patients with juvenile diabetes, 16 with maturity-onset diabetes, and 10 control subjects. Bile lipid composition was expressed as "saturation index." In the maturity-onset diabetics the saturation index (1.60 +/- 0.45 SDM) was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) than that in the controls (0.82 +/- 0.20) and in patients with juvenile diabetes (0.75 +/- 0.24). The absolute values for biliary bile acid concentration were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) in the maturity-onset diabetics than in the other two groups. There were no differences in either the proportion of the individual biliary bile acids or the size of the bile acid pool between the three groups. The results suggest that the incidence of cholelithiasis in diabetes is associated with the secretion of a supersaturated bile only in the maturity-onset subgroup.

468079|a|Duodenal bile from 27 diabetes was compared with samples from healthy subjects matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Cholesterol saturation and the molar percentages of bile acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol were not significantly different. Most bile samples were supersaturated in both groups. The maturity onset diabetics who were almost all obese had more saturated bile than the slimmer juvenile onset patients. Body fatness and plasma triglyceride levels were both positively correlated with the cholesterol saturation of bile in the controls but not in the diabetics. Bile was less concentrated in female diabetics than in controls, which is consistent with impaired gallbladder emptying. It is possible that the increased prevalence of gallstones in diabetics is due not so much to diabetes itself as to the frequently associated obesity.

870827|a|In view of the reported excess prevalence of atherosclerosis and cholelithiasis in diabetes, we investigated several aspects of cholesterol metabolism under metabolic ward conditions in six Pima Indians with maturity-onset diabetes mellitus. Cholesterol balance (13.5 versus 11.0 mg per kilogram per day, P less than 0.05), fecal bile acid excretion (415 versus 261 mg per day, P less than 0.05), bile acid pool size (3150 versus 1950 mg, P less than 0.05), fasting plasma cholesterol (193 versus 160 mg per deciliter, P less than 0.05) and plasma triglycerides (251 versus 150 mg per deciliter, P less than 0.05) were higher during uncontrolled hyperglycemia than during relative euglycemia on insulin. The increased plasma lipid levels and total cholesterol synthesis during hyperglycemia may contribute to the acceleration of atherosclerosis in diabetes mellitus. Gallbladder bile was significantly more saturated with cholesterol (181 per cent versus 114 per cent, P less than 0.05) during insulin treatment than during uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Bile lipid composition was thus more favorable to cholesterol precipitation and gallstone formation during insulin treatment than in the untreated diabetic state.

6093367|a|A herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) mutant, ts1204, which has a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation located within genome map coordinates 0.318 to 0.324, close to but outside the coding sequences of the glycoprotein gB gene, has been characterised. Although this mutant adsorbed to the cell surface at the nonpermissive temperature (NPT), it failed to penetrate the cell membrane. As a consequence of this defect, high multiplicities of infection of ts1204 blocked subsequent infection of cells by wild-type HSV-1. By contrast, at the NPT, superinfection of cells with HSV-2 was not inhibited by prior infection with ts1204. The penetration defect could be overcome either by brief incubation of mutant virus-infected cells at the permissive temperature, or by treatment of the cells with polyethylene glycol, a compound which promotes fusion of membranes. Upon continued incubation of ts1204-infected cells at the NPT, low numbers of capsids were assembled. Although these capsids all had some internal structure, they did not contain DNA. Another mutant, ts1208, which lies in the same complementation group as ts1204, penetrated cells normally at the NPT, but like ts1204, had a defect in the formation of functional capsids. Evidence presented in this paper suggests that the gene in which the ts1204 and ts1208 lesions map encodes a structural polypeptide.

3039500|a|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is known to bud from the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. The structural gene for the glycoprotein gB, which is essential for virus entry and cell fusion induced by HSV type 1, has been cloned in a transient expression vector containing the adenovirus major late promoter, tripartite leader sequence, and VARNA (a special RNA in adenovirus-infected cells) genes. Synthesis and glycosylation of glycoprotein gB was observed in COS-1 cells transfected with the vector containing the gB gene. Removal of a 3' fragment of the cloned gene resulted in the synthesis and secretion of a truncated gB glycoprotein. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that the expressed glycoprotein was localized in the nuclear envelope as well as in the cell surface. The expressed gB-1 glycoprotein was biologically active and induced fusion of cells to produce polykaryons. These data show that HSV glycoprotein gB expressed from cloned gene can be used as a model to study targeting of proteins into the nuclear envelope as well as cell fusion induced by the virus.

3037783|a|The major glycoproteins gI, gIII, and gIV of bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) were found to induce high levels of antibody in cattle which could neutralize virus and participate in antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity of BHV-1-infected cells. Immunized animals were fully protected from disease, using a BHV-1/Pasteurella haemolytica aerosol challenge model but not from infection with the virus. Thus, virus could still replicate in the nasal passages of immunized animals, although to a lesser extent than in placebo-treated animals or animals immunized with a commercial killed whole virus vaccine. Systemic spread of the virus in immunized animals did not appear to occur since there was not a dramatic alteration of leukocyte function following challenge. These results suggest that any one of the three major BHV-1 glycoproteins may be useful as a subunit vaccine either individually or in combination.

53206|a|The interaction of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus and susceptible host cells was examined to determine whether an infected cell could be destroyed by humoral immune mechanisms before or after the transmission of virus to susceptible adjacent cells. Viral antigens were detectable on cell membranes at 6 h postinfection, but cells were not susceptible to antibody-complement lysis until 10 h postinfection. Intracellular infectious virus was also detectable at 10 h postinfection, and transmission to adjacent cells by the intracellular route began at this time. Extracellular virus was not detectable until 12 to 13 h postinfection. By the continual addition of antibody and complement, virus dissemination could be reduced more than 50-fold. These results support the hypothesis that the humoral immune mechanism may be involved in the recovery from herpesvirus infections.

When used to study the immune response of mice to the viral glycoproteins, it was found that both gB and gD induce a delayed type hypersensitivity response and both also induce an antibody response, but only the cell line expressing gD could stimulate the production of neutralizing antibody. Virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognized gB expressed by the cell line and this line could also induce CTLs in mice. Recognition of gD by major histocompatibility complex class I restricted CTLs was never seen. Vaccination of mice with the cell lines provided protection from viral challenge and inhibited the establishment of a latent infection, although gD proved to be the better protective immunogen.

4033797|a|Studies on erythrocytes have shown that the formation of the membrane attack complex on a cell surface inevitably results in lysis. However, it is known that nucleated cells are much more difficult to kill with complement, although the molecular basis of this resistance has never been established. We have shown that a very early intracellular event, occurring within seconds of formation of the attack complex in the membrane, is a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+, which can activate cell responses without cell death 5,6. Here we report the use of a monoclonal antibody to the terminal complement component C9, quantified by 125I and visualized by fluorescein, to demonstrate a protection mechanism in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) attacked by complement, involving removal of the attack complex by vesiculation. Concomitantly, there is a Ca2+-dependent activation of reactive oxygen metabolite production without cell lysis. These findings have important implications in the evolutionary and pathological significance of the terminal components of the complement pathway.

3670292|a|We describe a simple calcium phosphate transfection protocol and neo marker vectors that achieve highly efficient transformation of mammalian cells. In this protocol, the calcium phosphate-DNA complex is formed gradually in the medium during incubation with cells and precipitates on the cells. The crucial factors for obtaining efficient transformation are the pH (6.95) of the buffer used for the calcium phosphate precipitation, the CO2 level (3%) during the incubation of the DNA with the cells, and the amount (20 to 30 micrograms) and the form (circular) of DNA. In sharp contrast to the results with circular DNA, linear DNA is almost inactive. Under these conditions, 50% of mouse L(A9) cells can be stably transformed with pcDneo, a simian virus 40-based neo (neomycin resistance) marker vector. The NIH3T3, C127, CV1, BHK, CHO, and HeLa cell lines were transformed at efficiencies of 10 to 50% with this vector and the neo marker-incorporated pcD vectors that were used for the construction and transduction of cDNA expression libraries as well as for the expression of cloned cDNA in mammalian cells.

3468045|a|We have constructed two new recombinant cosmid vectors that can be used for direct expression and amplification of genomic DNA in mammalian cells. The vectors allow cloning of DNA fragments up to 40 kb in size. Each carries two dominant selectable markers: the bacterial neo gene and the mouse DHFR gene. In the first vector, pCV001, the neo and DHFR genes are regulated by the SV40 early promoter, and in the second, pAVCV007, by the avian sarcoma virus LTR promoter. The neo gene served as a dominant marker for the selection of transformants in all mammalian cell types, and we demonstrate here that the LTR promoter significantly improved the efficiency of DNA-mediated transformation of a human cell line. We isolated the human growth hormone genes from genomic libraries prepared in these cosmid vectors and used these recombinant cosmids for direct transfections of cultured cells. Selection of transformants in increasing concentrations of methotrexate led to the outgrowth of resistant cell populations carrying amplified copies of the DHFR marker. A 40-1000-fold coamplification of the hGH genes was observed in the different transfected cell lines, along with a corresponding increase in transcription and translation activity of the hGH gene. Gene amplification could be achieved in both DHFR deficient or normal cell lines. High level expression of a cloned gene mediated by gene amplification should facilitate characterization of DNA sequences, as well as isolation of specific gene products for biochemical, functional, and pharmacological studies.

205802|a|The determination of the total 5,224 base-pair DNA sequence of the virus SV40 has enabled us to locate precisely the known genes on the genome. At least 15.2% of the genome is presumably not translated into polypeptides. Particular points of interest revealed by the complete sequence are the initiation of the early t and T antigens at the same position and the fact that the T antigen is coded by two non-contiguous regions of the genome; the T antigen mRNA is spliced in the coding region. In the late region the gene for the major protein VP1 overlaps those for proteins VP2 and VP3 over 122 nucleotides but is read in a different frame. The almost complete amino acid sequences of the two early proteins as well as those of the late proteins have been deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The mRNAs for the latter three proteins are presumably spliced out of a common primary RNA transcript. The use of degenerate codons is decidedly non-random, but is similar for the early and late regions. Codons of the type NUC, NCG and CGN are absent or very rare.

6328323|a|Receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins or for the third component of complement (C3) are present on a variety of circulating and fixed tissue cells including granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes and glomerular epithelial cells. Cells which lack Fc receptors may express them after infection by herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, HSV-2, cytomegalovirus or varicella zoster virus. We recently reported that infection by HSV-1 induces both Fc and C3 receptors on human endothelial cells. Glycoprotein E of HSV-1 has been shown to function as an Fc receptor. We now demonstrate that glycoprotein C (gC) of HSV-1 functions as a C3b receptor. This receptor appears following HSV-1, but not HSV-2, infection. Detection of the C3b receptor is blocked by monoclonal antibodies to glycoprotein C (gC) of HSV-1, but not by monoclonal antibodies to other HSV-1 glycoproteins. In addition, the MP mutant of HSV-1, which lacks gC, fails to express a C3b receptor. These results assign a new function of gC of HSV-1 and demonstrate potentially important differences between HSV-1 and HSV-2 glycoproteins.

The PMN from all 29 individuals tested could mediate ADCC in the presence of a standard human anit-HSV serum. Since PMN are prominent cells early in herpes lesions, it was hypothesized that because ADCC could represent an in vitro model for antiviral recovery, perhaps the efficacy of PMN at mediating ADCC might be impaired in those subjects to frequent recrudescent herpes. However, evidence for the hypothesis was not obtained since the PMN from individuals with frequent, infrequent, or unrecorded herpes labialis all showed approximately the same activity at mediating ADCC. Alternative ways in which PMN could be involved in antiviral recovery were discussed.

Polyclonal rabbit antibodies specific for glycoprotein D (gD) or gC and three monoclonal mouse antibodies specific for gD-1 or gC-1 most effectively inhibited HSV-1 adsorption. Antibodies of other specificities had less or no inhibitory activity despite demonstrable binding of the antibodies to virions. Nonimmune rabbit immunoglobulin G and Fc fragments partially inhibited adsorption when used at relatively high concentrations. These results suggest involvement of gD, gC, and perhaps gE (the Fc-binding glycoprotein) in adsorption. The monoclonal anti-gD antibodies that were most effective at inhibiting HSV-1 adsorption had only weak neutralizing activity. The most potent anti-gD neutralizing antibodies had little effect on adsorption at concentrations significantly higher than those required for neutralization. This suggests that, although some anti-gD antibodies can neutralize virus by blocking adsorption, a more important mechanism of neutralization by anti-gD antibodies may be interference with a step subsequent to adsorption, possibly penetration.

3037552|a|Certain monoclonal antibodies specific for glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus have potent neutralizing activity but fail to block attachment of virus to cells. Here we have investigated the fate of neutralized and infectious virus after attachment to primate cells. Infectious virions fused with the cell surface such that naked nucleocapsids were detectable in the cytoplasm near or just under the plasma membrane. Neutralized virions did not fuse with the cell. They remained attached to the cell surface and could be rendered infectious by treatment with polyethylene glycol. We conclude that some anti-glycoprotein D neutralizing antibodies can inhibit the penetration of herpes simplex virus by blocking fusion of the virion envelope with the plasma membrane. These results identify a pathway of entry that initiates successful herpes simplex virus infection and a step in this pathway that is highly sensitive to neutralizing antibodies. A role for glycoprotein D in virion-cell fusion is indicated.

3016991|a|The map position of the coding sequence of glycoprotein H of herpes simplex virus type 1 was determined by marker transfer studies in which DNA fragments cloned from a virus resistant to neutralisation by an anti-gH monoclonal antibody were used to transfer antibody resistance to wild type virus DNA following cotransfection. The gH coding sequence was mapped to the BglII "m" fragment of HSV-1 DNA (map coordinates 0.27-0.312), confirming the map position previously determined by intertypic recombinant analysis (Buckmaster et al., 1984). The complete nucleotide sequence of the BglII "m" fragment revealed two large open reading frames in addition to the thymidine kinase gene. The open reading frame lying immediately 3' of the thymidine kinase gene has a predicted translation product with the features of a large glycoprotein. This open reading frame translates to an amino acid sequence of 90,323 mol wt with a signal peptide, a membrane anchor sequence, a large external domain containing potential N-glycosylation sites, and a charged C- terminal cytoplasmic domain. We suppose that this amino acid sequence corresponds to gH of HSV-1, and A. Davison (personal communication) has noted the existence of homologous glycoproteins predicted from the nucleotide sequences of Varicella-zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus. The properties of monoclonal antibody LP11, directed against gH show remarkable similarities to the properties for gD antibodies. LP11 efficiently neutralizes virus infectivity, blocks cell fusion by syncytial virus strains, and inhibits the formation of plaques when added to cell monolayers after infection. These similarities in antibody activity imply functional relatedness between gH and gD of herpes simplex virus.

Our results demonstrate that butyrate affects the early stages of gene activity following DNA uptake at least two levels. First, the number of cells able to express foreign DNA increases from 10% to up to 40%. Second, there is an increase in enhancer-dependent transcription, approximately 30 fold in HeLa cells, involving the SV40 early promoter. Stable transformation efficiencies increase to 4% and 10% in HeLa S3 and monkey kidney CV-1 cells, respectively. Finally, expression of integrated recombinant plasmid genes is reinducible by a second treatment five weeks after initial exposure to this agent.

6294651|a|We characterized the transcriptional activity of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of Rous sarcoma virus by constructing a recombinant plasmid, pRSVcat, in which bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT; acetyl-CoA:chloramphenicol 3-O-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.28) coding sequences are placed under LTR control. We find that the LTR directs relatively high levels of CAT synthesis within 48 hr after calcium phosphate-mediated introduction of this plasmid into CV-1 monkey kidney cells, chicken embryo fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary cells, HeLa cells, or mouse NIH/3T3 cells. The level of CAT synthesis is 3-fold higher in CV-1 cells and up to 10-fold higher in HeLa and mouse NIH/3T3 cells than after transfection with a related vector, pSV2cat, carrying CAT sequences under control of the simian virus 40 early promoter. We have shown, by primer extension, that the amounts of CAT-specific mRNAs encoded by pRSVcat and pSV2cat correlate with the levels of CAT enzyme activity. By both S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension, we have demonstrated that the start site for RNA transcription within the LTR of pRSVcat corresponds to previous mapping data. We estimated transfection efficiencies by monitoring immunofluorescence induced by a rhodamine-labeled CAT antibody. Our results indicate that the Rous sarcoma virus LTR can direct synthesis of high levels of functional mRNA and has a wide expression range. The observed high transcriptional activity of the LTR is significant because it has been postulated that this LTR promotes activity of adjacent cellular oncogenes.

3035221|a|We detected a glycoprotein on the surface of cells infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) which, in conjunction with gE, binds immunoglobulin G (IgG). The novel glycoprotein, which has an apparent molecular mass of 70 kilodaltons and was provisionally named g70, was first detected in extracts of HSV-1-infected cells labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination and precipitated with rabbit sera or IgG and protein A-Sepharose. In subsequent experiments, g70 and gE were coprecipitated from extracts of HSV-1-infected cells labeled with [35S]methionine, [35S]cysteine, or 14C-amino acids. We were unable to precipitate a polypeptide analogous to g70 or gE from extracts of HSV-2-infected cells with rabbit IgG and protein A-Sepharose. Partial proteolytic peptide analysis indicated that g70 is structurally distinct from gE and gI). In addition, g70 was electrophoretically distinct from the HSV-1 Us4 glycoprotein gG. HSV-1 gE, expressed in mouse cells transfected with the gE gene, was not precipitated with rabbit IgG, nor could these cells bind radiolabeled IgG, suggesting that gE alone cannot act as an IgG (Fc) receptor. This result, coupled with the findings that gE and g70 are coprecipitated with IgG and with an anti-gE monoclonal antibody, suggests that gE and g70 form a complex which binds IgG. The electrophoretic mobilities of g70 molecules induced by different strains of HSV-1 differed markedly, arguing that g70 is encoded by the virus and is not a cellular protein induced by virus infection.

3023931|a|The herpes simplex virus mutants KOS1.1 ts756 and HFEM tsLB2 express temperature-sensitive ICP4 proteins that are not localized properly to the cell nucleus at the nonpermissive temperature. In these infected cells at the nonpermissive temperature, nuclear localization of at least two other viral proteins, ICP0 and ICP8, is impaired. Replacement of the mutated sequences in the ICP4 gene of tsLB2 restored proper nuclear localization of all of the proteins. The ICP0 and ICP8 proteins expressed in cells transfected with their individual genes were localized to the cell nucleus. Therefore, in infected cells, the mutant ICP4 gene product appears to be the primary defect which leads to the block in nuclear localization of the other proteins. One viral protein, ICP27, was not inhibited for nuclear localization in these cells. These data indicate that there are at least two pathways for nuclear localization of HSV proteins, one of which is inhibited by the mutant ICP4 protein. The mutant ICP4 protein may define a probe for one of the pathways of nuclear localization of proteins.

3306408|a|Rates of protein folding reactions vary considerably. Some denatured proteins regain the native conformation within milliseconds or seconds, whereas others refold very slowly in the time range of minutes or hours. Varying folding rates are observed not only for different proteins, but can also be detected for single polypeptide species. This originates from the co-existence of fast- and slow-folding forms of the unfolded protein, which regain the native state with different rates. The proline hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for this heterogeneity. It assumes that the slow-folding molecules possess non-native isomers of peptide bonds between proline and another residue, and that crucial steps in the refolding of the slow-folding molecules are limited in rate by the slow reisomerization of such incorrect proline peptide bonds. Recently the enzyme peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) was discovered and purified from pig kidney. It catalyses efficiently the cis in equilibrium trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides. Here we show that it also catalyses slow steps in the refolding of a number of proteins of which fast- and slow-folding species have been observed and where it was suggested that proline isomerization was involved in slow refolding. The efficiency of catalysis depends on the accessibility for the isomerase of the particular proline peptide bonds in the refolding protein chain.

6969228|a|This communication deals with the question of which of the viral antigens constitutes the targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) generated against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The approach used was, first, to compare cytotoxicity of CTL against target cells infected with virus in the presence of tunicamycin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose, which are known to inhibit glycoprotein synthesis, and second, to compare cytotoxicity of CTL against target cells infected with wild-type HSV-1 with that against target cells infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of HSV-1 which, at the nonpermissive temperature, exhibits diminished glycoprotein synthesis. The results show that glycoprotein expression is required for the demonstration of cytotoxic activity of CTL. The level of cytotoxicity against the temperature-sensitive HSV-1 target at the nonpermissive temperature was reduced and correlated with the level of expression of the major envelope glycoprotein region (VP123; molecular weight = 123,000) at the target cell surface as measured serologically by antibody binding studies. The results were interpreted to indicate that HSV-1-induced glycoproteins are the target antigens for anti-HSV CTL and that the principal viral antigens recognized by the CTL may be glycoproteins of the VP123 region.

The individual contributions of the two asparagine-linked glycans of G protein to cell surface expression were assessed by site-directed mutagenesis of the coding sequence to eliminate one or the other or both of the glycosylation sites. One oligosaccharide at either position was sufficient for cell surface expression of G protein in transfected cells, and the rates of oligosaccharide processing were similar to the rate observed for wild-type protein. However, the nonglycosylated G protein synthesized when both glycosylation sites were eliminated did not reach the cell surface. This protein did appear to reach a Golgi-like region, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, however, and was modified with palmitic acid. It was also apparently not subject to increased proteolytic breakdown.

198812|a|Some of the factors that regulate membrane fusion resulting in polykaryocyte formationhave been investigated, using the model system of human cells infected with mutants of herpes simplex virus (HSV). One of the mutant viruses used in this study (MP) failed to produce the viral glycoprotein designated C2--a nonlethal defect that has previously been correlated with the polykaryocyte-inducing phenotype of this and other mutant strains (wild-type strains of HSV usually induce the aggregation of infected cells rather than their fusion). The other mutant virus (tsB5), a temperature-sensitive conditional-lethal mutant, failed to produce glycoprotein B2 at non-permissive temperature, whereas the synthesis of all other viral products appeared to be normal. We produced and isolated seven recombinants of MP and tsB5 that expressed both of the parental alterations in glycoprotein synthesis. All of the re-combinant viruses induced the fusion of infected cells at 34 degrees (correlated with the absence of C2 expression) but were unable to cause cell fusion at 39 degrees (correlated with the absence of C2 and of B2 expression), even after infection at multiplicities high enough to ensure that all cells in the cultures synthesized viral macromolecules. These results and studies on the dominance or recessiveness of the fusion-inducing phenotype in mixed infections provide evidence that glycoprotein B2 plays a critical role in the promotion of cell fusion and that glycoprotein C2 can act to suppress fusion.

6275094|a|An electrophoretic analysis of radioactively labeled, purified, "empty" and DNA-containing infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virions revealed the presence of 25 to 33 structural (virion) polypeptides. A total of 11 of these polypeptides could be labeled with [3H]glucosamine and were identified as glycoproteins. In addition to the 25 structural polypeptides, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus infected cells also contained at least 15 nonstructural (nonvirion) polypeptides that were not present in purified virions. Expression of the viral polypeptides in infected cells was controlled temporally. Thus, most viral polypeptides could be categorized as "alpha" (immediate early), "beta" (early), or "gamma" (late) on the basis of their order of appearance in infected cells and whether their syntheses were dependent upon prior viral protein or DNA synthesis. None of the glycoproteins belongs to the alpha class, although at least one (GVP11) was synthesized in the absence of viral DNA synthesis. Serum from a cow in which infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus lesions were reactivated by dexamethasone precipitated both structural and nonstructural polypeptides.

7143563|a|Glycoprotein GVP-11 (molecular weight, 71,500), induced by bovine herpesvirus type 1, was detected on the external surface of infected cells. It could be categorized as an "early" or "beta" class protein since it was synthesized early in the infectious process and its expression was not dependent upon prior viral DNA replication in the infected cells. Monoclonal antibodies directed against GVP-11 immunoprecipitated that glycoprotein and some low-molecular-weight polypeptides from infected cells labeled with either [35S]methionine or [3H]glucosamine. Immunoprecipitation of extracts from cells surface labeled with 125I yielded an additional 138,000-molecular-weight polypeptide. Tunicamycin- or bromovinyl deoxyuridine-treated infected cells yielded polypeptides that were smaller in size than corresponding glycoproteins in untreated cells. Tunicamycin-sensitive glycosylation appeared to be necessary for the expression of the glycoproteins on the surface of the infected cells. The monoclonal antibodies directed against GVP-11 and serum from an immune cow could participate in antibody- and complement-mediated immunocytolysis of infected cells, and this immunocytolysis could be enhanced by arresting cells in the early phase of viral gene expression by treatment with inhibitors of viral DNA synthesis.

3080749|a|The third external domain of major histocompatibility class I antigens has a highly conserved disulfide bridge between cysteine-203 and cysteine-259. To elucidate the functional significance of this disulfide bridge, we have produced a mutant H-2Ld gene by site-directed mutagenesis in which the codon for cysteine-203 is changed to a codon for serine, which is unable to form a disulfide bridge. The mutant H-2Ld gene was introduced into mouse L cells and its expression has been studied. No measurable expression of the H-2Ld antigen was detected on the cell surface of the transformants by antibody-binding assays. However, a large quantity of the mutant H-2Ld antigen was found in the cytoplasm of the transformants as observed by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled lysate and by immunocytochemistry of membrane-permeabilized cells, using an antibody specific for the first external domain of the H-2Ld antigen. The mutant antigen was glycosylated and associated, at least in part, with beta 2-microglobulin. Subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that the transport of the antigen was blocked between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. It is concluded that structural integrity of the third external domain is a prerequisite for intracellular transport of class I antigens. On the basis of these findings we suggest that the domain structure containing the disulfide bridge serves as a signal structure necessary for receptor-mediated intracellular transport and that this requirement is the evolutionary basis for high conservation of similar structures present throughout the immunoglobulin supergene family.

Antibodies against gp 117 and gp 71 glycoproteins first showed pronounced ring-like nuclear fluorescence at 4 hours post-infection (PI), followed by staining of the perinuclear region, presumably the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, antibody against gp 87 produced staining in cell-to-cell junctional areas at 3 hours PI before any staining close to the nucleus. The expression of the 3 glycoproteins at the surface of the infected cells was confirmed by the use of monoclonal antibodies having neutralizing activity, but not by non-neutralizing antibodies against gp 117 and gp 71. Non-neutralizing antibody against gp 87 detected the surface fluorescence only in those cells showing marked degeneration. Inhibition of glycosylation of the viral glycoproteins with tunicamycin (TM) was followed by interference with transport of gp 117 and gp 87 to the plasma membrane. On the other hand, gp 71 was incorporated into the plasma membrane despite the lack of N-linked glycosylation.

Expression vectors containing the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) cDNA plus the complete gB1 gene or a truncated gene lacking the 194 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of gB1 were transfected into CHO DHFR-deficient cells. Radioimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that the complete gB1 protein expressed in CHO cell lines was cell associated, whereas the truncated protein was secreted from the cells due to deletion of the transmembrane and C-terminal domains of gB1. Cells expressing the truncated gB1 protein were subjected to stepwise methotrexate selection, and a cell line was isolated in which the gB1 gene copy number had been amplified 10-fold and the level of expression of gB1 had increased over 60-fold. The truncated gB1 protein was purified from medium conditioned by the amplified cell line. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of this purified protein identified the signal peptide cleavage site and predicted the cleavage of a 30-amino-acid signal sequence from the primary protein. The immunogenicity of the truncated gB1 protein was also tested in mice, and high levels of antibody and protection from virus challenge were observed.

3787251|a|The presurface (preS) proteins of hepatitis B virus are structural components of the viral envelope that may play important roles in virion assembly and infectivity. They are specified by a large open reading frame that includes the coding region for the major surface (S) protein in its 3' half. Translation of the preS proteins initiates upstream from the S region, giving rise to proteins that are composed of the S domain and an additional 163 (preS1) or 55 (preS2) amino acids. Little is known about the biosynthesis and assembly of these proteins. The expression of the S and preS1 proteins was examined by transfecting cultured mammalian cells with viral DNA and injecting synthetic messenger RNA's into Xenopus oocytes. In contrast to the proteins encoded by the S region, the preS1 proteins are not detectably secreted into the culture medium. Furthermore, when the S and preS1 proteins are synthesized together, secretion of the S proteins is specifically and strongly inhibited. The results suggest a unique molecular interaction during secretion of the S and preS proteins that may be important for virus assembly.

Low levels of nucleocapsid (N) protein were detected on the surface of VSV-infected cells, but N protein could not be detected on the plasma membrane of transfected EL4 cells. Intracellular N protein was detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunoprecipitation in some of the transfected cell lines but not in others, unless the transfected genes were induced by sodium butyrate. However, all of the stably transfected EL4 cell lines expressing the VSV-Indiana N protein were efficiently lysed by serotype-specific and cross-reactive anti-VSV cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Primary cross-reactive anti-VSV CTLs appeared to be specific solely for N protein, based on cold-target competition assays using infected and transfected target cells. Cell lines expressing 100- to 1,000-fold less N protein than did VSV-infected cells were efficiently lysed by both primary and secondary anti-VSV CTLs. Cell lines expressing 100-fold less G protein than did VSV-infected cells were not lysed by either population of effectors. Significantly, cold-target competition studies with secondary CTLs demonstrated that N protein-expressing cell lines were more efficient competitors than were VSV-infected cells even though the latter expressed 100- to 1,000-fold more N protein. This was not an artifact of viral infection since infection of the transfected cell lines did not affect their ability to compete. The possibility that cell lines constitutively expressing internal virus proteins present antigen more effectively than infected cells do is discussed.

217506|a|A variety of specific immunological mechanisms have been shown to be effective at neutralizing herpesviruses or destroying herpesvirus infected cells. These include both humoral and cell mediated immune responses or combinations thereof. Thus, it is genarlly accepted that humoral immunity is probably responsible for preventing reinfection whereas cellular immunity, mediated by T lymphocytes or by the interaction of antibody and Fc receptor bearing cells, is more important in recovery from infections. In addition to these specific responses to herpesvirus infection, a number of nonspecific cellular and humoral components have been shown to inhibit the progression of virus replication and therefore, have been implicated in assisting the host in the recovery process. The various interactions and counteractions between the various nonspecific and specific components of the immune response are discussed with respect to their role in recovery from both primary and recurrent disease as well as how they may eventually be manipulated so as to control herpesvirus recrudescent disease.

The mutant, designated HSV-1[HFEM]tsB5, fails to accumulate VP7(B2) at nonpermissive temperature and produces virions that lack detectable quantities of this glycoprotein and that have very low specific infectivity. The poor infectivity of the virions is most readily explained by failure of penetration into the host cell rather than by failure of adsorption to cells because it was shown that the VP7(B2)-deficient virions can bind to cells and that polyethylene glycol, an agent known to promote membrane fusion, can significantly enhance infectivity of the adsorbed virions.

3457370|a|In an effort to understand the factors that influence protein glycosylation, we are studying the expression of the chicken ovalbumin gene in a heterologous cell. Ovalbumin synthesized in mouse L-353 cells is glycosylated, as judged by incorporation of [3H]mannose and susceptibility to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases. Sequential digestion of ovalbumin synthesized in L cells with trypsin and chymotrypsin yields material migrating as one peak on HPLC coincident with similarly treated material from chicken ovalbumin, suggesting that the protein synthesized in L cells is glycosylated at the correct site. As in the case of chicken ovalbumin, the protein synthesized in L cells contains large amounts of hybrid oligosaccharides. Approximately 50% of the [3H]mannose incorporated into ovalbumin secreted by L cells is found in such hybrid structures. These results suggest that it is the polypeptide chain of ovalbumin that is responsible for proper glycosylation and subsequent processing of a substantial fraction of the oligosaccharide chains to hybrid structures. However, differences do exist between ovalbumin synthesized in L cells and the chicken glycoprotein. The hybrid oligosaccharides of ovalbumin secreted by L cells are completely sialylated and do not contain a bisecting GlcNAc residue, distinguishing them from hybrid chains in chicken ovalbumin. In addition to high-mannose and hybrid oligosaccharide chains, ovalbumin synthesized in L cells contains oligosaccharides of the complex type. To date, this type of sugar chain has not been observed in chicken ovalbumin. These differences in fine structure, between the oligosaccharides derived from ovalbumin secreted by L cells and those known to be present in the chicken egg glycoprotein, suggest that the cell type also plays a role in oligosaccharide processing.

6286831|a|A bacterial gene (neo) conferring resistance to neomycin-kanamycin antibiotics has been inserted into SV40 hybrid plasmid vectors and introduced into cultured mammalian cells by DNA transfusion. Whereas normal cells are killed by the antibiotic G418, those that acquire and express neo continue to grow in the presence of G418. In the course of the selection, neo DNA becomes associated with high molecular weight cellular DNA and is retained even when cells are grown in the absence of G418 for extended periods. Since neo provides a marker for dominant selections, cell transformation to G418 resistance is an efficient means for cotransformation of nonselected genes.

3040769|a|We have isolated a mutant line of mouse L cells, termed gro29, in which the growth of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is defective. The block occurs late in the infectious cycle of both viruses. We demonstrate that HSV and VSV enter gro29 cells normally, negotiate the early stages of infection, yet are impaired at a late stage of virus maturation. During VSV infection of the mutant cell line, intracellular transport of its glycoprotein (G protein) is slowed. Pulse-chase experiments showed that oligosaccharide processing is impeded, and immunofluorescence localization revealed an accumulation of G protein in a juxtanuclear region that contains the Golgi complex. We conclude that export of newly made glycoproteins is defective in gro29 cells, and speculate that this defect may reflect a lesion in the glycoprotein transport apparatus.

2997997|a|The effect of tunicamycin and monensin on the biosynthesis, intracellular transport, and maturation of bovine herpesvirus type-1 (BHV-1) glycoproteins was examined. Tunicamycin completely inhibited the production of infectious virus particles and significantly reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into viral glycoproteins. In the presence of monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced, which was mainly due to inhibition of virus release, rather than virus production. Monensin only slightly inhibited viral glycoprotein synthesis. The effects of these compounds on infectivity indicated that glycosylation is required for the production of infectious virus, though complete processing of the glycoproteins is not essential. In addition, egress of the virions from infected cells probably requires a functional Golgi complex. In the presence of tunicamycin or monensin various degrees of glycosylation of the major glycoproteins occurred, consequently their rates of migration differed from that of the normal glycoproteins. Tunicamycin completely blocked glycosylation of GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7. In contrast, GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b were partially glycosylated in the presence of tunicamycin. These results indicated that GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7 are N-linked glycoproteins, but GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b contain both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all viral glycoproteins to the cell surface, suggesting that glycosylation is required for this process. In the presence of monensin, the viral glycoproteins were transported and expressed on the cell surface indicating that transport does not require complete processing of the glycoproteins and may occur via a Golgi-independent pathway. In addition, monensin-treated BHV-1 infected cells could act as target cells in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity assay. Thus, complete glycosylation may not be essential for maintenance of antigenicity and participation in immune destruction.

2414916|a|Glycoproteins GVP 3/9 and GVP 6/11a/16, two of the major glycosylated proteins specified by bovine herpesvirus type-1 (BHV-1), were purified on immunoadsorbents consisting of the appropriate monoclonal antibodies linked to Affigel-10. Each glycoprotein, whether purified from virus-infected cells or from virus, retained antigenic activity and induced high titers of monospecific antibodies in rabbits. These antibodies could neutralize virus and mediate complement-dependent lysis of virus-infected cells. Denatured glycoproteins GVP 3, GVP 6, GVP 11a, and GVP 16, which were purified by immunoadsorbent chromatography, followed by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, also retained antigenicity and immunogenicity, though to a lesser extent than the native glycoproteins. Antibodies induced by GVP 9, GVP 6, and GVP 11a could also neutralize and mediate immune lysis. Even though GVP 16 induced high levels of antibody, these antibodies could not neutralize virus or participate in antibody and complement-mediated cytolysis. These results may suggest that the orientation of GVP 6/11a/16 in the membrane is such that GVP 11a is better exposed on the virion envelope and the cell surface than GVP 16. Cross-reactivity between monospecific antibodies against GVP 3 and GVP 9, as well as GVP 6, GVP 11a, and GVP 16 supported the previously proposed hypothesis that GVP 3 (180K) is a dimer of GVP 9 (91K) and that GVP 6 exists in two forms: one being a 130K polypeptide and the other composed of GVP 11a (74K) and GVP 16 (55K) linked by disulfide bonds. These data suggest that, thus far, either GVP 6/11a/16 or GVP 3/9 may be a potential candidate for a subunit vaccine against BHV-1 infection.

3009533|a|The polypeptide specificities and defense mechanisms of the humoral immune response to bovine herpesvirus 1 were analyzed. Sequential serum samples taken from cows which were experimentally infected with bovine herpesvirus 1 were tested for their reactivity with individual bovine herpesvirus 1 polypeptides by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All bovine immune sera reacted with each of the three major bovine herpesvirus 1 glycoproteins, GVP 6/11a/16, GVP 3/9, and GVP 11b, during primary as well as recurrent infection. Among these glycoproteins, GVP 6/11a/16 induced the earliest and most consistent immune response. The levels of antibody to GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b varied among the animals, and they were slightly lower than the level of antibody to GVP 6/11a/16. Antibodies to several nonglycosylated polypeptides and two additional glycoproteins were also detected with the immunoblot assay. However, these antibodies were usually apparent only during recurrent infection, whereas they were undetectable or low during primary infection. The antibodies in the sera from all animals mediated virus neutralization and destruction of virus-infected cells by two immune mechanisms, e.g., antibody- and complement-mediated lysis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

2426466|a|Four unique glycoproteins or glycoprotein complexes were recognized by a panel of monoclonal antibodies to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), i.e., GVP 6/11a/16 (130,000-molecular-weight glycoprotein [130K glycoprotein]/74K/55K), GVP 7 (108K), GVP 3/9 (180K/91K), and GVP 11b (71K). The absence of any antigenic or structural relationship between GVP 11a and GVP 11b, which were previously identified as one glycoprotein, GVP 11, demonstrated that these two GVP 11 species are unique glycoproteins. GVP 3 and GVP 9 showed complete sequence homology, as shown by the identity of their antigenic determinants and by partial peptide mapping. This observation, as well as the ratio of their apparent molecular weights, indicated that GVP 3 (180K) is a dimeric form of GVP 9 (91K). GVP 6 and GVP 11a, as well as GVP 6 and GVP 16, showed at least partial sequence homology, since they shared several antigenic determinants and peptides. In addition, GVP 6, GVP 11a, and GVP 16 were derived from one primary precursor. These results, as well as the ratio of their apparent molecular weights, indicated that the GVP 6/11a/16 complex consists of two forms: one in which GVP 6 (130K) is uncleaved and the other one in which GVP 6 is cleaved and composed of GVP 11a (74K) and GVP 16 (55K), linked by disulfide bridges. An antigenically distinct precursor to each of the four BHV-1 glycoproteins or glycoprotein complexes was identified by monoclonal antibodies. These precursors, pGVP 6 (117K), pGVP 11a (62K), pGVP 7 (100K), pGVP 9 (69K), and pGVP 11b (63K) were sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment, indicating that they represent the partially glycosylated high-mannose-type intermediate forms generated by cotranslational glycosylation of the primary, unglycosylated precursors to GVP 6/11a/16, GVP 7, GVP 3/9, and GVP 11b, which were identified as having apparent molecular weights of 105,000, 90,000, 61,000, and 58,000, respectively. A new nomenclature for the BHV-1 glycoproteins, based on roman numerals, is proposed.

2414917|a|Monoclonal antibodies, specific for two of the major bovine herpesvirus type-1 (BHV-1) glycoproteins, GVP 3/9 and GVP 6/11a/16, have been previously produced and characterized. The reactivity of each monoclonal antibody was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the ability to neutralize viral infectivity, and the capacity to mediate complement-dependent (AbC') lysis of virus-infected cells. The topography of epitopes on GVP 3/9 and GVP 6/11a/16 was analyzed, using selected monoclonal antibodies in a competitive antibody binding assay (CBA). Nine epitopes were identified on GVP 3/9. Comparison of the biological activities and epitope specificities of the monoclonal antibodies against GVP 3/9 showed that one epitope was involved in virus neutralization, whereas six epitopes mediated AbC' lysis of the virus-infected cell. Of the seven epitopes identified on GVP 6/11a/16, six were involved in neutralization and three participated in AbC' lysis. In some cases, partial competition between monoclonal antibodies was observed, indicating that they were directed against overlapping or closely adjacent epitopes. In other instances, asymmetrical competition between monoclonal antibodies suggested conformational changes in the glycoprotein molecule induced by antibody binding. Mixtures of two monoclonal antibodies with different epitope specificities resulted in higher neutralizing activity than either antibody alone, suggesting that multiple monoclonal antibodies can exert a synergistic effect on virus neutralization.

6377683|a|Hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies to bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV-1) were established. The monoclonal antibodies were characterized with respect to their antigen specificities and biological activities. One group of eight monoclonal antibodies precipitated the glycoproteins GVP 3 (180K) and GVP 9 (91K), a second group of thirteen monoclonal antibodies precipitated GVP 6 (130K), GVP 11 (74K) and GVP 16 (55K), and one monoclone secreted antibodies specific for GVP 7 (105K). Analysis of the immune precipitates by electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions suggested that GVP 3 is a dimer of GVP 9. It also indicated that GVP 11 and GVP 16 are components of a disulfide-linked complex, GVP 6. The results, obtained by immunoprecipitation were confirmed by Western blot analysis and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using electrophoretically separated viral glycoproteins. In addition, these techniques demonstrated differential reactivities of the monoclonal antibodies with GVP 11 and GVP 16. The monoclonal antibodies were used to analyze the biological roles of these three sets of glycoproteins. Monoclonal antibodies directed against GVP 3/GVP 9 did not neutralize viral infectivity, but most of them mediated complement-dependent lysis of the infected cell. Individual monoclonal antibodies directed against GVP 6/GVP 11/GVP 16 could neutralize virus as well as participate in complement-mediated lysis. The only available monoclone against GVP 7 did not show any biological activity in the above two assays. Thus, GVP 6/GVP 11/GVP 16 may contain the attachment site of the virion.

Host cell and recombinant vector systems were defined which enabled the isolation of rodent or primate cell clones which expressed gp350/220 in substantial quantities. Continued expression of gp350/220 required maintenance of cells under positive selection for linked markers and periodic cloning. gp350/220 expressed in various host cells varied slightly in electrophoretic mobility, probably reflecting differences in glycosylation. Insertion of a stop codon into the gp350/220 open reading frame, upstream of the putative membrane anchor sequence, resulted in efficient secretion of truncated gp350 and gp220 from rat pituitary (GH3) cells. gp350/220 expressed in mammalian cells is highly immunogenic and elicits virus-neutralizing antibodies when administered to mice.

The transformation frequency observed was between 1 and 10 colonies per 10(6) cells per 20 microgram of donor DNA. Transformants displayed enzymatic activity that was donor derived as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing of cytoplasmic extracts.

6091142|a|Herpes simplex virus is most probably maintained in the ganglion neurons of the peripheral nervous system of humans in a latent form that can reactivate to produce recurrent disease. As an approximation of this cell-virus interaction, we have constructed a herpes simplex virus latency in vitro model system using human fetus sensory neurons as the host cell. Human fetus neurons were characterized as neuronal in origin by the detection of the neuropeptide substance P and the neuron-specific plasma membrane A2B5 antigen. Virus latency was established by blocking complete expression of the virus genome by treatment of infected human neurons with a combination of human leukocyte interferon and (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine for 7 days. After removal of inhibitors, virus latency was maintained for at least 9 days. This in vitro model will provide a system to analyze, in a primary human neuron, the state of the herpes simplex virus genome during establishment and maintenance of experimental latency.

6262523|a|We have previously described an in vitro system in which the function lacking for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) replication can be induced by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The mechanism of this reactivation of quiescent HSV-2 by HCMV has been further defined. The HCMV function(s) responsible for HSV-2 stimulation was examined temporally, and the fraction of cells in quiescent cultures producing HSV-2 after superinfection was determined. Using independent biological, genetic and molecular techniques we have made the following observations. (i) As early as 12 h after HCMV superinfection, HSV-2 RNA was expressed in latently infected cells. (ii) At 24 h after HCMV superinfection, a time when newly synthesized HCMV was not yet apparent, infectious HSV-2 was produced by reactivated cultures. (iii) Four HCMV temperature-sensitive mutants, which are DNA-negative at nonpermissive temperature and represent four different complementation groups, induced reactivation of HSV-2 at 39.5 degrees C. (iv) Early after HCMV superinfection, 1.6% of quiescent cells could be induced to transcribe HSV-2 information. (v) Early after HCMV superinfection, 0.3% of cells in the quiescent cultures could be induced to yield infectious HSV-2. The finding that a significant interaction can occur between HCMV and quiescent HSV-2 in an in vitro model is noteworthy in light of the knowledge that both of these herpesviruses often reside simultaneously in the human host.

6301144|a|We have estimated by the Northern blotting technique the size and genome location of major viral RNA transcripts found in the same cell line when the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome was latent, and 48 hr after it was induced to replicate by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA). A cellular subclone of the P3J-HR-1 line designated GG68-13 made these studies possible. Less than 1% of GG68-13 cells spontaneously synthesize viral antigens, whereas more than 80% of the cells enter the viral replicative cycle after exposure to TPA. In the absence of TPA six clearly resolved mRNA's, derived from scattered regions of the genome, are seen and at least four poorly resolved mRNA's map to BamHI fragment W, the internal repeat. Following treatment with the drug, 54 mRNA's have been identified, 28 of which are prominent. The mRNA's identified during latency are also synthesized, but in greater amounts, during viral replication. However, EBV-encoded small RNA's seem to be more abundant during latency than during viral synthesis.

6294333|a|The P3J-HR-1 strain of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) fails to immortalize human lymphocytes. We wished to understand the nature of the genomic alterations which correlated with the loss of this ability. As a first step, the heterogeneity of DNA molecules in the P3J-HR-1 line was eliminated by cell cloning. Then a physical map was prepared of virion DNA from one cell clone, designated FF452-3. By comparison with the genomes of two EBVs, B95-8 and FF41, which are competent to immortalize lymphocytes, we identified a total of eight modifications of BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease fragments of EBV (FF452-3) DNA consisting of insertions, deletions, or loss of a restriction endonuclease recognition site. To determine which of these alterations might be responsible for the loss of transforming phenotype, we examined homologous DNA fragments of the Jijoye strain of EBV, the progenitor of the HR-1 strain which still retains the ability to immortalize lymphocytes. We also studied viral DNA in lymphocytes transformed in vitro by Jijoye virus. Six of the eight alterations were found both in Jijoye and in clonal HR-1 DNA and were presumably genomic traits characteristic of this lineage of EBV. A small deletion in the BamHI-K fragment of HR-1 DNA was not found in Jijoye virion DNA, but this deletion was present in intracellular Jijoye DNA. Thus only one major genomic lesion in HR-1 DNA, a deletion of at least 2.4 x 10(6) molecular weight of DNA from a fused BamHI-H-Y fragment, consistently distinguished Jijoye DNA from its non-immortalizing P3J-HR-1 derivative. This deletion is likely to affect EBV genes which are directly or indirectly involved in immortalizing lymphocytes.

6302703|a|Early antigens (EAs) are made when the P3J-HR-1 strain of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects cells that already harbor latent EB viral genomes. We wished to identify EBV genes that might participate in induction of EAs. We have recently isolated from the HR-1 line EB viral variants that are unable to induce EAs. We have now isolated a clone of HR-1 cells that releases virus with the capacity to induce EA. We compared the genome of the EB variant that possesses the capacity to induce EA with that of a variant that is unable to induce EA and with parental stock that was the source of both different biotypes of EBV. The variant that is able to induce EA contains, in molar or greater quantities, additional fragments of EBV DNA not found in the variant that lacks that capacity. These same DNA fragments are present in submolar quantities in the parental DNA, indicating that they represent a subpopulation in the parental viral DNA mixture. We thus provide evidence that EA induction is brought about by unusual forms of EBV DNA that are likely to act by regulating expression of the genome.

6321789|a|By cloning the HR-1 Burkitt lymphoma line, we previously uncovered two distinct biological variants of nontransforming Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The most commonly cloned variant has a low rate of spontaneous viral synthesis and is unable to induce early antigen in Raji cells (EAI-). A rare variant spontaneously releases virus which is capable of inducing early antigen in Raji cells (EAI+). Since EAI- virus lacks heterogeneous DNA (het-) and EAI+ virus contains heterogeneous DNA (het+), we suggested that spontaneous viral synthesis and induction of early antigen are biological properties which correlate with the presence of het sequences. The present experiments provide three new lines of experimental evidence in favor of this hypothesis. (i) Revertant subclones of the EAI+ het+ variant which have lost the het DNA concomitantly lost EAI ability. Thus, het DNA is not stably associated with the cells as are the episomes. (ii) het DNA was acquired by two het- subclones of the HR-1 line after superinfection with EAI+ virus. After superinfection, these clones synthesized EAI+ het+ virus. Thus, het DNA may be maintained in the HR-1 line by cell-to-cell spread. (iii) Virus with het DNA activated full expression of endogenous latent EBV of the transforming phenotype in a line of immortalized neonatal lymphocytes designated X50-7. By use of restriction endonuclease polymorphisms unique to both the superinfecting and endogenous genomes, we show that the genome of the activated virus resembles that of the virus which was endogenous to X50-7 cells. This result suggests that het sequences result in transactivation of the latent EBV. het DNA had homology with EBV sequences which are not normally contiguous on the physical map of the genome. het DNA was always accompanied by the presence of DNA of nonheterogenous HR-1. Thus, het DNA is a form of "defective" EBV DNA. However, the biological effect of this defective DNA is to enhance rather than to interfere with EBV replication. This is a novel property of defective virus.

6328039|a|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), isolated from P3HR-1 cells, induces early antigen and viral capsid antigen upon infection of human B-lymphoblasts. The strong early antigen- and viral capsid antigen-inducing activity is only observed in P3HR-1 virus preparations harboring particles with defective genomes, suggesting that this biological activity is directly associated with the defective DNA population. After infection of EBV genome-carrying Raji or EBV genome-negative BJAB cells, defective genomes of P3HR-1 EBV DNA are replicated in excess, depending on the multiplicity of infecting EBV particles. Hybridization of the DNA from such infected cells with 32P-labeled EBV DNA after HindIII cleavage reveals six hypermolar fragments. Mapping of these fragments shows that they form one defective genome unit containing four nonadjacent regions (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) of the nondefective P3HR-1 EBV DNA. Two of the segments (alpha and beta) contain ca. 17 and 13 megadaltons, respectively, from the terminal regions of the P3HR-1 genome, whereas the two smaller segments (gamma and delta) contain ca. 3.7 and 3.0 megadaltons, respectively, originating from the central portion of the genome. In the defective molecule, the regions gamma and delta are present in the opposite orientation compared with nondefective P3HR-1 EBV DNA. Tandem concatemers are formed by fusion of the alpha and beta regions. Our model suggests that tandem concatemers of three defective genome units can be packaged into virions in P3HR-1 cells.

6286831|a|A bacterial gene (neo) conferring resistance to neomycin-kanamycin antibiotics has been inserted into SV40 hybrid plasmid vectors and introduced into cultured mammalian cells by DNA transfusion. Whereas normal cells are killed by the antibiotic G418, those that acquire and express neo continue to grow in the presence of G418. In the course of the selection, neo DNA becomes associated with high molecular weight cellular DNA and is retained even when cells are grown in the absence of G418 for extended periods. Since neo provides a marker for dominant selections, cell transformation to G418 resistance is an efficient means for cotransformation of nonselected genes.

Because COS cells produce SV40 T antigen and are permissive for SV40 viral replication, transfected SV-ORI plasmids replicate to a high copy number. SV-ORI plasmids carrying a human alpha-globin gene are also replicated in COS cells. Moreover, the alpha-globin gene is faithfully transcribed to produce high levels of RNA, which is accurately processed to produce authentic alpha-globin mRNA. We have used this transcription system to demonstrate that a sequence located between 55 and 87 base pairs upstream from the mRNA capping site is required for efficient transcription of the alpha-globin gene in COS cells.

The somatic cell hybrids were negative when examined for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) markers. When the hybrid cells were exposed to 5-iododeoxyuridine, both EBV-specific antigens and virus particles were induced as determined by the immunofluorescence test and by electron microscopy. The data presented suggest that the EBV genome can be transferred from a lymphoblastoid cell to another cell type during cell hybridization, that the EBV genome can persist in the hybrid cells for long periods of time, and that synthesis of the virus can be induced in the heterokaryons.

6300871|a|Transfection experiments using subgenomic fragments of the B95-8 strain of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA and EBV genome (HR-1)-positive epithelial/Burkitt hybrid cells (D98/HR-1) were carried out to determine whether an interaction between the transfecting virus fragment(s) and the endogenous HR-1 EBV genome could take place. Expression of EBV-specific antigens, including early antigen and virus capsid antigen, was examined in transfected cells by immunofluorescence. Attempts were also made to recover biologically active EBV from the D98/HR-1 cells after transfection with cloned fragments of B95-8 DNA. We found that D98/HR-1 cells transfected with the BamHI H or H, F, and X fragments were positive for early antigen 3 days after transfection. Spent media from transfected D98/HR-1 cells maintained for 20-30 days in culture were pooled, filtered, concentrated, and used as a potential source of virus to inoculate human umbilical cord blood lymphocytes. No evidence of transformation was observed with such preparations. However, if spent medium from D98/HR-1 cell cultures was first treated with iododeoxyuridine (to induce EBV DNA synthesis and replicative cycle) and then transfected with the BamHI H, F, and X fragments of B95-8 DNA and used to infect cord blood lymphocytes, transformation was obtained. A lymphoblastoid cell line derived in this manner, designated HI-HFX, is an EBV nuclear antigen-positive nonproducer cell line. Similar results were obtained with preparations from iododeoxyuridine-treated D98/HR-1 cells transfected with the EB 26-36 fragment of B95-8 DNA cloned in a Charon 4A vector. The EB 26-36 fragment contains the BamHI H, F, and X regions.

6306272|a|Three monoclonal antibodies were produced against the Epstein-Barr virus-induced early antigen complex. These antibodies were shown to be specific for the early antigen complex by the fact that they only reacted with cells supporting a permissive or abortive Epstein-Barr virus infection and their synthesis was not affected by inhibitors of viral DNA synthesis. One monoclonal antibody, designated R3, was directed against a diffuse component of the early antigen complex since it reacted by immunofluorescence with cells fixed in acetone or methanol. The other two monoclonal antibodies, designated K8 and K9, reacted with a methanol-sensitive restricted component of this complex. The appearance of the R3 antigen in P3HR-1 superinfected Raji cells occurred approximately 4 h earlier than the antigen detected by K8. By both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radioimmunoelectrophoresis, it was determined that the R3 monoclonal antibody recognized two major polypeptides with molecular weights of approximately 50,000 to 52,000, whereas K8 and K9 precipitated a protein of approximately 85,000. The R3 monoclonal antibody also immunoprecipitated an in vitro primary translation product. It was, therefore, possible to map this product to the Epstein-Barr virus DNA BamH1 M fragment. These in vitro products were slightly smaller than the in vivo proteins, suggesting that these proteins probably undergo posttranslational modification during the virus replication cycle.

6248876|a|An antibody-secreting hybrid cell line was produced by fusion of mouse myeloma cells with splenocytes from mice immunized with virions of the B95-8 strain of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). The monoclonal IgG antibody was shown to have anti-EBV activity by the following criteria: (i) It reacted with the membranes and the cytoplasm of seven different EBV-producing lines, but with no nonproducing line. (ii) The individual cells identified by the murine antibody were shown to be the same cells identified by a human serum having anti-EBV activity. (iii) The antibody significantly reduced the infectivity of two independent strains of EBV (namely, P3HR1K and B95-8). The antigen being recognized was characterized by immunoprecipitations of radiolabeled EBV-producer cell lysates. A single glycoprotein with an estimated molecular weight of 250,000 was identified. It is concluded that neutralization of EBV can be achieved by an IgG-class monoclonal antibody directed against a single antigenic site on a 250,000-dalton glycoprotein, which is a constituent of the EBV virion.

6328012|a|In a previous study the BamHI-K fragment of Epstein-Barr virus DNA was shown to induce a nuclear antigen, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA), when cotransfected with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene into mouse LTK- cells. We have now inserted the BamHI-K fragment and a BamHI/HindIII subfragment, I1f , into shuttle vectors containing the origin of replication of simian virus 40. These plasmids have been introduced into COS-1, which are monkey kidney cells transformed by an origin-defective simian virus 40 genome. This expression system permitted rapid characterization of antigens, mRNAs, and proteins related to EBNA. The same-sized EBNA protein (approximately 78,000) was made after transfection with BamHI-K (5.2 kilobase pairs [kbp]) or the I1f subfragment (2.9 kbp). A deletion of about 600 bp occurred when the I1f fragment was propagated on the pSV2 plasmid in Escherichia coli. The deleted fragment gave rise to a smaller protein (approximately 52,000). These data provide evidence that EBNA is encoded by the 2.9-kbp I1f and is not an induced cellular protein. Nuclear antigen and polypeptide expression occurred equally well when the Epstein-Barr virus DNA was cloned on PSV2 -gpt or pSVOd . The latter plasmid lacks sequences allowing for efficient early gene transcription as well as splicing and polyadenylation signals which are present in pSV2 . Preliminary mapping of the EBNA gene transcripts demonstrated that two mRNAs (2.9 and 2.4 kilobases [kb]) are homologous to the I1f fragment. Taken together, the data suggest that the 2.9-kbp I1f fragment contains the structural gene for EBNA synthesis. COS-1 cells will thus provide a valuable system in which to analyze functional domains of the EBNA gene.

6294181|a|Sera from a patient with a chronic Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection contained unusually high anti-EBV antibody titers (1:2560 to 1:10,240 for EA(D) and 1:5,120 to 1:40,960 for VCA). One of these serum samples was shown by immunoprecipitation to recognize at least 11 EBV-specific proteins from virus producer cells labeled in vivo and 10 EBV-specific proteins from in vitro translations of producer cell mRNA. Six of the in vivo labeled proteins (135,000, 89,000, 50,000 to 55,000 doublet, 46,000, and 34,000 daltons) are "early" by their resistance to phosphonoacetic acid, and five (350,000, 220,000, 160,000, 140,000, and 85,000 daltons) are "late" membrane and capsid proteins. The EBV-specific proteins immunoprecipitated from in vitro translations had molecular masses of 150,000, 140,000, 115,000, 52,000, 50,000, 45,000, 34,000, 29,000, 17,000, and 15,000. Subcellular fractionation studies of cells labeled in vivo revealed that the 135,000-dalton protein and part of the 50,000 to 55,000 dalton protein doublet were found in both the nuclear and the cytoplasmic fractions, and thus are good candidates to be components of the EA(D) diffuse-type immunofluorescence observed with many EA-positive sera.

2983118|a|We present results of biological experiments which indicate that the subpopulation of Epstein-Barr virus strain P3HR-1 with heterogeneous (het) DNA consists of self-contained replicons which multiply alongside, but independently of, Epstein-Barr virus strain HR-1 containing standard DNA. When a population of HR-1 virions containing het DNA was introduced into X50-7 cells, the input heterogeneous DNA increased in abundance, as did the DNA of the endogenous virus of X50-7 cells. The input standard HR-1 viral DNA, however, was not amplified. When parental HR-1 cells or a cellular subclone containing het DNA were grown for several weeks in the presence of human serum with neutralizing antibody, the het DNA was lost from the culture; standard HR-1 DNA, however, was not affected by antiserum. Furthermore, virions containing het DNA could be serially propagated through cellular subclones of HR-1 cells which lack het DNA. After each serial passage, cells which acquired het DNA released virions with the ability to induce early antigens in Raji cells. These experiments define a novel in vitro life cycle of an Epstein-Barr virus variant which is maintained, not vertically by partitioning to daughter cells in cell division, but horizontally by cell-to-cell spread.

194056|a|The complexity and abundance of Epstein-Barr (EBV)-specific RNA in cell cultures restringently, abortively, and productively infected with EBV has been analyed by hybridization of the infected cell RNA with purified viral DNA. The data indicate the following. (i) Cultures containing productively infected cells contain viral RNA encoded by at least 45% of EBV DNA, and almost all of the species of viral RNA are present in the polyadenylated and polyribosomal RNA fractions. (ii) Restringently infected Namalwa and Raji cultures, which contain only intranuclear antigen, EBNA, and enhanced capacity for growth in vitro, contain EBV RNA encoded by at least 16 and 30% of the EBV DNA, respectively. The polyadenylated and polyribosomal RNA fractions of Raji and Namalwa cells are enriched for a class of EBV RNA encoded by approximately 5% of EBV DNA. The same EBV DNA sequences encode the polyadenylated and polyribosomal RNA of both Raji and Namalwa cells. (iii) After superinfection of Raji cultures with EBV (HR-1), the abortively infected cells contain RNA encoded by at least 41% of EBV DNA. The polyadenylated RNA of superinfected Raji cells is enriched for a class of EBV RNA encoded by approximately 20% of EBV HR-1 DNA. Summation hybridization experiments suggest that the polyadenylated RNA in superinfected Raji cells is encoded by the same DNA sequences as encode RNA present in Raji cells before superinfection, most of which is not polyadenylated. That the same EBV RNA sequences are present in the polyadenylated and polyribosomal fractions of two independently derived, restringently infected cell lines suggests that these RNAs may specify functions related to maintenance of the transformed state. The complexity of this class of RNA is adequate to specify a sequence of a least 5,000 amino acids. That only some RNA species are polyadenylated in restringent and abortive infection suggests that polyadenylation or whatever determines polyadenylation may play a role in the restricted expression of the EVB genome.

6200936|a|Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or with signs or symptoms that frequently precede AIDS (pre-AIDS) were grown in vitro with added T-cell growth factor and assayed for the expression and release of human T-lymphotropic retroviruses (HTLV). Retroviruses belonging to the HTLV family and collectively designated HTLV-III were isolated from a total of 48 subjects including 18 of 21 patients wih pre-AIDS, three of four clinically normal mothers of juveniles with AIDS, 26 of 72 adult and juvenile patients with AIDS, and from one of 22 normal male homosexual subjects. No HTLV-III was detected in or isolated from 115 normal heterosexual subjects. The number of HTLV-III isolates reported here underestimates the true prevalence of the virus since many specimens were received in unsatisfactory condition. Other data show that serum samples from a high proportion of AIDS patients contain antibodies to HTLV-III. That these new isolates are members of the HTLV family but differ from the previous isolates known as HTLV-I and HTLV-II is indicated by their morphological, biological, and immunological characteristics. These results and those reported elsewhere in this issue suggest that HTLV-III may be the primary cause of AIDS.

2994217|a|The reported incidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) continues to increase in countries throughout the world. On the basis of a polynomial model for extrapolation, the cumulative number of cases diagnosed and reported since 1981 in the United States is expected to double during the next year with over 12,000 additional cases projected to be diagnosed by July 1986. The annual incidence rates for single (never-married) men in Manhattan and San Francisco, intravenous drug users in New York City and New Jersey, and persons with hemophilia A ranged from 261 to 350 per 100,000 population during 1984. For single men aged 25 to 44 years in Manhattan and San Francisco, AIDS was the leading cause of premature mortality in 1984 as measured by years of potential life lost. Infection with HTLV-III/LAV is considerably more common than reported AIDS in high-risk populations and can persist at least for several years, so the presence of specific antibody should be considered presumptive evidence of current infection. The screening of donated blood and plasma for antibody to HTLV-III/LAV and use of safer clotting factor concentrates should greatly reduce HTLV-III/LAV transmission through blood and blood products. Most HTLV-III/LAV infections occur through sexual transmission, use of contaminated needles, and as a result of infected mothers passing the virus to newborns. Continued research commitment is needed to develop an HTLV-III/LAV vaccine and therapy for this infection. In the interim, widespread community efforts are needed to minimize transmission.

2991896|a|Converging lines of research have linked human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) to the pathogenesis of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A characteristic feature of this virus is its genomic heterogeneity, which occurs to varying degrees in different viral isolates. To define further the nature and extent of these genomic changes, we compared the molecularly cloned genomes of two variant HTLV-III isolates by extensive restriction enzyme mapping and heteroduplex thermal melt analysis. Both viral isolates were found to be highly related to each other throughout their entire genomic complement, yet they differed markedly in their restriction enzyme maps. Electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis revealed several distinct regions of divergence located almost exclusively in the part of the genome that encodes the viral envelope gene. In vitro culture of one of these viruses over a period of 3 months did not result in any genomic changes as determined by restriction analysis of viral DNA. These results, as well as the recently published nucleotide sequences of other HTLV-III isolates, indicate that the most substantial variation among HTLV-III isolates is located in the envelope. These findings raise the possibility that viral isolates from different individuals could have important biological differences in their envelope antigens, a consideration relevant to ongoing attempts to develop a vaccine against HTLV-III.

Inhibition of virus production resulted. The inference emerges that the tridecamer and its counterpart with blocked 3'- and 5'-hydroxyl termini enter the chick fibroblast cells, hybridize with the terminal reiterated sequences at the 3' and 5' ends of the 35S RNA, and interfere with one or more steps involved in viral production and cell transformation. Likely sites of action are (i) the circularization step of the proviral DNA intermediate, and (ii) the initiation of translation, the latter being described in the following communication [Stephenson, M. L. & Zamecnik, P. C. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, 285--288].

The inhibition specificity for oncornavirus RNA is greater than for rabbit reticulocyte mRNA or brome mosaic virus RNA. Other oligodeoxynucleotides of similar size have little or no specific effect on the RNA-directed translation. The tridecamer acts as a primer for the avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase when Rous sarcoma virus heated 70S RNA is used as a template, offering evidence that it can hybridize to the RNA. The possible use of such an oligodeoxynucleotide hybridization competitor to inhibit Rous sarcoma virus replication is described in the preceding paper [Zamecnik, P. C. & Stephenson, M. L. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 75, 280--284].

3010316|a|Selective inhibition of regulatory immediate early (IE) genes of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) should inhibit virus growth. Treatment of HSV-1-infected cells with the oligo(nucleoside methylphosphonate) d(TpCCTCCTG) (deoxynucleoside methylphosphonate residues in italic), which is complementary to the acceptor splice junction of HSV-1 IE pre-mRNA 4 and 5, before (1-24 hr) or at the time of infection caused a dose-dependent inhibition in virus replication. Virus titers were decreased 50% and 90% in cells treated with 25 microM and 75 microM oligomer, respectively; at 300 microM, a 99% reduction in virus production was observed. Viral DNA synthesis was reduced 70-75% and there was a 90% reduction in synthesis of viral proteins, including other IE species and viral functional (130-kDa major DNA-binding) and structural (glycoprotein gB) proteins. In the same concentration range, d(TpCCTCCTG) caused a minimal reduction (0-30%) in protein synthesis and growth rates (less than 40%) of uninfected cells. The data suggest that oligo(nucleoside methylphosphonate)s may be effective in antiviral chemotherapy.

6438637|a|A plasmid was constructed to generate RNA complementary to the beta-galactosidase mRNA under control of the phage lambda PL promoter. When this anti-mRNA was produced, synthesis of beta-galactosidase was dramatically inhibited (98%). Syntheses of galactoside permease and transacetylase, whose coding sequences are downstream of the beta-galactosidase coding region, are inhibited to a lesser degree, 80% and 55%, respectively. The generation of anti-mRNA that can be targeted to inhibit a single species of mRNA molecule within cells provides a potent mechanism by which specific transcripts can be translationally inactivated. This can be used to determine the function of proteins as well as to select cloned genes in a single rapid and convenient step.

6323013|a|As an alternative approach to classical genetic analysis, we are investigating the potential of anti-sense (nonsense) DNA strand transcription to inhibit gene activity. A promoter will direct transcription of the complementary nonsense DNA strand when the protein coding sequence of a cloned gene is excised and then reinserted in reverse orientation. When such flipped gene constructions of the HSV thymidine kinase (TK) gene are coinjected with the wild-type gene at a 100:1 ratio, there is a reduction of transient TK expression in TK- mouse L cells. The proportion of viable cells with demonstrable TK activity drops 4-fold as compared with neighboring cells coinjected with TK and an excess of control plasmid. Furthermore, autoradiography of the cells still expressing TK shows that 3H-thymidine incorporation is reduced. Cells contransformed with flipped TK gene constructions have a reduced capacity to express subsequently microinjected TK genes, suggesting that the anti-message phenomenon is due to a trans-inhibition of TK and is probably not an artifact of rearrangements following microinjection.

10793670|a|Several electrophoretic and chromatographic systems have been investigated and compared for sequence analysis of oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Three systems were found to be useful for the separation of a series of sequential degradation products resulting from a labeled oligonucleotide: (I) 2-D electrophoresisdagger; (II) 2-D PEI-cellulose; and (III) 2-D homochromatography. System (III) proved generally most informative regardless of base composition and sequence. Furthermore, only in this system will the omission of an oligonucleotide in a series of oligonucleotides be self-evident from the two-dimensional map. The sequence of up to fifteen nucleotides can be determined solely by the characteristic mobility shifts of its sequential degradation products distributed on the two-dimensional map. With this method, ten nucleotides from the double-stranded region adjacent to the left-hand 3'-terminus and seven from the right-hand 3'-terminus of bacteriophage lambda DNA have been sequenced. Similarly, nine nucleotides from the double-stranded region adjacent to the left-hand 3'-terminus and five nucleotides from the right-hand terminus of bacteriophage phi80 DNA have also been sequenced. The advantages and disadvantages of each separation system with respect to sequence analysis are discussed.

6438633|a|We have developed a general method for introducing cloned genes into mammalian cells that affords substantial benefits over current technology. It is simple, rapid, and applicable to many (perhaps all) cell types, including those that are refractory to traditional transfection procedures. The method involves exposure of a suspension of cells and cloned DNA to a high-voltage electric discharge. In a model application of this transfection procedure, we have studied the expression of cloned human and mouse Ig kappa genes stably introduced into mouse pre-B cells and fibroblasts. We find that there is a B-cell-specific enhancer-activator region in the J-C intron of the human kappa gene that is necessary for efficient transcription of the cloned gene in mouse pre-B lymphocytes. This suggests that both the DNA element and the proteins required for its regulatory activity have been highly conserved in evolution and that these elements operate at the pre-B-cell stage of immunocyte development, a stage that precedes productive kappa gene rearrangement.

The two viruses show slightly different specificities toward the four homoribopolymers. Polydeoxyribonucleotides are generally much poorer templates than the homologous polyribonucleotides, in most cases yielding no detectable synthesis. The DNA polymerase of RNA tumor viruses, therefore, have the same requirements for activity as do other DNA polymerases, except that they prefer polyribonucleotides over polydeoxyribonucleotides as templates.

3006077|a|Human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III)/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) is a a newly discovered lymphotropic retrovirus that is cytopathic for helper/inducer T cells in vitro. This virus is the etiologic agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and related diseases. In the current study, we tested the capacity of purine and pyrimidine nucleoside derivatives to inhibit the infectivity and cytopathic effect of human T-lymphotropic virus type III in vitro. With the ribose moiety of the molecule in a 2',3'-dideoxy configuration, every purine (adenosine, guanosine, and inosine) and pyrimidine (cytidine and thymidine) nucleoside tested suppressed the virus, although the thymidine derivative seemed to have substantially less activity in our system than the others. In general, we observed essentially complete suppression of the virus at doses that were lower by a factor of 10 to 20 than those needed to inhibit the proliferation of the target T cells and the immune reactivity of normal T cells in vitro. An analysis of five adenosine congeners, which differed only in the sugar moiety, revealed that reduction (an absence of hydroxyl determinants) at both the 2' and 3' carbons of the ribose was necessary for an anti-viral effect, and an additional reduction at the 5' carbon nullified the anti-viral activity. These observations may be of value in developing a new class of experimental drugs for the therapy of human T-lymphotropic virus type III infections.

Two full-length integrated proviral DNA forms of HTLV-III have now been cloned and analyzed, and DNA sequences of the virus in cell lines and fresh tissues from patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) have been characterized. The results revealed that (i) HTLV-III is an exogenous human retrovirus, approximately 10 kilobases in length, that lacks nucleic acid sequences derived from normal human DNA; (ii) HTLV-III, unlike HTLV types I and II, shows substantial diversity in its genomic restriction enzyme cleavage pattern; (iii) HTLV-III persists in substantial amounts in cells as unintegrated linear DNA, an uncommon property that has been linked to the cytopathic effects of certain animal retroviruses; and (iv) HTLV-III viral DNA can be detected in low levels in fresh (primary) lymphoid tissue of a minority of patients with AIDS or ARC but appears not to be present in Kaposi's sarcoma tissue. These findings have important implications concerning the biological properties of HTLV-III and the pathophysiology of AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma.

After extensive sero-epidemiological studies, together with numerous virus isolations from these patients, we concluded that HTLV-III is the causative agent of AIDS. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of two highly related but distinct forms of the HTLV-III genome. The viral genome is approximately 10 kilobases long and is detected in HTLV-III-infected cells but not in uninfected cells, including normal human tissue, indicating that this virus is exogenous to man. We also demonstrate distant nucleic acid sequence homology between the cloned genome of HTLV-III and those of HTLV-I and HTLV-II. The availability of the cloned HTLV-III genome will now allow an unambiguous comparison of this virus with other retroviruses that also have been associated with the pathogenesis of AIDS, and moreover, with facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic measures in the treatment of AIDS.

Mononuclear cell preparations were hybridized with a 35S-labeled HTLV-III-specific RNA probe and exposed to autoradiographic emulsion for 2 days. HTLV-III-infected cells expressing viral RNA were detected in approximately 86% (6/7) of lymph node and 50% (7/14) of peripheral blood samples studied. However, in all patient samples examined, labeled cells were observed at very low frequency (less than 0.01% of total mononuclear cells). The HTLV-III-infected cells exhibited morphological characteristics consistent with that of lymphocytes and expressed viral RNA at relatively low abundance (20-300 copies per cell). These results demonstrate that HTLV-III expression in lymph node and peripheral blood is very low in vivo. Furthermore, the lymph node hyperplasia observed in HTLV-III-associated lymphadenopathy is not directly due to proliferation of HTLV-III-infected lymphocytes.

By functional mapping of complementary DNA transcripts of viral messenger RNA's the major functional domain of the gene encoding this factor was localized to a region immediately before the env gene of the virus, a region previously thought to be noncoding. This newly identified gene consists of three exons, and its transcription into messenger RNA involves two splicing events bringing together sequences from the 5' part (287 base pairs), middle (268 base pairs), and 3'part (1258 base pairs) of the HTLV-III genome. A similar messenger RNA with a truncated second exon (70 base pairs) does not encode a trans-acting function. It is proposed that this second messenger RNA is the transcript of a gene (3'-orf) located after the env gene. Messenger RNA's were also identified for the env and gag-pol genes of HTLV-III.

The infected cultures were then examined by scanning electron microscopy.

Attempts to culture P. carinii indefinitely were not successful. However, cyst forms derived from murine and human sources increased 100-fold and 10-fold, respectively, during CEL cell culture passages. Serial passage of trophozoites alone resulted in the development of typical CPE and a maximum number of 2.8 X 10(3) cyst forms. Autoradiographic methods demonstrated active DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis within the cyst and suggest that metabolic interaction between the host cells and the organisms occurred. The nature of the attachment of P. carinii to the host CEL cell was clearly discernible by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the reproductive cycle a vegetative cell (designated "trophozoite") attached by tubular expansions to the hhed without entering the cell. Sporozoites developed within the detached young cyst, reaching a maximum number of eight within the mature cyst. Excystment occurred through single or multiple sites in the cyst wall, after which the released trophozoite attached to a new host cell.

7072794|a|A 50-year-old woman with progressive right-sided visual loss had severely reduced visual acuity in the right eye and an upper temporal visual field defect in the left eye. Extensive neuroradiologic studies disclosed an enlarged right optic nerve, and a transfrontal craniotomy. Biopsy of the right optic nerve showed perivascular lymphocytic infiltration and a few atypical astrocytes. A complete medical evaluation gave no evidence of systemic vasculitis or lymphoreticular malignancy. Oral corticosteroids were administered for two months, and no further deterioration of vision occurred. Two years later, although the right eye was blind, the visual acuity of the left eye was 6/2 (20/20), and the patient had no clinical or radiologic evidence of optic chiasm tumor.

988514|a|An interesting case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is presented in which the clinical onset of myelopathy strongly suggested demyelinating disease. Later, intracranial hypertension developed on two occasions. Postmortem examination showed the systemic lesions of SLE. In addition, demyelinating lesions were found in the spinal cord and the optic nerve, the neuropathologic picutre of Devic's syndrome, a variant of multiple sclerosis. We question whether some of the cases showing necrotic myelopathy might have an autoimmune pathogenesis.

The visual outcome varied, but improvement occasionally occurred following treatment with corticosteroids. The clinical picture was variable and could present as acute retrobulbar optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy, or slowly progressive visual loss. Visual evoked response testing revealed increased latency in two patients and loss of amplitude in two others; a fifth patient had both findings in the involved eye. Despite the variable presentation, the probable pathogenesis in all cases is vaso-occlusive disease in small vessels of the optic nerves.

In each case the fistula had remained patent for an extended period before occlusion (range, several months to 25 years). The argon laser offers several advantages over conventional surgical methods of reopening the fistula. The patients need not be hospitalized and require no sedation or anesthesia, the risk of damaging the lens is minimized, and the treatment can be safely repeated. This technique was not successful when the fistula was occluded by nonpigmented tissue.

7049132|a|Low levels of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were found by indirect immunofluorescence in the serum of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Antibodies were found in 22 (81%) of 27 patients with MS and four (20%) of 20 healthy control subjects, with human epithelial (HEp-2) cells as substrate. Antinuclear antibody titers ranged from 8 to 32 in patients with MS and rarely reached above 8 in control subjects. The most common fluorescence patterns produced by MS serums were diffuse, fine speckled, and diffuse with fine-speckled nuclear fluorescence. Large nucleolar speckles and cytoplasmic fine speckles were also seen. Similar, although stronger patterns were seen in control subjects with positive tests for systemic lupus erythematosus. No correlation was found between ANA and antimeasles antibody titers. The presence of a heterogeneous population of circulating antibodies to a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens lends further support to the concept that altered immune reactivity exists in MS.

Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-mitochondrial antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were not detected with increased frequency in the materials studied. Smooth-muscle antibody (SMA) was, however, detected in CSF and serum from three patients with MS and one patient with chronic lymphocytic meningoencephalitis, and in the CSF only from one additional patient with MS. The SMA activities of the CSF were 4 to 16 times higher than in the matching sera, suggesting a local SMA synthesis within the central nervous system. The SMA was associated with electrophoretically restricted fractions of IgG, but an association between SMA and oligoclonal IgG of the CSF could not be demonstrated in the SMA-positive patients by the methods used.

Thirty-five percent of the sera were positive by one or more of these tests; Raji-RIA had the highest sensitivity (29.4%). Incidence of CIC in acute relapse, progressive, remission, and stable state of MS was 33.3%, 30.2%, 26.1%, and 23.1%, respectively, by Raji-RIA, compared with 7.75% and 8.82% among normal and neurologic controls. The incidence of CIC in neurologic controls differed significantly from both acute relapse and progressive disease, and almost significantly from patients in remission. There was no significant difference between patients with stable MS and neurologic controls, and there was no association of CIC with HLA-B7.

Serial studies in two patients revealed that clinical improvement was accompanied by a decline in the serum levels of these factors. These findings suggest that measurement of these serum proteins may be of value in assessing progress of disease activity in MS patients.

769625|a|The administration of glucocorticosteroids results in a wide range of effects on inflammatory and immunologically mediated disease processes. Glucocorticosteroids cause neutrophilic leukocytosis together with eosinopenia, monocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia. A principal mechanism whereby corticosteroids suppress inflammation is their impeding the access of neutrophils and monocytes to an inflammatory site. Granulocyte function is relatively refractory, whereas monocyte-macrophage function seems to be particularly sensitive to corticosteroids. Corticosteroid administration causes a transient lymphocytopenia of all detectable lymphocyte subpopulations, particularly the recirculating thymus-derived lymphocyte. The mechanism of this lymphocytopenia is probably a redistribution of circulating cells to other body compartments. There is considerable disagreement about the direct effects of corticosteroid administration on human lymphocyte function. The corticosteroid regimen should be adjusted to attain maximal therapeutic benefit with minimal adverse side effects. Often, alternate-day dosage regimens effectively maintain disease remission with minimization or lack of Cushingoid and infectious complications.

3605161|a|A long-term retrospective case-control study was performed comparing 119 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with cyclophosphamide and 119 matched control patients with rheumatoid arthritis not treated with cyclophosphamide to determine the risk of subsequent malignancy. Thirty-seven malignancies were detected in 29 cyclophosphamide-treated patients, while 16 malignancies were found in 16 control patients (p less than 0.05) during a mean follow-up period of more than 11 years. Urinary bladder cancer (six cyclophosphamide-treated patients, no control patients) and skin cancer (eight cyclophosphamide-treated patients, no control patients) were identified as differing statistically between the groups, and hematologic malignancy (five cyclophosphamide-treated patients, one control patient) showed a similar trend. Survival analysis indicated that the rate of development of malignancy in the cyclophosphamide-treated patients was significantly greater than in the control patients at six years following drug initiation, and that this increased rate persisted even at 13 years (p less than 0.01). Of the many risk factors evaluated, mean total cyclophosphamide dose and duration and tobacco use were significantly increased in patients in whom cancer subsequently developed. These long-term complications must be considered seriously when cyclophosphamide or other cytotoxic drugs are initiated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

6294517|a|Fifty-eight patients with severe, progressive multiple sclerosis were prospectively randomized to one of three treatments: 20 received intravenous ACTH, 20 received high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide plus ACTH, and 18 were placed on a regimen consisting of plasma exchange, low-dose oral cyclophosphamide, and ACTH. The three groups were similar in age, sex, duration and type of disease, and degree of disability. Before treatment and six months and one year after treatment, a disability-status score, ambulation index, and functional-status score were determined, and a quantitative neurologic examination was performed. In the ACTH group, the number of patients stabilized or improved was 8 of 20 at six months and 4 of 20 at one year; in the cyclophosphamide-ACTH group, 18 of 20 at six months and 16 of 20 at one year; and in the plasma exchange group, 11 of 18 at six months and 9 of 18 at one year. High-dose cyclophosphamide plus ACTH was most effective in halting progression of the disease at both 6 and 12 months (at 12 months, cyclophosphamide-ACTH vs. ACTH, P = 0.0004; cyclophosphamide-ACTH vs. plasma exchange, P = 0.087). Thus, progressive multiple sclerosis may be stabilized by short-term, intensive immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide plus ACTH.

3511372|a|We evaluated renal function in 107 patients with active lupus nephritis who participated in long-term randomized therapeutic trials (median follow-up, seven years). For patients taking oral prednisone alone, the probability of renal failure began to increase substantially after five years of observation. Renal function was better preserved in patients who received various cytotoxic-drug therapies, but the difference was statistically significant only for intravenous cyclophosphamide plus low-dose prednisone as compared with high-dose prednisone alone (P = 0.027). The advantage of treatment with intravenous cyclophosphamide over oral prednisone alone was particularly apparent in the high-risk subgroup of patients who had chronic histologic changes on renal biopsy at study entry. Patients treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide have not experienced hemorrhagic cystitis, cancer, or a disproportionate number of major infections. We conclude that, as compared with high-dose oral prednisone alone, treatment of lupus glomerulonephritis with intravenous cyclophosphamide reduces the risk of end-stage renal failure with few serious complications.

In one center, five of 22 patients who had undergone CPD during a one-month period developed peritonitis caused by an M. chelonei-like organism acquired from a single contaminated automated CPD machine. In a second center, five of eight patients who had received CPD during a several-week period became infected, apparently as a result of cross-infection from contaminated machines. Seven sporadic cases of peritonitis due to an M. chelonei-like organism were also found. M. chelonei-like organisms can survive and proliferate in water and are relatively resistant to formaldehyde. Defects in the design of CPD machines and disinfection procedures were identified that may have permitted M. chelonei-like organisms to survive attempted disinfection.

3837506|a|Reuse of hemodialyzers has continued to increase dramatically. In 1983, 52% of the hemodialysis centers were reusing hemodialyzers. Use of hollow fiber hemodialyzers has paralleled this increase in hemodialyzer reuse with 63% of the hemodialysis centers reporting exclusive use of this type of hemodialyzer in 1983. Although reuse of hemodialyzers has not been associated with increased incidence of hepatitis B infection or pyrogenic reactions, an outbreak of nontuberculous mycobacteria in 27 chronic hemodialysis patients was probably associated with water used to reprocess dialyzers. Nontuberculous mycobacteria were isolated from the water in 83% of 115 hemodialysis centers surveyed across the United States and could constitute a potential infection risk because of the organisms' greater germicide resistance than most other naturally occurring water bacteria. Two percent formaldehyde is not an effective germicide for high level disinfection of hemodialyzers. Reprocessed hemodialyzers should be disinfected with 4% formaldehyde or an equivalent disinfectant.

4045242|a|Between April and November 1982, 27 of 140 patients in a hemodialysis center in Louisiana were infected with rapidly growing mycobacteria; 14 had bacteremia alone, 3 had soft-tissue infections, 1 had an access-graft infection, and 9 had widely disseminated disease. Of 26 identified isolates, 25 were Mycobacterium chelonei ssp. abscessus, and one was an M. chelonei-like organism. One factor common to all patients was exposure to processed hemodialyzers (artificial kidneys). Environmental sampling of the water-treatment system showed widespread contamination with nontuberculous mycobacteria, which were also recovered from the patient's side (blood compartment) of five of 31 hemodialyzers that had been processed and were ready for use. The formaldehyde concentration was less than 2% in two of three such contaminated dialyzers tested. We hypothesize that patients became infected when their blood circulated through processed dialyzers that contained viable rapidly growing mycobacteria. This outbreak demonstrates that hemodialysis patients may be at risk for developing infections with rapidly growing mycobacteria and that such infections may go unrecognized when routine culture methods are used. It also emphasizes the importance of using effective procedures to disinfect dialyzers in hemodialysis centers.

3891655|a|In summary, rapidly growing mycobacteria, M. fortuitum and M. chelonei, are pathogens of increasing importance which are often hospital-acquired and can infect patients with iatrogenic immunosuppression. They readily grow on routine mycobacterial culture media and must be distinguished from non-pathogenic rapidly growing species and slowly growing mycobacteria. Widely distributed in nature, they are often present in hospital environments, especially in water. Compared to M. tuberculosis they are weak pathogens, and infected patients are not considered contagious. Disease is probably acquired from environmental sources by direct entry of the organisms through traumatized skin or mucous membranes or by aspiration into previously abnormal lungs. They are usually resistant to antituberculous agents but are susceptible to several commonly used antibacterial agents. Treatment generally requires one or more active antibiotics plus adjunctive surgery in many cases. Prevention of nosocomial infection lies in proper disinfection of potentially contaminated medical devices and elimination of contaminated water.

The following factors were observed to affect the relative resistances of naturally occurring and subcultured cells of the P. aeruginosa strain: (i) temperature at which the cultures were incubated prior to exposure to disinfectants, (ii) growth phase of the cultures at the time of exposure to disinfectants, (iii) nature of the suspending menstruum for disinfectants, and (iv) exposure to fluorescent light during incubation of inocula prior to testing. The applied significance of these findings may alter the present concepts of disinfectant testing as well as routine control procedures in the hospital environment.

104656|a|With the increasing significance of group IV atypical mycobacteria as etiological agents in a variety of infections, studies were conducted to determine their growth capabilities in water and their comparative resistance to disinfectants used to decontaminate hospital equipment. Isolates of Mycobaterium chelonei (TM strains) from peritoneal fluids of patients and peritoneal dialysis machines were able to multiply in commercial distilled water, with generation times at 25 degrees C ranging from 8 to 15 h. Levels of 10(5) to 10(6) cells per ml were attained, and these stationary-phase populations declined only slightly over a 1-year period. Results of studies to determine resistance to disinfectants showed the following. (i) TM strains of M. chelonei cultured in commercial distilled water showed survivors in 2% aqueous formaldehyde (HCHO) solutions up to 24 h; in 8% HCHO, only a 2-log reduction in viable counts was observed over a 2-h sampling period. Reference ATCC strains of M. chelonei and M. fortuitum were rapidly inactivated, with no survivors after 2 h of exposure to 2% HCHO or 15 min of exposure to 8% HCHO. (ii) In 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde, TM strains survived 60 min. whereas ATCC strains showed no survivors after 2 min of contact time. (iii) All M. chelonei and M. fortuitum strains survived 60 min of exposure to concentrations of 0.3 and 0.7 microgram of free chlorine per ml at pH 7.

6348076|a|A group of 89 smear-positive sputum specimens were evaluated by radiometric and standard plate procedures to determine the methodology which would provide the earliest detection of mycobacteria and maximum test sensitivity. Digested non-decontaminated specimens were concentrated and inoculated into modified selective BACTEC radiometric 7H12 broth and Mitchison selective 7H10 agar. Sodium hydroxide (1.5% final concentration) was then used to decontaminate these specimens. They were then concentrated and inoculated into both selective and nonselective 7H12 radiometric broths and into selective 7H10 and nonselective Middlebrook 7H11 agar media. The specimen processing and media combinations providing the earliest detection were non-decontaminated specimens with modified selective 7H12 BACTEC broth and decontaminated specimens with 7H12 BACTEC broths. Maximum sensitivity (percent positive) was obtained by using non-decontaminated specimens on Mitchison selective 7H10 Agar (98%) or decontaminated specimens in 7H12 BACTEC broth (95%). The decontamination process was found to reduce significantly the number of mycobacteria in clinical specimens, particularly the mycobacteria other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The specimen processing-media combinations providing the earliest detection and maximum recovery of mycobacteria (100%) were non-decontaminated specimens with modified selective 7H12 BACTEC broth or Mitchison selective agar and decontaminated specimens with 7H12 BACTEC broth or 7H11 agar.

Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare-scrofulaceum (MAIS) were isolated from 25% of the water, samples, mostly those from South Carolina, Georgia, and the Gulf states. Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium marinum were not found, probably because of the detrimental effects of the NaOH used to decontaminate the samples. MAIS strains were found more often in estuaries than in fresh or ocean waters. The frequency of Mycobacterium intracellulare was relatively uniform along the entire coast, while Mycobacterium scrofulaceum predominated in the South. Only M. intracellulare was found in aerosol specimens, although both M. intracellulare and M. scrofulaceum were found in waters collected at the same sites.

In a survey which included both potable and natural water samples from many sites within the state of Texas, nine isolations of high-catalase strains of M. kansasii were obtained from 232 water samples tested. Acid-fast smear results were compared with mycobacterial isolations. An isolate from a river in central Texas is the first high-catalase strain of M. kansasii encountered in a natural water supply.

6780606|a|Media containing antimicrobial agents have been formulated for use as an adjunct to the standard media in an effort to reduce contamination and improve isolation of mycobacteria from clinical specimens. Selective 7H10 (S7H10) was developed for use in the isolation of mycobacteria from undecontaminated material. During a 33-month period, 10,782 clinical specimens were cultured in parallel on S7H10 without decontamination and on 7H11 after treatment with 2% sodium hydroxide-N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Results of this study show the overall contamination rate to be threefold lower on S7H10 than on 7H11 (304 versus 1,000). The number of specimens negative on NaOH-treated, 7H11-cultured specimens and contaminated on S7H10 was 282, whereas that negative on S7H10 but contaminated on NaOH-7H11 was 923. There were 6 positive cultures missed due to contamination on S7H10, compared with 61 on 7H11. Positive cultures on S7H10 outnumbered those on 7H11 by 106. This evaluation of S7H10 shows that it can be used with undecontaminated specimens in conjunction with standard methods and media for isolation of mycobacteria from clinical specimens.

All strains grew well enough in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth for endpoints to be read after 72 h of incubation. Some strains of M. chelonei did not grow on Mueller-Hinton agar. A few discrepancies were noted between the broth and agar procedures. For M. fortuitum, doxycycline, minocycline, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were the most active agents. For M. chelonei, amikacin, sisomicin, tobramycin, and erythromycin were the most active agents. The M. chelonei-like organisms were most susceptible to ampicillin, doxycycline, minocycline, amikacin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Broth microdilution appears to be a reliable method for susceptibility testing of rapidly growing mycobacteria, although clinical studies are needed to determine how well in vitro results correlate with therapeutic in vivo outcome.

Functional transmission is also evident in vivo on the time scale of minutes after motor axons enter adjacent myotomes. The ability to release acetylcholine (ACh) may be induced in motor nerve terminals after they contact receptive target cells. Alternately, growth cones may be capable of releasing ACh before contact. To examine the development of ACh release we have used isolated patches of acetylcholine receptor(AChR)-rich membrane as sensitive detectors of ACh. We report here that the growth cones of embryonic chick ciliary ganglion neurones can release ACh, even when the cells are grown in the absence of target myotubes.

6312327|a|A nerve process grows by inserting new membrane material at its advancing tip, the growth cone. In embryonic cell culture and in embryos of Xenopus laevis, many growth cones establish functional synaptic transmission within minutes after contact with muscle cells. The rapidity of synapse formation suggests that the growth cone may have already acquired the appropriate neurotransmitter and the machinery for transmitter release before encountering the target cell. Here, we have used a patch of outside-out embryonic muscle membrane formed with gigaohm seal at the tip of a micropipette as an extracellular probe for the presence of channel-activating substances near the growth cones of the isolated Xenopus embryonic neurones in culture. We report that single-channel activity resembling that of muscle acetylcholine receptor channels was induced when the probe was positioned near the growth cones of 50% of the neurones, suggesting the spontaneous release of acetylcholine (ACh) from these growth cones. The release of material from growth cones may occur as a consequence of the incorporation of new membrane during neurite extension; it may also have a role in the interaction between the growth cone and its immediate environment.

69706|a|1. Myotomal muscle cells from embryos of Xenopus laevis were cultured as a monolayer either alone or together with neural tube cells from the same embryos. 2. Spontaneous twitching and contractions evoked by electrical stimulation of neural perikarya were observed only in nerve-contacted muscle cells, and could be abolished by curare or alpha-bungarotoxin. 3. Within 2 days in culture muscle cells not contacted by nerve developed one or more discrete patches of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors as revealed by staining with fluorescent conjugates of alpha-bungarotoxin. Similar patches were also seen when staining was carried out after paraformaldehyde fixation, suggesting that they were not induced by the dyetoxin conjugate. 4. Radioautography after labelling with [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin revealed patches with grain densities approximately twenty-five-old greater than over the remainder of the cell. 5. Fluorescent stain on innervated cells was restricted to the path of nerve-muscle contact and sometimes extended for greater lengths than the largest patches seen on non-contacted muscle cells. 6. Similar long bands of stain associated with nerve--muscle contacts were observed when cultures were grown in high concentrations of curare and carbachol which prevented spontaneous twitching. They were also seen in cultures in which the addition of neural tube cells was delayed for 2-3 days. 7. It is concluded that innervation caused receptors to accumulate at sites of nerve-muscle contact and that this process can operate independently of muscle activity.

6256772|a|The currents through single acetylcholine-activated channels were measured on membrane fragments that had been torn from rat muscle myotubes with patch pipettes. The membrane fragments were sealed into the pipette by using the "gigohm-seal" technique of Neher, which also permitted voltage clamp of the membrane via the patch electrode. Membrane patches were excited by sudden withdrawal of the electrode from the cell. Substitution of fluoride for chloride ions in the bathing solution could prevent or reverse the tendency for the membrane at the electrode tip to seal over into a closed vesicle. The single membrane layer at the electrode tip could remain functional for up to 30 min. The apparent single channel conductance was minimally affected by excision. The current-voltage relationships for the single channel currents show that the inside (i.e., cytoplasmic surface) of the membrane fragment was exposed to the bathing solution. In symmetric Na solutions the current-voltage curve was nearly linear and reversed at approximately 0 mV. In other bathing solutions from 40 to 500 mM NaF, the observed zero current potential was close to that predicted by the Nernst equation. We present evidence that internal Na interacts with the channel, causing both saturation of outward current and block of inward current. At + 100 mV the apparent dissociation constant for internal Na was 138 mM.

6270629|a|1. The extracellular patch clamp method, which first allowed the detection of single channel currents in biological membranes, has been further refined to enable higher current resolution, direct membrane patch potential control, and physical isolation of membrane patches. 2. A description of a convenient method for the fabrication of patch recording pipettes is given together with procedures followed to achieve giga-seals i.e. pipette-membrane seals with resistances of 10(9) - 10(11) omega. 3. The basic patch clamp recording circuit, and designs for improved frequency response are described along with the present limitations in recording the currents from single channels. 4. Procedures for preparation and recording from three representative cell types are given. Some properties of single acetylcholine-activated channels in muscle membrane are described to illustrate the improved current and time resolution achieved with giga-seals. 5. A description is given of the various ways that patches of membrane can be physically isolated from cells. This isolation enables the recording of single channel currents with well-defined solutions on both sides of the membrane. Two types of isolated cell-free patch configurations can be formed: an inside-out patch with its cytoplasmic membrane face exposed to the bath solution, and an outside-out patch with its extracellular membrane face exposed to the bath solution. 6. The application of the method for the recording of ionic currents and internal dialysis of small cells is considered. Single channel resolution can be achieved when recording from whole cells, if the cell diameter is small (less than 20 micrometer). 7. The wide range of cell types amenable to giga-seal formation is discussed.

6306473|a|Plasma membranes are dynamic structures of proteins and lipids. Protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions within the membrane are believed to have important roles in many membrane functions, including ion transport, enzyme activity and signal reception. The acetylcholine (ACh) receptor-channel complex in skeletal muscle membrane is one of the best known integral membrane proteins. Its ion transport function is accessible to direct measurement at the single-channel level by the use of the 'giga-seal' patch recording technique. Here we used an in situ electrophoresis technique to rearrange the topography of pre-existing ACh receptor-channels in the muscle membrane, and measured the single-channel kinetics of ACh-activated channels in two different molecular environments within the membrane: those in the diffusely distributed region and those in the ACh receptor clusters induced by the applied field. We found that the channel kinetics are significantly prolonged in the ACh receptor cluster compared with the non-clustered region of the same cell. This result strongly supports the notion that the function of a membrane ionic channel depends on the local molecular environment.

3462745|a|We have studied the electrical events during the initial phase of nerve-muscle contact in embryonic Xenopus culture. Using a G omega-seal, whole-cell recording method, we monitored the membrane current of a muscle cell continuously while it was manipulated into close proximity of the growth cone of a cocultured spinal neuron. We found a rapid appearance of pulsatile inward currents at the muscle cell after the neurite-muscle contact. These currents were abolished by d-tubocurarine and alpha-bungarotoxin but were unaffected by tetrodotoxin. Both the drug sensitivity and the time course of these currents are similar to that of the spontaneous miniature end-plate currents (MEPCs) resulting from spontaneous release of pulses of acetylcholine (AcCho) from the nerve terminal. Unlike the MEPCs at the mature neuromuscular synapse, these early MEPCs varied greatly in their amplitudes, and there was a gradual increase in the frequency of the MEPCs of larger amplitudes during the first 20 min after the contact. Independent measurement of AcCho concentration near the growth cone by an excised patch of AcCho-sensitive muscle membrane showed that very little AcCho is released from the isolated growth cone, and marked release can be triggered by the contact with a muscle cell or with the excised membrane itself. The induction of release is relatively specific: contact with a neuron or the tip of a clean glass pipette was capable of inducing only a transient release, while persistent release was induced by contacts made with muscle membrane. This contact-dependent AcCho release may be responsible for an early induction of muscle activity and serve as a signal for the establishment of synaptic contact.

6148408|a|We have determined the time of onset and examined some of the properties of neurotransmitter sensitivity in Xenopus spinal neurones developing in dissociated cell culture. These cells are initially insensitive, but acquire responses to several agonists over a period of 6 h. Nearly one-third of the neurones were depolarized by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or by both GABA and glycine; these cells were not affected by glutamate. The reversal potential of the ionophoretic GABA response is -35 mV. These neurones are likely to be Rohon-Beard neurones. Roughly two-thirds of the neurones were depolarized by glutamate and hyperpolarized by GABA and by glycine. The reversal potential of the ionophoretic GABA response is -58 mV. These neurones are likely to include motoneurones. A quantitative measure of the sensitivity to a given GABA dose was obtained at early and intermediate stages of development. The mean 'sensitivity index' (ionophoretic sensitivity/input resistance) for both classes of neurones in vitro was initially the same as that seen in Rohon-Beard neurones in vivo. This sensitivity index did not increase with time in culture to attain the value at intermediate stages in vivo. The development of chemosensitivity in Rohon-Beard-like neurones in these cultures resembles that of Rohon-Beard neurones in the spinal cord with respect to the time of onset of responses to GABA, the reversal potential, pharmacology and desensitization of these responses, and the spectrum of agonists to which they are sensitive. It differs in the absence of a developmental increase in sensitivity to GABA. The development of chemosensitivity in motoneurone-like neurones in these cultures parallels that of Rohon-Beard-like neurones, with respect to the time of onset and level of sensitivity, as well as susceptibility to pharmacological blockers. Several features of normal neurotransmitter sensitivity, like features of the action potential, differentiate in culture in the absence of normal cellular interactions.

4537943|a|1. End-plate currents have been studied in glycerol-treated frog sartorius nerve-muscle preparations with the voltage clamp technique.2. End-plate currents follow a simple exponential time course over most of their declining phase.3. The rate constant alpha that characterizes this exponential decay depends upon membrane potential V according to the relationship alpha (V) = Be(AV), with A = 0.00795 +/- 0.00043 (S.E.) mV(-1) and B = 1.67 +/- 0.04 (S.E.) msec(-1).4. Voltage sensitivity decreases (that is, A in the above equation becomes smaller) as the recording and current-passing electrodes are moved away from the end-plate region.5. The voltage sensitivity of alpha is decreased by decreasing the gain of the voltage clamp amplifier.6. Changing the end-plate current amplitude by curare treatment, by increased calcium ion concentration, and by facilitation and depression has essentially no effect on end-plate current time course.7. When membrane potential is changed step-wise during the decaying phase of the end-plate conductance change, currents begin to decline with a rate constant alpha appropriate to the new membrane potential in less than 0.2 msec.8. Treatment with prostigmine methylsulphate in concentrations up to 50 mug/ml. slows end-plate current decay but has little effect on voltage sensitivity. That is, B in the above equation is decreased by prostigmine treatment, but A is relatively unaffected.

6040160|a|1. When a nerve-muscle preparation is paralysed by tetrodotoxin, brief depolarizing pulses applied to a motor nerve ending cause packets of acetylcholine to be released and evoke end-plate potentials (e.p.p.s), provided calcium ions are present in the extracellular fluid.2. By ionophoretic discharge from a 1 M-CaCl(2) pipette, it is possible to produce a sudden increase in the local calcium concentration at the myoneural junction, at varying times before or after the depolarizing pulse.3. A brief application of calcium facilitates transmitter release if it occurs immediately before the depolarizing pulse. If the calcium pulse is applied a little later, during the period of the synaptic delay, it is ineffective.4. It is concluded that the utilization of external calcium ions at the neuromuscular junction is restricted to a brief period which barely outlasts the depolarization of the nerve ending, and which precedes the transmitter release itself.5. The suppressing effect of magnesium on transmitter release was studied by a similar method, with ionophoretic discharges from a 1 M-MgCl(2)-filled pipette. The results, though not quite as clear as with calcium, indicate that Mg pulses also are only effective if they precede the depolarizing pulses.

5498509|a|1. Depression of transmitter release produced by preceding conditioning stimulation was studied at the frog's neuromuscular junction.2. Depression occurred when transmitter release was restricted to a short length of nerve terminal, or when release was initiated by electrotonic depolarization of the terminals after action potentials were abolished by tetrodotoxin.3. Quantitative studies revealed a non-linear relationship between the estimated magnitude of ;zero-time' depression and the amount of transmitter released by conditioning stimulation.4. Two stimuli separated by 20-200 msec were given and the ratio of the end-plate potential amplitudes (V(2)/V(1)) was measured. This amplitude ratio increased during depression produced by stimuli preceding the test pair.5. These observations may be explained by assuming that depression is associated with a reduction in release probability as well as a depletion of transmitter available for release.

820855|a|1. End-plate potentials (e.p.p.s) were recorded from frog neuromuscular junctions under conditions of low quantal content to study the long-term effects of repeated synaptic activity on transmitter release. 2. The nerve terminal was presented with 30-100 successive conditioning-testing trials applied once every 7-10 min over a 4-16 hr perod. Each conditioning-testing trial consisted of a 200-600 impulse conditioning train followed by a series of testing impulses. The magnitudes and time constants of decay of augmentation and potentiation following each successive conditioning train were determined by measuring the e.p.p. amplitudes resulting from the testing impulses. 3. The magnitude of augmentation immediately following the conditioning trains increased an average of 3-4 times (range 1-20) with sucessive trials. 4. As the magnitude of augmentation increased with successive trials the decay of augmentation deviated from a simple exponential, decaying faster immediately after the conditioning train. This faster decay led to a 20% decrease with successive trials in estimates of the time constant obtained from the first 10 or 20 sec of the decay of augmentation. The deviation of the decay of augmentation from a simple exponential could be accounted for if augmentation is related to the 4th power of some substance which decays with a simple exponential time course. Some alternative explantations for the non-exponential decay of augmentation are also discussed. 5. The magnitude of potentiation increased or decreased about 25% with successive trials. 6. The time constant characterizing the decay of potentiation inceased an average of 1-5 times (range 0-8-5 times) with successive trials. 7. The increase in the magnitude of augmentation with successive trials was accompanied by a similar increase in the magnitude of the e.p.p. amplitudes during the conditioning trains, suggesting that augmentation develops during the conditioning train. In some preparatons augmentation appeared to be the major factor acting to increase e.p.p. amplitudes during the conditioning train, having a greater effect than facilitation or potentiation. 8. If a sufficiently large number of successive trials were applied, a depression of e.p.p. amplitudes developed during the conditioning trains and estimates of the magnitude of potentiation following the depressed conditioning trains were reduced...

6292914|a|The excellent visibility of cultured cells allows the early events during formation of the neuromuscular junction to be suitably studied. It has been shown in various culture systems that synaptic transmission occurs early after nerve-muscle contact. Early synaptic potentials are small in amplitude and slow in time course reflecting a low acetylcholine receptor density at the site of nerve contact. Acetylcholine receptors accumulate later at the contact region. We have examined initial synaptic transmission at the growth cone-muscle contact in Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures. The approaching growth cone was observed under a phase-contrast microscope while the membrane potential of its target muscle cell was continuously monitored by using an intracellular microelectrode. The innervating neuron was stimulated extracellularly at the cell body. No synaptic potential was evoked when the growth cone was contacting the muscle only at the tip of filopodia. However, as soon as the main portion of the growth cone contacted the muscle membrane, nerve-evoked synaptic potentials were detected after stimulation of the nerve. This immediate appearance of synaptic potentials raises the possibility that acetylcholine could be released at the growth cone even prior to contact with muscle cells. As the area of contact enlarged during the observation period the amplitude of end-plate potentials also increased. Spontaneous synaptic potentials (miniature end-plate potentials) were rarely observed in these early growth cone-muscle contacts. Although there were several inherent difficulties, quantal analysis of the end-plate potentials was attempted by using binomial statistics. This analysis suggests that nerve-evoked transmitter release at the growth cone occurs in a quantal fashion.

3884749|a|When a spherical muscle cell (myoball) was manipulated into contact with either the soma or the neurite of an isolated neuron in 2-day-old Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures, depolarizations similar to miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs) were frequently detected in the muscle cell. These depolarizations occurred within minutes after myoball-soma contact and within seconds after myoball-neurite contact. They had time course and amplitude distribution similar to those of the MEPPs recorded from naturally occurring neuromuscular synapses between neurites and muscle cells found in the same cultures, but they occurred at a lower frequency and had smaller average amplitudes. These depolarizations were induced by acetylcholine (ACh) since they were reversibly blocked by addition of d-tubocurarine into the culture, and they were abolished in muscle cells pretreated with alpha-bungarotoxin before contact with the neuron. Greater than 60% of the neuronal population in these cultures released ACh upon this direct muscle contact. The appearance of MEPP-like potentials in the myoball upon contact with an isolated neuron suggests that the cellular machinery responsible for ACh release is present throughout the neuron and that packages of ACh molecules are available for release prior to nerve-muscle synapse formation. We also found that neurons which had previously made synapse with other muscle cells in the culture all failed to release ACh from the soma and showed reduced release capability at the neurite for the first 30 min to 1 hr of contact with a myoball. This finding suggests that, during synapatogenesis, there is a depletion of ACh molecules and/or substances responsible for the triggering of their release in the extrasynaptic regions of the neuron.

2862224|a|Environmental factors can influence cultured sympathetic neurons to acquire several different neurotransmitter phenotypes. Cholinergic and noradrenergic transmitter status can be influenced by heart cell conditioned medium, chronic depolarization (Patterson, P. H. (1978) Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1:1-17), and rat serum (Wolinsky, E. J., and P. H. Patterson, (1985) J. Neurosci. 5:1509-1512); formation of electrical synapses can be induced by insulin (Wolinsky, E. J., H. Patterson, and A. L. Willard (1985) J. Neurosci., 5:1675-1679). Purine release has also been proposed as a possible transmission mode for sympathetic neurons (Potter, D. D., E. J. Furshpan, and S. C. Landis (1983) Fred. Proc. 42:1626-1632), and as such, it is another candidate for environmental modulation. In this report, we assess the ability of sympathetic neuron cultures grown with and without serum to release metabolically labeled tritriated purine compounds in response to depolarization. Exposure to 54 mM potassium stimulated release of adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine from both serum-supplemented and defined-medium cultures. However, depolarization-stimulated release of adenine nucleotides was observed only from serum-supplemented cultures and not from serum-free cultures. The release of adenine nucleotides from serum-containing cultures is affected by divalent cations in the manner expected for a neurosecretory process. The failure of serum-free cultures to release detectable adenine nucleotides raises the possibility that they do not share with, or that they differ from, serum-supplemented cultures in the purinergic aspect of the multiple transmission modes available to sympathetic neurons, and that this difference may be due to effects of the culture medium.

The tumors were grouped into those with irregular (3 cases) and those with round and regular nuclei (4 cases). In both groups, variation in cell size, numerous histiocytes and vessels, and many mitoses were distinguishing features. In only 1 case in the round and regular nucleus group was there relatively little variation in cell size and a paucity of histiocytes. Abundant polyribosomes, long strands of rough endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomal granules were prominent electron microscopic features in both groups of tumors. The clinical presentations and courses varied considerably, especially in patients with tumors of the round nucleus type. One patient presented initially with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1 with Lennert's lymphoma, another with bone marrow infiltration, and a fourth with subcutaneous tumors. Two patients with the round nucleus type are still alive one and a half and two years after the original diagnosis. Two patients died two years after the onset of symptoms. Each of the 3 patients with tumors of the irregular nucleus type had a rapid clinical course and died within ten months.

6198355|a|A murine monoclonal antibody specific for calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase has been prepared and used in an unlabeled antibody bridge technique for labeling monoclonal antibodies. This procedure--the alkaline phosphatase monoclonal anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method--gives excellent immunocytochemical labeling of tissue sections and cell smears, comparable in clarity and intensity to that achieved with immunoperoxidase labeling. If the enzyme label is developed with a naphthol salt as a coupling agent and Fast Red or hexazotized new fuchsin as a capture agent, a vivid red reaction product is obtained which is very easily detected by the human eye. For this reason the APAAP technique was found particularly suitable for labeling cell smears (for both cytoplasmic and surface-membrane antigens) and for detecting low numbers of antigen-bearing cells in a specimen (e.g., carcinoma cells in a malignant effusion). It was found possible to enhance the intensity of the APAAP labeling reaction substantially by repeating the second and third incubation steps (i.e., the unlabelled "bridge" antibody and APAAP complexes). The APAAP technique was superior to immunoperoxidase labeling for staining tissues rich in endogenous peroxidase, and could be used in conjunction with immunoperoxidase methods for double immunoenzymatic staining. The method was also applicable to the detection of antigenic molecules following their electrophoretic transfer from SDS-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose sheets ("immunoblotting").

769865|a|Mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes recently have been shown to release colony-stimulating activity (CSA), a stimulator of granulopoiesis in vitro. Whether CSA release is a result of specific antigen-lymphocyte interactions has been investigated by determining the ability of spleen lymphocytes isolated from Trichinella spiralis and Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) infected mice to release CSA. Lymphocytes were incubated with different antigens to obtain conditioned media (CM). Conditioned media prepared from Trichinella-sensitized lymphocytes incubated with Trichinella antigen (CM-1) resulted in a fourfold increase in the number of colonies from murine marrow cultured in methylcellulose as compared to controls. The addition of Trichinella antigen to either nonsensitized or BCG-sensitized lymphocytes did not stimulate CSA release. Similar results were obtained with lymphocytes from BCG-infected mice. Liquid cultures stimulated with CM resulted in an increase in 3h-thymidine incorporation and cell numbers. Using CM-1 to stimulate marrow from Trichinella-infected mice resulted in a three- to fourfold increase in the number of eosinophils present after 4 days. All other CMs tested stimulated only neutrophil production...

6434993|a|The humoral immune system antigen-binding proteins (immunoglobulins) are disulphide-linked heterodimers of light and heavy chains. The gene for the variable region which determines antigen specificity is assembled when one member from each of the dispersed clusters of variable (V) gene segments, diversity (D) elements (for the heavy chains only) and joining (J) segments rearrange and fuse during B-cell development (reviewed in ref. 1). Short recognition sequences adjacent to these elements appear to be involved in the recombination process. The cellular immune system antigen recognition proteins are receptors on the surface of T cells, which are composed of disulphide-linked alpha-chains and beta-chains, each of which has a variable and constant region. Recently, cDNA clones of the beta-chain mRNA have been isolated; the genomic arrangement is very similar to immunoglobulin genes with multiple V beta genes, and two clusters of J beta segments, each of which is upstream from a constant-region gene segment. The V beta and J beta segments have adjacent recombinational recognition sequences like the immunoglobulin elements. However, approximately 10 nucleotides of the cDNA clones between the V beta and J beta regions were not present in the corresponding genomic elements and may have been due to intervening D beta segments. Here we describe a diversity element (D beta 1.1) in a region of high human-mouse homology about 650 bases 5' to the first J beta cluster. Two transcripts which include sequences upstream of D beta 1.1 are found in the human thymus. This region may have some other function besides providing the beta-chain with a diversity segment.

In a cloned cytolytic T lymphocyte, 2C, one of each of these fragments has productively rearranged to yield an expressed VJC transcription unit, which shows no evidence for somatic mutation. Short sequences similar to those implicated in immunoglobulin gene and T cell receptor beta chain gene rearrangement flank the V and J segments of this family. The linkage of two of the three V gene segments has been determined: the segments lie approximately 2.5 kb apart, and are arranged head-to-head. The inverted arrangement may cast light upon the mechanisms utilized by lymphocytes for gene rearrangement.

3156277|a|Rearrangements of T-cell receptor beta-chain genes are usually found on both chromosomal homologues, occurring by both deletional and non-deletional mechanisms. Two constant-region (C beta) genes have been identified previously and at least one is transcribed in every helper or cytotoxic T cell tested, but the choice of C beta gene expression is not correlated with the specialized functions of these T lymphocytes. By contrast, four of five suppressor T-cell hybridomas examined have deleted all known joining (J beta) gene segments and C beta genes and therefore may have antigen receptors encoded by different T-cell receptor gene families.

2993907|a|T lymphocytes recognize cell-bound antigens in the molecular context of the self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products through the surface T-cell receptor(s). The minimal component of the T-cell receptor is a heterodimer composed of alpha and beta subunits, each of relative molecular mass (Mr) approximately 45,000 (refs 1-3). Recently, complementary DNA clones encoding these subunits have been isolated and characterized along with that of a third subunit of unknown function, termed gamma (refs 4-9). These studies revealed a primary structure for each subunit that was clearly similar to that of immunoglobulin and indicated a somatic rearrangement of corresponding genes that are also immunoglobulin-like. Recently, the analysis of the sequence organization of the T-cell receptor beta-chain and T-cell-specific gamma-chain gene families has been reported. We now present an initial characterization of the murine T-cell receptor alpha-chain gene family, and conclude that although it is clearly related to the gene families encoding immunoglobulins, T-cell receptor beta-chains and also T-cell gamma-chains, it shows unique characteristics. There is only a single constant (C) region gene segment, which is an exceptionally large distance (approximately 20-40 kilobases (kb) in the cases studied here) from joining (J) gene segments. In addition, the J cluster and the variable (V) segment number seen to be very large. Finally, in the case studied here, a complete alpha-chain gene shows no somatic mutation and can be assembled directly from V alpha, J alpha and C alpha segments without inclusion of diversity (D alpha) segments.

2993908|a|The vertebrate immune system uses two kinds of antigen-specific receptors, the immunoglobulin molecules of B cells and the antigen receptors of T cells. T-cell receptors are formed by a combination of two different polypeptide chains, alpha and beta (refs 1-3). Three related gene families are expressed in T cells, those encoding the T-cell receptor, alpha and beta, and a third, gamma (refs 4-6), whose function is unknown. Each of these polypeptide chains can be divided into variable (V) and constant (C) regions. The V beta regions are encoded by V beta, diversity (D beta) and joining (J beta) gene segments that rearrange in the differentiating T cell to generate V beta genes. The V gamma regions are encoded by V gamma, J gamma and, possibly, D gamma gene segments. Studies of alpha complementary DNA clones suggest that alpha-polypeptides have V alpha and C alpha regions and are encoded by V alpha and J alpha gene segments and a C alpha gene. Elsewhere in this issue we demonstrate that 18 of 19 J alpha sequences examined are distinct, indicating that the J alpha gene segment repertoire is much larger than those of the immunoglobulin (4-5) or beta (14) gene families. Here we report the germline structures of one V alpha and six J alpha mouse gene segments and demonstrate that the structures of the V alpha and J alpha gene segments and the alpha-recognition sequences for DNA rearrangement are similar to those of their immunoglobulin and beta-chain counterparts. We also show that the J alpha gene-segment organization is strikingly different from that of the other immunoglobulin and rearranging T-cell gene families. Eighteen J alpha gene segments map over 60 kilobases (kb) of DNA 5' to the C alpha gene.

3865189|a|We have cloned three pairs of rearranged and germ-line variable region (V beta) genes of the beta chain of the human T-cell receptor from the cell lines ATL2, ATL12, and MT-1 of patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The pairs were derived from the same (for ATL2 and ATL12) and different (for MT-1) individuals. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences showed no somatic mutation in V beta X ATL2 and beta X ATL12-2. Although one nucleotide change was found in V beta X MT1-1, the possibility of polymorphism was not excluded. These results indicate that the frequency of somatic mutation in the V beta gene of the T-cell receptor is 1/10th or less than that in the immunoglobulin gene. Both alleles of the rearranged T-cell receptor gene were analyzed for ATL12 and MT-1. In both, only one of the two rearranged J beta alleles was an active variable-diversity-joining (V-D-J) complex. The results suggest that allelic exclusion occurs in the T-cell receptor gene.

6605197|a|The human T cell receptor for antigen (Ti) has recently been identified on IL-2 dependent T cell clones as a 90 kd disulfide-linked heterodimer comprised of one 49-51 kd alpha (alpha) and one 43 kd beta (beta) chain. These subunits are noncovalently associated with a monomorphic 20-25 kd T3 molecule. Here, we produce monoclonal antibodies to a human tumor (REX) derived from an earlier stage of thymic differentiation in order to determine whether clonotypic structures are expressed and to define the ontogeny of Ti. The results of SDS-PAGE and peptide map analyses indicate that an homologous T3-associated heterodimer is synthesized and expressed by REX. This glycoprotein shares several peptides in common with clonotypic structures on an IL-2 dependent T cell clone. In addition, similar Ti related molecules appear during intrathymic ontogeny in parallel with surface T3 expression. The latter findings provide the structural basis for the immunological competence observed exclusively within the T3+ thymocyte compartment.

The two receptors proved to have very similar gross structures, being 70-85 kd proteins, and reducing to an acidic alpha-chain and a slightly basic beta-chain, each 40-43 kd. The charge of both the acidic and basic polypeptides varied between the two receptors studied, showing that variable amino acid sequences occur in both chains.

This antiserum immunoprecipitates a family of disulfide-bonded dimers from normal thymocytes and T cells, but is unreactive with B cells. Peptide maps prepared after limited proteolytic digestion indicate that the molecules from the different cell populations have homologous primary structures. Comparison of two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps indicate that, in addition to several common peptides, the molecules exhibit considerable structural heterogeneity. Taken together, these data indicate that the T-cell-specific heteroduplex has regions of constant and variable structure consistent with the properties expected for the T cell antigen receptor.

111144|a|The entire nucleotide sequence of a 1.7-kilobase embryonic DNA fragment containing five joining (J) DNA segments for mouse immunoglobulin kappa chain gene has been determined. Each J DNA segment can encode amino acid residues 96--108. Comparison of one of the five J DNA sequences with those of an embryonic variable (V) gene and a complete kappa chain gene permitted localisation of a precise recombination site. The 5'-flanking regions of J DNA segments could form an inverted stem structure with the 3'-non-coding region of embryonic V genes. This hypothetical structure and gel-blotting analysis of total embryo and myeloma DNA suggest that the somatic recombination may be accompanied by excision of an entire DNA segment between a V gene and a J DNA segment. Antibody diversity may in part be generated by modulation of the precise recombination sites.

6777777|a|A site-specific recombination event is responsible for the somatic activation of immunoglobulin genes and for generating a major share of immunoglobulin gene diversity. Although several possible mechanisms can be proposed to account for this process, recombinatio accompanied by deletion is a particularly attractive mechanism because it might utilize inverted repeat sequences noted on the 3' side of all variable regions and on the 5' side of all joining site segments thus far studied. Testing this model is complicated by the fact that antibody cells are at least diploid and gene segments on the inactive chromosome can obscure deletions occurring within the active gene. Accordingly, we have screened several immunoglobulin-producing plasmacytoma lines to select those in which both chromosomes are rearranged. By using appropriate cell lines and variable and joining region probes in in situ hybridization experiments, we show that recombination is accompanied by the deletion of both variable and joining region genes. These experiments also allow us to map the site of V/J recombination of several active immunoglobulin genes and suggest an order and orientation for variable, joining, and constant region sequences.

6287467|a|A chromosomal segment with a unique structure around the immunoglobulin heavy chain joining region (JH) has been molecularly cloned from an Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed cell line. Attached to JH3 in the cloned DNA, in inverted sequence, is the DNA from JH1 to the JH2 recognition sequence. The inverted segment is attached at its other end to the 5' recognition sequence of a diversity segment (D). To form this structure, three joining events must have occurred on the same chromosome. One of these events could have been a normal D-JH joining but the others must have been irregular events including ones that result in inversions. One of the joining events left fused recognition elements from JH2 and a D whose sequence shows that, during joining, reciprocal joinings of the recognition elements must occur to fuse the heptameric elements back to back. Because joined D and JH undergo deletion of terminal coding sequence during recombination but the joined heptameric recognition sequences do not contain the deleted sequence, joining must be a nonreciprocal event. Also, extra nucleotides are inserted between D and JH as part of the joining process; it is suggested that this added sequence is a product of the activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase at the D/JH (and probably the VH/D) joints and that it represents a new element of heavy chain gene structure, the N region.

6804938|a|A systematic analysis of the fate of the DNA between kappa chain variable (V kappa) and joining (J kappa) genes in cells that have rearranged kappa loci was carried out. The DNA from a variety of kappa-producing plasmacytomas, lambda-producing hybridomas, and kappa-expressing lymphocytes was digested, fractionated by size, and analyzed with two probes containing sequences 5' of J kappa. In 13 of 28 plasmacytomas examined the rearrangement of V kappa and J kappa appears to be accompanied by loss of DNA upstream of J kappa. However, in the rest of the plasmacytomas one or more upstream sequences are retained in a new context. In 9 of 12 lambda-producing hybridomas (which frequently rearrange both kappa loci) one or more upstream segments were detected. These unique fragments were probably generated by a recombination event near or at the J kappa region. The extent to which the region between V and J is maintained in kappa-expression lymphocytes was also measured. Most (76%) of the region upstream of J kappa is retained in the population, even though 68% of the kappa loci are rearranged. In order to explain how these upstream elements occur in some, but not all, cell lines, and the significant occurrence in the lymphocyte population, we propose a model in which a step in V--J joining involves mitotic recombination by unequal sister chromatid exchange.

6803241|a|The mechanism of generating immunoglobulin light chain genes by rearrangement of variable (V), joining (J), and constant (C) gene segments is still unknown. It has been discussed mostly in terms of excision and deletion of the DNA between the recombined V and J gene segments. However, the finding of DNA digests from the mouse myeloma T of a fragment (called f-T) that contains the 3' flank of a V kappa and the 5' flank of a J1 gene segment argued against a simple deletion mechanism [Steinmetz, M., Altenburger, W. & Zachau, H. G. (1980) Nucleic Acids Res. 8, 1709--1720]. The origin of fragment f-T has now been investigated by cloning and determining the sequence of the germ-line V gene segment that apparently participated in its formation. Moreover, analogous fragments containing flanking sequences were isolated from the myelomas MOPC 173 and 41 (f-173 and f-41) and studied by sequence analysis. The f fragments appear to be recombination products of V--J rearrangements reciprocal to rearranged kappa genes but, at least in the cases of f-T and f-173, not of the rearranged V genes present in the same tumor cell. This fact is best explained by a sister chromatid exchange mechanism of V--J recombination because, by this model, the rearranged V genes and the reciprocal flank recombination products would segregate into different cells during the following mitosis. The possibility is suggested that there exists in lymphocyte differentiation more than one mechanism of V--J recombination.

6295880|a|The strategy of shotgun cloning with M13 is based on obtaining random fragments used for the rapid accumulation of sequence data. A strategy, however, is sometimes needed for obtaining subcloned sequences preferentially out of a mixture of fragments. Shotgun sequencing experiments have shown that not all DNA fragments are obtained with the same frequency and that the redundant information increases during the last third of a sequencing project. In addition, experiments have shown that particular fragments are obtained more frequently in one orientation, allowing the use of only one of the two DNA strands as a template for M13 shotgun sequencing. Two new M13 vectors, M13mp8 and M13mp9, have been constructed that permit the cloning of the same restriction fragment in both possible orientations. Consequently, each of the two strands becomes a (+) strand in a pair of vectors. The fragments to be cloned are cleaved with two restriction enzymes to produce a fragment with two different ends. The insertion of such a fragment into the vector can occur only in one orientation. Since M13mp8 and M13mp9 have their array of cloning sites in an antiparallel order, either orientation for inserting a double-digest fragment can be selected by the choice of the vector.

The HH5 actin has only one amino acid substitution, from Gly-336 to Ser. In KM129, the C-terminal part of actin is replaced by novel amino acids. KM88 is a null allele, with an amber mutation early in the coding region of the mutated actin gene. Although all of the KM75, HH5 and KM129 actins have defects near the C-terminus, only hsp-inducing mutant actins cause enlargement of the IFM nuclei as well as a disruption of myofibrils even in the presence of two copies of the normal genes. We further consider the underlying mechanisms linking these features of the hsp-inducing alleles.

The third segment, identified in a form joined with a JHDNA segment in a T cell, carries the recognition signal on the 5' side. These results support the 12/23-base pair model for somatic generation of immunoglobulin V genes, and rule out the possibility that the cytolytic T cells use assembled VH, D and JH sequences to encode their antigen receptors.

6798155|a|We have identified, cloned, and sequenced eight different DNA segments encoding the diversity (D) regions of mouse immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. Like the two D segments previously characterized (16, 17), all eight D segments are flanked by characteristic heptamers and nonamers separated by 12-bp spacers. These 10 D segments, and several more D segments identified but not yet sequenced, can be classified into three families based on the extent of sequence homology. The SP2 family consists of nine highly homologous D segments that are all 17-bp long and clustered in a chromosomal region of approximately 60 kb. The FL16 family consists of up to four D segments, two of which were mapped in the 5' end region of the SP2-D cluster. The two FL16D segments are 23 and 17 bp long. The third, the Q52 family, is a single-member family of the 10-bp-long DQ52, located 700 bp 5' to the JH cluster. We argue that the D-region sequences of the majority of heavy chain genes arise from these germline D segments by various somatic mechanisms, including joining of multiple D segments. We present a specific model of D-D joining that does not violate the 12/23-bp spacer rule.

We postulate that these 14 nucleotides are encoded by a third gene segment analogous to the diversity (D) gene segments of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. This T cell antigen receptor V gene appears to be assembled from three gene segments, V, D, and J, and accordingly most closely resembles immunoglobulin heavy chain V genes.

2412120|a|Only 10 different V beta gene segments were found when the sequences of 15 variable (V beta) genes of the mouse T-cell receptor were examined. From this analysis we calculate that the total number of expressed V beta gene segments may be 21 or fewer, which makes the expressed germline V beta repertoire much smaller than that of immunoglobulin heavy-chain or light-chain genes. We suggest that beta-chain somatic diversification is concentrated at the V beta-D beta-J beta junctions.

3875151|a|Fifteen independently isolated complementary DNA clones that contain T-cell receptor (TCR) V beta genes were sequenced and found to represent 11 different V beta genes. When compared with known sequences, 14 different V beta genes could be defined from a total of 25 complementary DNA's; 11 clones therefore involved repeated usage of previously identified V beta's. Based on these data, we calculate a maximum likelihood estimate of the number of expressed germline V beta genes to be 18 with an upper 95 percent confidence bound of 30 genes. Southern blot analysis has shown that most of these genes belong to single element subfamilies which show very limited interstrain polymorphism. The TCR beta-chain diversity appears to be generated from a limited V beta gene pool primarily by extensive variability at the variable-diversity-joining (V-D-J) junctional site, with no evidence for the involvement of somatic hypermutation.

6316256|a|We have examined the organization of the immunoglobulin JH segments in three clones derived from a single Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed cell. Cloning and nucleotide sequence analyses of the JH-containing fragments have revealed the rearrangement from the preformed D-JH complex to the complete VH-D-JH gene, which was accompanied by the expression of the intra-cytoplasmic mu chain. In one case a JH segment downstream to the preformed D-JH was used to create a new VH-D-JH gene. Upon the D-JH and VH-D-JH rearrangements the intervening D segments were deleted from the chromosome. One of the expressed VH genes suffered from a large deletion of the 3' portion (including the 95th cysteine residue) of the VH segment. We discuss the possible mechanism of the allelic exclusion.

6086308|a|The immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region is encoded as three separate libraries of elements in germ-line DNA: VH, D and JH. To examine the order and regulation of their joining, we have developed assays that distinguish their various combinations and have used the assays to study tumor cell analogs of B-lymphoid cells as well as normal B-lymphoid cells. Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) transformed fetal liver cells - the most primitive B-lymphoid cell analog available for analysis - generally had DJH rearrangements at both JH loci. These lines continued DNA rearrangement in culture, in most cases by joining a VH gene segment to an existing DJH complex with the concomitant deletion of intervening DNA sequences. None of these lines or their progeny showed evidence of VHD or DD rearrangements. Heavy chain-producing tumor lines, representing more mature stages of the B-cell pathway, and normal B-lymphocytes had either two VHDJH rearrangements or a VHDJH plus a DJH rearrangement at their two heavy chain loci; they also showed no evidence of VHD or DD rearrangements. These results support an ordered mechanism of variable gene assembly during B-cell differentiation in which D-to-JH rearrangements generally occur first and on both chromosomes followed by VH-to-DJH rearrangements, with both types of joining processes occurring by intrachromosomal deletion. The high percentage of JH alleles remaining in the DJH configuration in heavy chain-producing lines and, especially, in normal B-lymphocytes supports a regulated mechanism of heavy chain allelic exclusion in which a VHDJH rearrangement, if productive, prevents an additional VH-to-DJH rearrangement.

6995553|a|The alloantiserum-dependent lysis of TLX9 lymphoma cells by peritoneal cells from Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-treated mice was inhibited 62 percent by depletion of oxygen. This effect did not appear to be a result of interference with mitochondrial respiration because cyanide, azide, and dinitrophenol did not inhibit cytotoxicity. Preincubating the effector cells for 2 h without glucose, which markedly reduces their ability to release hydrogen peroxide, likewise suppressed antibody-dependent cytolysis by 62 percent. Lysis of sensitized lymphoma cells was virtually abolished by 6 mg/ml of thioglycollate broth, a concentration that also abrogated the detectable release of hydrogen peroxide and the lysis of lymphoma cells by BCG-activated macrophages in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). This concentration of thioglycollate broth was not toxic to the effector cells, as judged by adherence to plastic, binding of opsonized erythrocytes, and phagocytosis of radiolabeled starch granules. Catalase, superoxide dismutase, horseradish peroxidase, mannitol, ethanol, benzoate, and diazabicyclooctane were without consistent effects. Cytochalasin B and dihydrocytochalasin B both markedly suppressed cytolysis, whether induced by antibody or by PMA (ID(50), 0.5 mug/ml). Cytoehalasin B was an equally potent suppressor of glucose uptake and PMA-induced hydrogen peroxide release by BCG-activated macrophages (ID(50), 0.5 mug/ml). However, dihydrocytochalasin B lacked these latter effects, which suggests that cytotoxicity required intact contractile elements. The extracellular lysis of antibody-coated lymphoma cells by BCG-activated macrophages appears to have a predominantly oxidative basis.

216763|a|When deprived of oxygen, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-activated macrophages no longer lysed P388 lymphoma cells. Both H2O2 release and cytotoxicity by BCG-activated macrophages and by granulocytes triggered with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were markedly inhibited when the glucose concentration in the medium was reduced to 0.03 mM or less, or if glucose were replaced with galactose. Catalase abolished PMA-triggered cytotoxicity by both types of effector cells, whereas superoxide dismutase had no effect. Ferricytochrome C reduced the cytotoxicity of BCG-activated macrophages, an effect which was largely reversed by superoxide dismutase. 10 drugs, thought to quench singlet oxygen and/or scavenge hydroxyl radical, did not affect cytotoxicity in this system. Neither azide nor cyanide reduced cytolysis, but there was marked inhibition by lactoperoxidase and iodide. This suggested that cytotoxicity was not dependent upon myeloperoxidase, and that lactoperoxidase may have diverted H2O2 from the oxidation of target cells to oxidation of substances in serum. Mouse erythrocytes, although sensitive targets, interfered with the cytolysis of lymphoma cells, probably by competition for H2O2. Starch particles with covalently bound glucose oxidase resembled macrophages in their spatial relation to the target cells and in the flux of H2O2 they generated from their surface, but were not expected to produce any other potentially toxic products. Such particles lysed lymphoma cells, and the lysis was prevented by catalase. Neither arginase nor thymidine appeared to be involved in cytolysis by BCG-activated macrophages under the conditions used. These findings demonstrated that release of H2O2 was both necessary and sufficient for cytolysis by BCG-activated macrophages and by granulocytes when pharmacologically triggered.

6283263|a|Phagocytic leukocytes are motile cells capable of inducing damage and lysis of a wide variety of biologic targets. Recent insights into the mechanisms of phagocyte-mediated destruction have derived from the observation that these cells can consume and metabolize oxygen to generate an impressive array of reactive oxygen intermediates. The role of oxygen metabolites in antimicrobial defense mechanisms has been the subject of intensive study, but only recently has attention focused on the potential importance of oxygen in phagocyte-mammalian cell interactions. In this review we will examine evidence obtained in a variety of in vitro model systems demonstrating the ability of intact phagocytes to generate oxygen metabolites capable of destroying normal or neoplastic cells. A basic understanding of the biochemistry of phagocyte-mediated oxygen-dependent events should allow us to elucidate and potentially modulate immunologic defenses against neoplastic invasion, the destruction of normal tissue in pathogenic states, and the course of the inflammatory response. The role of phagocyte-derived oxygen metabolites in microbicidal activity will not be the subject of this report, and the reader is referred to recent comprehensive reviews.

6268662|a|Human neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate were able to destroy suspensions or monolayers of cultured human endothelial cells. Neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity was related to phorbol myristate acetate concentration, time of incubation and neutrophil number. Cytolysis was prevented by the addition of catalase, while superoxide dismutase had no effect on cytotoxicity. The addition of the heme-enzyme inhibitors, azide or cyanide, markedly stimulated neutrophil-mediated damage while exogenous myeloperoxidase failed to stimulate cytolysis. Neutrophils isolated from patients with chronic granulomatous disease did not destroy the endothelial cell targets while myeloperoxidase-deficient neutrophils successfully mediated cytotoxicity. Endothelial cell damage mediated by the myeloperoxidase deficient cells was also inhibited by catalase but not superoxide dismutase. The addition of purified myeloperoxidase to the deficient cells did not stimulate cytotoxicity. Glucose-glucose oxidase, an enzyme system capable of generating hydrogen peroxide, could replace the neutrophil as the cytotoxic mediator. The addition of myeloperoxidase at low concentrations of glucose oxidase did not increase cytolysis, but at the higher concentrations of glucose oxidase it stimulated cytotoxicity. The destruction of endothelial cells by the glucose oxidase-myeloperoxidase system was inhibited by the addition of hypochlorous acid scavengers. In contrast, neutrophil-mediated cytolysis was not effectively inhibited by the hypochlorous acid scavengers. Based on these observations, we propose that human neutrophils can destroy cultured human endothelial cells by generating cytotoxic quantities of hydrogen peroxide.

7033282|a|Neutrophil-mediated endothelial injury was assessed in vitro using assays of cell lysis and cell detachment. Activation of human peripheral blood neutrophils adherent to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers by serum-treated zymosan produced dose-dependent endothelial cell detachment without concomitant cell lysis. This injury was inhibited by neutral protease inhibitors, but not by catalase or superoxide dismutase. Neutrophils from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease also produced endothelial cell detachment when activated by serum-treated zymosan similar to normal neutrophils. Endothelial detachment was also produced by cell-free postsecretory media from activated neutrophils or by partially purified human neutrophil granule fraction and was inhibitable by tryptic, elastase, and serine protease inhibitors, but not by an acid protease inhibitor. Analysis of iodinated endothelial cell surface proteins that had been exposed to partially purified neutrophil granule fraction showed complete loss of proteins migrating in the region of fibronectin by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This result was prevented in the presence of neutral protease inhibitors. We conclude that neutrophil-derived neutral proteases mediate endothelial cell detachment in vitro through digestion of endothelial cell surface proteins including fibronectin.

2997279|a|To investigate mechanisms whereby oxidant injury of cells results in cell dysfunction and death, cultured endothelial cells or P388D1 murine macrophage-like cells were exposed to oxidants including H2O2, O2-. (generated by the enzymatic oxidation of xanthine), or to stimulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Although Trypan Blue exclusion was not diminished before 30 min, cellular ATP was found to fall to less than 30% of control values within 3 min of exposure to 5 mM H2O2. Stimulated PMN plus P388D1 caused a 50% fall in cellular ATP levels. During the first minutes of oxidant injury, total adenylate content of cells fell by 85%. Cellular ADP increased 170%, AMP increased 900%, and an 83% loss of ATP was accompanied by a stoichiometric increase in IMP and inosine. Calculated energy charge [(ATP + 1/2 AMP)/(ATP + ADP + AMP)] fell from 0.95 to 0.66. Exposure of P388D1 to oligomycin plus 2-deoxyglucose (which inhibit oxidative and glycolytic generation of ATP, respectively) resulted in a rate of ATP fall similar to that induced by H2O2. In addition, nucleotide alterations induced by exposure to oligomycin plus 2-deoxyglucose were qualitatively similar to those induced by the oxidant. Loss of cell adenylates could not be explained by arrest of de novo purine synthesis or increased ATP consumption by the Na+-K+ ATPase or the mitochondrial F0-ATPase. These results indicate that H2O2 causes a rapid and profound fall in cellular ATP levels similar to that seen when ATP production is arrested by metabolic inhibitors.

2991339|a|Oxidative damage to the vascular endothelium may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and aging, and may account in part for reduced vascular prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis associated with both conditions. Using H2O2 to induce injury, we investigated the effects of oxidative damage on PGI2 synthesis in cultured endothelial cells (EC). Preincubation of EC with H2O2 produced a dose-dependent inhibition (inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 35 microM) of PGI2 formation from arachidonate. The maximum dose-related effect occurred within 1 min after exposure although appreciable H2O2 remained after 30 min (30% of original). In addition, H2O2 produced both a time- and dose-dependent injury leading to cell disruption, lactate dehydrogenase release, and 51Cr release from prelabeled cells. However, in dramatic contrast to H2O2 effects on PGI2 synthesis, loss of cellular integrity required doses in excess of 0.5 mM and incubation times in excess of 1 h. The superoxide-generating system, xanthine plus xanthine oxidase, produced a similar inhibition of PGI2 formation. Such inhibition was dependent on the generation of H2O2 but not superoxide in that catalase was completely protective whereas superoxide dismutase was not. H2O2 (50 microM) also effectively inhibited basal and ionophore A23187 (0.5 microM)-stimulated PGI2 formation. However, H2O2 had no effect on phospholipase A2 activity, because ionophore A23187-induced arachidonate release was unimpaired. To determine the effects on cyclooxygenase and PGI2 synthase, prostaglandin products from cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonate and stimulated with ionophore A23187, or products formed from exogenous arachidonate were examined. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase but not PGI2 synthase was observed. Incubation of H2O2-treated cells with prostaglandin cyclic endoperoxide indicated no inhibition of PGI2 synthase. Thus, in EC low doses of H2O2 potently inhibit cyclooxygenase after brief exposure whereas larger doses and prolonged exposure are required for classical cytolytic effects. Surprisingly, PGI2 synthase, which is known to be extremely sensitive to a variety of lipid peroxides, is not inhibited by H2O2. Lipid solubility, enzyme location within the EC membrane, or the local availability of reducing factors may explain these results, and may be important determinants of the response of EC to oxidative stress.

6363599|a|The responses of pig aortic endothelial cells to sublethal doses of potentially toxic stimuli were investigated by monitoring K+ efflux, prostaglandin production, and the release of cytoplasmic purines. Xanthine plus xanthine oxidase reversibly stimulated these three parameters of endothelial cell function at doses that were not cytotoxic, as measured by chromium release, adenine uptake, and vital dye exclusion. The effects of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase were inhibited by catalase but not by superoxide dismutase, suggesting that H2O2 was responsible. Reagent H2O2 also reversibly stimulated K+ efflux, prostaglandin production, and the release of purines. The threshold concentration of H2O2 for these effects was approximately 10 microM, which was at least 30-fold lower than that which caused cytotoxicity. In addition to the direct effect of H2O2 in stimulating prostaglandin production (PGI2 and PGE2), prior exposure of endothelial cells to lower doses of H2O2 (less than 0.1 microM) at high oxygen tension inhibited the subsequent stimulation of prostaglandin production by ATP, A23187, and H2O2 itself. We conclude that H2O2 has substantial effects on endothelial physiology at doses up to 3,000-fold lower than those which induce cytotoxicity.

3838256|a|To determine whether reactive oxygen molecules could directly and reversibly increase the transfer of albumin across an endothelial barrier, we measured albumin transfer across monolayers of endothelium cultured on micropore filters before and after exposure to xanthine and xanthine oxidase. Xanthine and xanthine oxidase increased endothelial albumin transfer in a dose-dependent fashion. Parallel phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated retraction of adjacent cells from one another and disruption of the actin filaments. The oxidant-induced increases in albumin transfer and changes in cell shape were reversed by removing xanthine oxidase and then incubating the monolayers for 3 1/2 hours in tissue culture media enriched with fetal bovine serum. However, incubation in tissue culture media without serum resulted in progressive injury and cell death. Hence, the brief exposure to oxidants initiated a progressive injury process that was reversed by incubation in serum. Because intracellular and extracellular calcium are important determinants of cell shape, and because some oxidized membrane lipids act as calcium ionophores, we asked whether oxidants altered endothelial calcium homeostasis. Xanthine-xanthine oxidase increased release of 45Ca++ from preloaded cells. The calcium antagonist lanthanum chloride prevented xanthine-xanthine oxidase increases in endothelial albumin transfer and prevented the changes in cell shape; chelation of extracellular calcium inhibited lysis of endothelium by xanthine-xanthine oxidase; and the calcium ionophore A23187 increased endothelial albumin transfer and mimicked the oxidant-induced changes in cell shape. Lanthanum chloride inhibited these effects of A23187. These data suggest that oxygen radicals can reversibly increase endothelial permeability to macromolecules, that this is associated with reversible changes in endothelial cell shape and actin filaments, and that the changes in cell shape are related to oxidant-induced changes in endothelial calcium homeostasis.

2999509|a|Human blood neutrophils stimulated by a variety of agents were shown to have cytotoxic effects on bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Effective agonists included immune complexes, opsonized zymosan and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. Unstimulated human neutrophils and neutrophils stimulated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or with platelet-activating factor failed to induce significant killing even though secretory release of lysosomal enzymes occurred. In comparing the effects of the different agonists, endothelial cell killing showed a better correlation with the production of H2O2 than with the generation of O2-. Endothelial cell killing by stimulated human neutrophils was inhibited by catalase but not by soybean trypsin inhibitor or superoxide dismutase. Killing was also inhibited by two scavengers (N, N-dimethylthiourea and D-mannitol) of hydroxyl radical and by deferoxamine mesylate, an iron-chelator. Iron-saturated deferoxamine mesylate was significantly less effective in protecting the endothelial cells against killing. Agents that were protective against endothelial cell killing did not interfere with the generation of O2- in stimulated neutrophils. These results suggest that leukocyte-induced endothelial cell killing in vitro can be induced by some but not all agonists for neutrophils and that the killing is oxygen-dependent and may be directly due to hydroxyl radical production.

Treatment of endothelial cells with buthionine sulfoximine, an irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, depleted the cells of GSH, while L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate, an effective intracellular cysteine delivery agent, markedly enhanced endothelial cell GSH concentration. Depletion of intracellular GSH sensitized the endothelial cells to injury by H2O2 either preformed or generated by the glucose-glucose oxidase system. In contrast, an increase of intracellular GSH protected the cells from H2O2 damage. There was an inverse, linear relationship between the intracellular GSH concentrations and killing of endothelial cells by H2O2. Our results suggest that enhancement of endothelial cell GSH may be an alternative approach toward the prevention of oxidant-induced endothelial damage such as adult respiratory distress syndrome.

6688807|a|Increased intracellular production of oxygen radicals is a major etiology of cell damage from many quinoid antibiotics, environmental toxicants, and hyperoxia. Enhancing the intracellular content of protective enzymes can provide a means of limiting biological damage caused by free radicals. Liposomal entrapment and intracellular delivery of superoxide dismutase to cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells increased the specific activity of cellular superoxide dismutase 6 to 12-fold. This augmented superoxide dismutase activity persisted in cultured endothelial cell monolayers and rendered these cells resistant to oxygen-induced injury. Culture of confluent endothelial cells in hyperoxia increased 51Cr and lactate dehydrogenase release in an oxygen concentration-dependent manner. Superoxide dismutase-augmented endothelial cells were resistant to oxygen damage compared to untreated controls, in a superoxide dismutase concentration-dependent manner. Free superoxide dismutase in the absence or presence of liposomes containing no enzyme had no effect on cellular enzyme activity and did not protect from oxygen damage. Liposomes made from saturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids had a small but significant protective effect on oxygen-induced cell damage. These liposomes probably increased endothelial cell membrane saturated lipid content and thereby decreased peroxidative damage when the cells were exposed to hyperoxia. Conversely, preincubation of cells with arachidonic acid increased cell arachidonic acid content, sensitivity to hyperoxia, and hyperoxia-induced production of thiobarbituric acid material. These data suggest that intracellular delivery of superoxide dismutase prevents oxygen-induced cell damage and that superoxide is an important mediator of cellular oxygen toxicity.

4007180|a|Increased cellular generation of partially reduced species of oxygen mediates the toxicity of hyperoxia to cultured endothelial cells and rats exposed to 95-100% oxygen. Liposomal entrapment and intracellular delivery of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells increased the specific activity of cellular SOD up to 15-fold. The liposome-mediated augmentation of SOD activity persisted in cell monolayers and rendered these cells resistant to oxygen-induced injury in a cell SOD activity-dependent manner. Addition of free SOD to culture medium had no effect on cell SOD activity or resistance to oxygen toxicity. SOD and catalase-containing liposomes injected i.v. into rats increased lung-associated enzyme specific activities two- to fourfold. Liposome entrapment of both SOD and catalase significantly increased the circulating half-lives of these enzymes and was critical for prevention of in vivo oxygen toxicity. Free SOD and catalase injected i.v. in the absence or presence of control liposomes did not increase corresponding lung enzyme activities or survival time in 100% oxygen. These studies show that O2- and H2O2 are important mediators of oxygen toxicity and that intracellular delivery of oxygen protective enzymes can reduce tissue injury owing to overproduction of partially reduced oxygen species.

We hypothesized that erythrocyte catalase might function to protect heterologous somatic cells against challenge by high levels of exogenous H2O2 (e.g., in areas of inflammation). We find that, whereas nucleated cells (L1210 murine leukemia) are readily killed by an enzymatically generated flux of superoxide (and, therefore, H2O2), the addition of human and murine erythrocytes blocks lethal damage to the target cells. Inhibition of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, depletion of glutathione, and lysis of the erythrocytes do not diminish this protection. However, inhibition of erythrocyte catalase abrogates the protective effect and the addition of purified catalase (but not superoxide dismutase) restores it. Furthermore, erythrocytes derived from congenitally hypocatalasemic mice (in which other antioxidant systems are intact) do not protect L1210 cells. Our results raise the possibility that the erythrocyte may serve as protection against by-products of its own cargo, oxygen.

2982213|a|Intact erythrocytes placed into the tracheobronchial tree of hyperoxic rats dramatically improved their chances for survival. Over 70 percent of the animals so treated survived more than 12 days during continuous exposure to 95 percent oxygen, whereas all of the control animals died within 96 hours. Lungs from erythrocyte-protected rats showed almost none of the morphologic damage suffered by untreated animals. Erythrocytes containing cyanomethemoglobin were as beneficial as normal erythrocytes, but cells in which glutathione was partially blocked were significantly less protective. Analogous results were obtained in vitro: 51Cr-labeled target cells released 70 to 90 percent of their label when exposed briefly to hydrogen peroxide or to toxic oxygen species generated by phorbol ester-stimulated neutrophils. Addition of intact erythrocytes decreased release by approximately 75 percent, but significantly less than this if red blood cell glutathione was partially blocked. These results suggest that insufflated erythrocytes, through their recyclable glutathione, protect rats from toxic oxygen species engendered by hyperoxia.

293671|a|Extracts of bovine hypothalamus were found to contain a significant level of mitogenic activity when tested in a Swiss 3T3 cell [3H]dThd incorporation assay and in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell growth assay. The mitogenic activity responsible for 3T3 cell activity was purified and characterized as a fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-like mitogen. Neither the biologically active FGF-like mitogen purified from the hypothalamus extracts nor FGF purified from bovine pituitary glands was mitogenic when added to human endothelial cells in vitro, suggesting the presence of more than one mitogen in the hypothalamic extracts. The 3T3 and endothelial cell biological activities of hypothalamic extracts were both found to be inactivated by trypsin, subtilisin, and heat treatment, but were stable to dialysis. The endothelial cell growth factor activity could be efficiently separated from the FGF activity by gel exclusion chromatography. The endothelial cell mitogen possessed a molecular weight of approximately 75,000, whereas that of FGF was approximately 15,000. The endothelial cell growth factor activity was found to be inactivated with reducing agents whereas the 3T3 cell mitogenic activity was stable after incubation with 2-mercaptoethanol. Significant levels of endothelial cell mitogenic activity were also found in extracts of bovine brain and pituitary glands.

3734101|a|Bovine microvascular endothelial cells (MEC) were able to degrade the H2O2 generated by phorbol myristate acetate-activated bovine neutrophils or by glucose oxidase with a maximal capacity of 4.0 +/- 1.2 (SD) nmol/10(6) cells/min, corresponding to the H2O2 released by about 3 X 10(6) neutrophils. H2O2 degradation occurred via the glutathione redox cycle and catalase. Degradation via the glutathione redox cycle was coupled with a marked stimulation of the hexose monophosphate shunt activity. The effect of H2O2 on ethidium bromide exclusion and on succinate oxidation was studied. Neither parameter was altered when MEC were exposed to H2O2 produced at rates within their degradative capacity. As soon as this was exceeded, impairment of both functions occurred. It is concluded that endothelial cells can protect themselves from H2O2-induced injury in a well-defined range of environmental H2O2 concentrations by actively degrading the peroxide.

3771800|a|The damage to pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells that occurs in many inflammatory conditions is thought to be caused in part by phagocytic neutrophils. To investigate this process, we exposed monolayers of purified rat alveolar epithelial cells to stimulated human neutrophils and measured cytotoxicity using a 51Cr-release assay. We found that stimulated neutrophils killed epithelial cells by a process that did not require neutrophil-generated reactive oxygen metabolites. Pretreatment of neutrophils with an antibody (anti-Mo1) that reduced neutrophil adherence to epithelial cells limited killing. Although a variety of serine protease inhibitors partially inhibited cytotoxicity, we found that neutrophil cytoplasts, neutrophil lysates, neutrophil-conditioned medium, purified azurophilic or specific granule contents, and purified human neutrophil elastase did not duplicate the injury. We conclude that stimulated neutrophils can kill alveolar epithelial cells in an oxygen metabolite-independent manner. Tight adherence of stimulated neutrophils to epithelial cell monolayers appears to promote epithelial cell killing.

An in vitro model system was used in the studies: vascular smooth muscle or endothelial cells grown on plastic surface were treated with specific mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing an antigen localized on the surface of smooth muscle rather than endothelial cells; then erythrocytes coated with secondary (rabbit antimouse) antibodies were added. The results were analyzed spectrophotometrically or with scanning electron microscopy. Under the experimental conditions, erythrocytes, possible 'containers' for carrying the drugs, were found to bind only to smooth muscle cells. The data show that antibody provides absolute discrimination between endothelial and smooth muscle cells and, thus, may be used as a vector for drug targeting.

6090809|a|Acute glomerular injury in the rat has been induced by the intrarenal, intraarterial infusion of sheep antibody to glomerular basement membrane (antiglomerular basement membrane). The antiglomerular basement membrane antibody has been verified to be of the variety that is complement and neutrophil dependent for the induction of acute proteinuria, which peaks during the first 24 hours. Following injection of the antibody, acute, intense, glomerular injury resulted, with the denuding of glomerular vascular basement membrane associated with extensive damage or destruction of glomerular endothelial cells and fusion of epithelial cell foot processes. Treatment of animals with catalase produced, in a dose-dependent manner, as much as 75% protection against glomerular injury, as assessed by reduction in the proteinuria. Treatment of animals with superoxide dismutase caused a small reduction in the degree of glomerular injury, again assessed by a reduction in proteinuria. However, this protective effect of superoxide dismutase was not found to be statistically significant. The hydroxyl radical scavenger, dimethyl sulfoxide, which has been shown to protect against endothelial cell injury following systemic activation of complement, was not protective in the anti-GBM model. Morphologically, glomeruli from catalase-protected rats showed numerous neutrophils but little or no evidence of injury of either glomerular endothelial or epithelial cells. These data suggest that acute glomerular injury produced by antiglomerular basement membrane is related to H2O2 production from activated neutrophils.

6233906|a|Previously it was shown that tissue injury occurring in acute immune-complex-induced vasculitis, which is complement and neutrophil-dependent, is significantly attenuated by the presence of catalase, suggesting the pathogenic role of H2O2 generated from activated neutrophils. We now show that significant protection is also afforded by pretreatment of animals with apolactoferrin , a naturally occurring chelator of iron. Iron-saturated lactoferrin is devoid of protective effects. Deferoxamine mesylate, a synthetic iron chelator, also has protective effects. Infusion of ionic iron, especially Fe(III), potentiates the tissue injury. Significant protection from tissue injury is also produced by treatment of rats with dimethyl sulfoxide, a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger. Morphologically, animals treated with these protective interventions show the influx of neutrophils into sites of immune complex deposition, but there is markedly attenuated edema, little or no hemorrhage, and little evidence of endothelial cell injury, in contrast to the findings in nonprotected animals. These data support the suggestion that immune-complex-induced injury may be linked to generation of H2O2 from activated neutrophils and the subsequent conversion of H2O2 to the hydroxyl radical.

6707200|a|We have examined the role of the glutathione redox cycle as an antioxidant defense mechanism in cultured bovine and human endothelial cells by disrupting the glutathione redox cycle at several points. Endothelial glutathione reductase was selectively inhibited with 1,3-bis(chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). Cellular stores of reduced glutathione were depleted by reaction with diethylmaleate (DEM) or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) or by inhibition of glutathione synthesis with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Whereas several strains of untreated bovine and human endothelial cells were resistant to lysis by enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide, BCNU-treated cells were readily lysed in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Glucose-glucose oxidase-mediated lysis of BCNU-treated bovine endothelial cells was catalase-inhibitable and directly related to BCNU concentration and endogenous glutathione reductase activity. Pretreatment of bovine endothelial cells with BCNU did not potentiate lysis by distilled water, calcium ionophore, lipopolysaccharide, or hypochlorous acid. Depletion of cellular reduced glutathione by reaction with DEM or CDNB or by inhibition of glutathione synthesis by BSO also potentiated endothelial lysis by enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide. Inhibition of endothelial glutathione reductase by BCNU or depletion of reduced glutathione by BSO increased endothelial susceptibility to lysis by hydrogen peroxide generated by phorbol myristate acetate-activated neutrophils. We conclude that the glutathione redox cycle plays an important role as an endogenous antioxidant defense mechanism in cultured endothelial cells.

2985221|a|Recent work suggests that oxygen radicals may be important mediators of damage in a wide variety of pathologic conditions. In this review we consider the evidence supporting the participation of oxygen radicals in the adult respiratory distress syndrome, in ischemia reperfusion injury in the myocardium, and in cerebral vascular injury in acute hypertension and traumatic brain injury. In the adult respiratory distress syndrome there is active sequestration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the pulmonary vascular system. There is evidence that activation of these neutrophils results in the production of oxygen radicals which injure the capillary membrane and increase permeability, leading to progressive hypoxia and decreased lung compliance which are hallmarks of the syndrome. In acute arterial hypertension or experimental brain injury oxygen radicals are important mediators of vascular damage. The metabolism of arachidonic acid is the source of oxygen free radical production in these conditions. In myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury, the ischemic myocyte is "primed" for free radical production. With reperfusion and reintroduction of molecular oxygen there is a burst of oxygen radical production resulting in extensive tissue destruction. Myocardial ischemia--reperfusion injury shares in common with the other two syndromes activation of the arachidonic acid cascade and acute inflammation. Thus it would appear that the generation of toxic oxygen species may represent a final common pathway of tissue destruction in several pathophysiologic states.

4031060|a|Previously we have demonstrated that systemic activation of the complement system after intravenous injection of cobra venom factor (CVF) results in acute lung injury as reflected by increases in the vascular permeability of the lung as well as by morphologic evidence of damage to lung vascular endothelial cells. In using the vascular permeability of the lung as the reference, the current studies show a quantitative correlation between lung injury and the appearance in plasma of lipid peroxidation products (conjugated dienes) as well as increased concentrations of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and one of its isoenzymes (LDH-4). After injection of CVF, extracts of lungs also showed elevated levels of conjugated dienes, whereas no elevations were found in extracts of liver, kidney, and spleen. There was no evidence in CVF-injected rats of renal or hepatic injury as reflected by the lack of development of proteinuria and the failure to detect increased serum levels of liver-related enzymes. Other peroxidation products identified in plasma of CVF-injected rats involved hydroperoxides and fluorescent compounds with features of Schiff bases. Not surprisingly, malondialdehyde was not found to be a reliable plasma indicator of lipid peroxidation associated with oxygen radical-mediated lung vascular injury. In using a model of oxygen radical-independent lung injury induced by oleic acid, although large amounts of LDH and LDH-4 were found in the plasma, no increases in plasma levels of conjugated dienes were detected. In CVF-injected animals treated with interventions protective against lung injury (neutrophil depletion, catalase, hydroxyl radical scavengers, or iron chelators), there were striking reductions in the plasma levels of conjugated dienes, hydroperoxides, and fluorochromic products. Morphometric analysis of lung sections revealed that the protective interventions did not interfere with the accumulation of neutrophils in lung interstitial capillaries after systemic activation of complement. In vitro studies with phorbol-stimulated neutrophils failed to demonstrate appearance of conjugated dienes, suggesting that the dienes appearing in plasma of CVF-injected animals are not the result of autotoxic changes in neutrophils. The data presented in this paper suggest that acute lung injury mediated by oxygen radicals derived from phagocytic cells can be monitored by the appearance in plasma of products of lipid peroxidation.

6358213|a|We have covalently attached a monoclonal antibody (11-4.1) against the murine major histocompatibility antigen, H-2Kk, on the surface of liposomes. The interaction of these antibody-coated liposomes (immunoliposomes) with target cells, RDM-4 lymphoma (H-2Kk), was investigated. About 90% of the immunoliposomes taken up by target cells at 4 degrees C could be removed by a mild protease treatment of the cells, whereas only 30% of the uptake at 37 degrees C was labile to the same treatment. Furthermore, the uptake of immunoliposomes at 37 degrees C was inhibitable by cytochalasin B or by a combination of 2-deoxyglucose and NaN3. These results suggest that immunoliposome binding to the target cell surface is the primary uptake event at 4 degrees C and that the surface-bound liposomes are rapidly internalized by the cells at 37 degrees C, probably via an endocytic pathway. Studies with fluorescence microscopy of target cells treated with immunoliposomes containing carboxyfluorescein also supported this conclusion. If endocytosis is the mechanism by which immunoliposomes gain entry into target cells, the efficacy of a cytotoxic drug encapsulated would depend on the resistance of the drug to lysosomal inactivation and its ability to escape from the lysosomal system. Consistent with this notion, we observed that methotrexate encapsulated in liposomes bearing 11-4.1 antibody specifically inhibited deoxy[6-3H]uridine incorporation into DNA in target RDM-4 cells but not in P3-X63-Ag8 myeloma cells (H-2Kd) at the same doses. The observed cytotoxic effect of encapsulated methotrexate could be reversed by the treatment of cells with a lysosomotropic amine, chloroquine, which has been shown to increase the intralysosomal pH of mammalian cells. On the other hand, cytosine-beta-D-arabinofuranoside encapsulated in immunoliposomes showed no target-specific killing, probably because the drug is readily inactivated in the lysosomal system. These results are discussed in terms of the drug carrier potential of immunoliposomes.

3865221|a|We have examined the interaction of freshly isolated human blood monocytes with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. Purified monocytes incubated with confluent primary or passaged endothelial cells (EC) for 90 min at 37 degrees C bound at maximal densities of 6.5-7.0 X 10(3)/mm2 (8 or 9 per EC) without causing disruption of the monolayer. Monocyte-EC binding proceeded in the presence of plasma proteins or optimal phagocytic doses of opsonized zymosan particles. The avidity of attachment was not diminished by alternative monocyte isolation techniques. Monocyte attachment to EC was dependent upon the presence of divalent cations (magnesium greater than calcium) and was inhibited at 4 degrees C. Monocytes selectively bound to EC when incubated with monolayers composed of smooth muscle cells and EC. Neither EC monolayer confluence nor a variety of EC culture conditions affected the high levels of monocyte binding. In contrast, human neutrophils (less than 1 per EC) and lymphocytes (less than 2-3.5 per EC) bound at lower maximal densities under the same conditions, while platelet reactivity remained minimal. The distinctively higher affinity of human blood monocytes relative to other circulating white cells for binding to cultured human EC may have relevance to their function in vivo.

2981472|a|Fluorescent molecular probes were used for study of the interaction between enteroviruses (Echo 9, Echo 12, and Coxsackie B3 virus) and human endothelial cells in monolayer culture. With the use of the monomer-excimer method with pyrene decanoic acid it was shown that a marked dose-dependent restructuring of the plasma membrane occurred following addition of virus to the endothelial cells. This took the form of an increase in the lipid surface available to the lipophil reporter molecules, probably due to an alteration in the domain structure of the plasma membrane caused by insertion of virus capsid proteins. Experiments with diphenylhexatriene indicated that the enteroviruses had only a slight tendency to make the plasma membrane of the endothelial cell more fluid. Concomitant with these alterations in the biophysical properties of the membrane, a virus-induced increase in granulocyte adherence to the endothelial cells was observed for all three enteroviruses studied. Possible mechanisms for this elevated adherence are discussed, as well as the significance of the results for the phenomenon of virus-induced granulocytopenia.

7054233|a|The mechanism by which immune complexes deposit in vascular tissue is uncertain. Several human viruses, including herpes simplex virus, have recently been demonstrated to replicate in human endothelial cells. Such viruses may injure vascular tissue and could play a role in the pathogenesis of immune complex deposition. Therefore, we studied the expression of receptors for immune complexes containing IgG and C3 on endothelial cells after infection with herpes simplex virus type I.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated with (51)Cr-labeled sheep erythrocytes sensitized with IgG, IgM, or IgM plus complement. Preferential binding of IgG or complement-coated erythrocytes to uninfected endothelial monolayers was not observed. In contrast, significant binding of erythrocytes coated with IgG or IgM plus complement was observed after viral infection. Phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated erythrocyte adherence around the infected endothelial cells in a rosette pattern. Binding of IgG-coated erythrocytes was fully inhibited by Fc (0.31 mg/ml) but not Fab' fragments of nonimmune IgG. Binding of complement-coated cells was unaffected by the presence of IgG (1 mg/ml). With purified individual components, binding of complement-coated erythrocytes depended on the presence and was proportional to the concentration of C3. Binding of IgG-or C3-coated cells was detected beginning 4 h after infection. These studies indicate that herpes simplex virus type I infection can induce IgG and C3 receptors on human endothelial cells. These receptors may promote the deposition of immune complexes in vascular tissue after certain viral infections.

2988666|a|Adherence of neutrophils to glomerular basement membrane containing immunoglobulin G aggregates was accompanied by a marked increase in oxygen uptake (eightfold). Very little of the O2 consumed was recovered as superoxide, measured by cytochrome c reduction, or as H2O2, measured with horseradish peroxidase and scopoletin. When neutrophils were incubated with the basement membrane preparation in the presence of cerium chloride to detect H2O2, electron micrographs showed cerium perhydroxide deposits in the contact area between the cells and the basement membrane, but not on the remainder of the cell surface. The results imply that superoxide is produced only where the plasma membrane is in contact with the basement membrane matrix, and that it mostly breaks down to H2O2 or undergoes other reactions at this site. The longer lifetime of H2O2 compared with that of superoxide allows some of the H2O2 produced to be detected in the medium. The results also suggest that the area of contact between the neutrophil and surfaces such as basement membrane is inaccessible to proteins in the medium, eg, cytochrome c. Circulating scavengers such as superoxide dismutase or catalase, or proteolytic inhibitors, may therefore be unable to control events occurring at this site.

Although formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)-activated neutrophils failed to induce 51Cr-release or detachment after 4 hours of incubation with endothelial monolayers cultured in polystyrene wells, FMLP-activated neutrophils produced a marked increase in the passage of 125I-albumin across bovine aortic or pulmonary artery endothelial monolayers on polycarbonate filters. This effect was evident as early as 30 minutes following the addition of FMLP-activated neutrophils to the monolayer and reached 180% over control values at 2 hours (p = 0.001). Light and transmission electron microscopic examination of the polycarbonate filters exposed to FMLP-activated neutrophils revealed focal disruption of the endothelial monolayers. Chronic granulomatous disease neutrophils produced similar disruption of the endothelial monolayer at 2 hours. Moreover, catalase and superoxide dismutase failed to reduce significantly the neutrophil-mediated increase in 125I-albumin passage at 2 hours. Cell-free postsecretory supernatants of FMLP-activated neutrophils, leukotriene C4, and platelet activating factor did not induce a significant increase in 125I-albumin passage across the endothelial monolayers. Of note, FMLP-activated neutrophils from a patient with a congenital abnormality of neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis did not induce disruption of the monolayer or increase 125I-albumin passage. We conclude that activated neutrophils mediate rapid, nonlytic disruption of endothelial monolayer integrity by an oxygen radical-independent mechanism that requires neutrophil-endothelial contact.

6751091|a|Data from two short-term double-masked studies using 24 and 16 subjects suggest that topically applied levobunolol safely and effectively treats open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The onset of effect of a single drop of 0.5% levobunolol occurred within the first hour, producing a maximal hypotensive effect of more than 8 mm Hg after two hours. An intraocular pressure deceased of greater than or equal to 2 mm Hg was still observed after 24 hours for both concentrations of levobunolol tested (0.5% and 1%). Intraocular pressure decreases of more than 9 mm Hg persisted during a one-month trial in which patients were treated twice daily, confirming the results obtained in the 24-hour study. Systemic effects of both timolol (0.5%) and levobunolol (0.5% and 1%) included a consensual intraocular pressure-decreasing effect in the untreated eye and clinically significant reductions in heart rate. Diastolic blood pressure was decreased at two and four hours after administration of 0.5% levobunolol.

6337497|a|We conducted a randomized, double-masked, dose-response study of the ocular hypotensive effect of the beta-adrenergic blocker, levobunolol. A single drop of placebo or levobunolol (at concentrations of 0.03%, 0.3%, 0.6%, 1%, and 2%) was administered to one eye of each of 48 patients with ocular hypertension. The 0.3% and 0.6% concentrations decreased intraocular pressure significantly from baseline levels compared to placebo at one, two, and four hours after treatment. The 1% and 2% concentrations decreased intraocular pressure significantly from baseline compared to placebo at one, two, four, six, eight, and 12 hours after administration. No objective or subjective side effects were noted, and no substantial changes in visual acuity, pupil diameter, pulse rate, or blood pressure were recorded during the study. These results appear to justify long-term studies of levobunolol for the treatment of increased intraocular pressure.

7006575|a|The clinical courses of 41 patients who received timolol maleate for experimental protocols were reviewed. We reevaluated the conditions of 17 patients with the elevated pressures of primary open angle glaucoma who had received timolol alone or in combination with other glaucoma medications for a maximum of 35 months (average, 26 months). Withdrawal of timolol led to an average intraocular pressure rise of 5 mm Hg. Eight patients treated with timolol alone showed a progressive, significant, 3-mm Hg upward rise, or "long-term drift" in IOP during the follow-up period. Pressure rise after timolol withdrawal, however, was not significantly less than pressure reduction when timolol was initiated. At least two weeks are required for "washout" or disappearance of timolol effect after timolol is withdrawn, and re-treatment for one week restores IOP to prewithdrawal levels.

6933241|a|In previous reports concerning cancer among Seventh-Day Adventists (SDA), comparisons were made only with the general population. This report compared California SDA to a sample of non-SDA who were demographically similar to SDA. The study consisted of 17 years of follow-up (1960--76) on 22,940 white California SDA and 13 years of follow-up (1960--72) on 112,725 white California non-SDA. Both groups completed the same base-line questionnaire in 1960. Deaths were ascertained by annual contacts with each study member and by computer-assisted record linkage with the California State death certificate file. Results indicated that, with the exception of colon-rectal cancer and smoking-related cancers, the difference in risk of fatal cancer between SDA and non-SDA was substantially reduced when SDA were compared with a more socioeconomically similar population. The persistence of the low risk for colon-rectal cancer can probably be attributed to some aspect of the diet or life-style of the SDA.

707372|a|Seventh-Day Adventists (SDAs) are a conservative religious denomination who abstain from tobacco and alcohol; approximately one-half follow a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet. In this 6-year prospective study of 24,044 California SDAs age 35 and over, coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rates for ages 35 to 64 and 65+ are 28% and 50% respectively, of the rates for the same age groups of the total California population. This reduced risk of CHD mortality among SDAs is partially due to abstinence from smoking; however, at least half the low risk among SDAs is likely attributable to other characteristics of the SDA lifestyle. The risk of fatal CHD among nonvegetarian SDA males, ages 35 to 64, is three times greater than vegetarian SDA males of comparable age (P less than 0.01), suggesting that the SDA diet may account for a large share of their low risk. This differential was much smaller for older SDA males and SDA females. Although the differential in risk of fatal CHD for male nonvegetarians versus vegetarians may be partially accounted for by other CHD risk factors, which are more frequent among nonvegetarians, a significant differential persists after adjustment for each of six other CHD risk factors.

6527990|a|In 1960 the meat-consumption habits of 25,153 California Seventh-Day Adventists were assessed by questionnaire. Between 1960 and 1980 ischemic heart disease deaths were identified. Meat consumption was positively associated with fatal ischemic heart disease in both men and women. This association was apparently not due to confounding by eggs, dairy products, obesity, marital status, or cigarette smoking. The positive association between meat consumption and fatal ischemic heart disease was stronger in men than in women and, overall, strongest in young men. For 45- to 64-year-old men, there was approximately a threefold difference in risk between men who ate meat daily and those who did not eat meat. This is the first study to clearly show a dose-response relationship between meat consumption and ischemic heart disease risk.

6342357|a|In the present study we examined the effect of coingestion of 50 g fat (butter) on the postprandial glucose, insulin, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide responses to 50 g carbohydrate (potato) or 50 g protein (low fat veal) in eight normal subjects. The coingestion of fat with either carbohydrate or protein resulted in greatly increased gastric inhibitory polypeptide responses, the effect being more pronounced with carbohydrate. The addition of fat to a carbohydrate meal also reduced the postprandial glucose response. This could have been due to several factors including a delayed glucose absorption, secondary to a fat-induced inhibition of gastric emptying. However, despite the lower blood glucose levels in the presence of fat the insulin response was not reduced, suggesting a potentiation of insulin secretion in the presence of fat. Thus, despite the apparent improvement in glucose tolerance when carbohydrate is ingested together with fat, the accompanying potentiation of insulin secretion could form the basis of long-term changes in insulin sensitivity which accompany alterations in dietary fat intake.

6127504|a|There is circumstantial evidence of a causal connection between type 1 diabetes in young Icelandic males and consumption of smoked cured mutton, containing N-nitroso compounds, by their parents at about the time of conception. This hypothesis has been examined in CD1 mice, and such processed mutton, consumed by the parents before mating and during pregnancy and by the offspring from day 19 until study 1-5 weeks later, produced diabetes in just over 16% of male progeny and 4.2% of female progeny. Light and electron-microscopic changes in the beta-cells were those of stages of cell death. The parent mice showed no features of diabetes. When both parents were fed the Icelandic cured mutton only up to the time of fertilisation, there was first a fall and then a significant rise in the plasma glucose of the male progeny after the 3rd week of age. The female progeny showed a significant fall in plasma glucose at 5-6 weeks of age. These findings suggest that an environmental factor in the aetiology of human diabetes mellitus had been identified. The mechanism seems to involve parental as well as maternal influences of germ cells.

729433|a|High-carbohydrate, high-fiber (HCF) diets have beneficial therapeutic effects for selected patients with diabetes mellitus. We have treated 10 patients with HCF diets on a metabolic ward and followed them for an average of 15 months while they were on maintenance diets at home. The HCF diets containing 70 per cent of calories as carbohydrate were accompanied by significant reductions in requirements for insulin or sulfonylureas. Fasting plasma glucose, serum cholesterol, and triglyceride values were significantly lower on the HCF diet than on a 43 per cent carbohydrate diet. On the HCF diet, insulin therapy was discontinued for five patients and sulfonylurea therapy for three. After an average of 15 months on the maintenance diet containing 55 per cent to 60 per cent carbohydrate, seven patients were still managed without insulin or sulfonylureas. Average fasting plasma glucose values during maintenance diets at home were identical to values on the HCF diets in the hospital. On the maintenance diet, serum cholesterol values were similar to initial values but serum triglyceride values were significantly lower than values on the 43 per cent carbohydrate diet. These studies indicate that moderately high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diets can be successfully followed at home and that improvements in glucose metabolism achieved in the hospital can be sustained outside the hospital.

16656611|a|Biogenesis of mitochondria occurs in the germinating cotyledons of peanuts. This process was demonstrated by measuring both constitutive and enzymatic properties of mitochondria as a function of germination time. Direct counting by phase contrast microscopy of sucrose density gradient preparations showed that the number of mitochondria increased markedly during germination. DNA with a buoyant density distinct from the major cellular DNA was associated with these mitochondrial preparations. During germination the amount of this DNA in mitochondrial pellets increased. This increase closely paralleled the increase in number of mitochondria.Succinoxidase and succinic dehydrogenase increased during germination. Both activities were confined to the mitochondrial fraction. The rate of increase of succinoxidase activity was significantly greater than the rate of increase of succinic dehydrogenase and both increased at least initially at a greater rate than the amount of mitochondrial DNA or numbers of mitochondria.The amounts of cytochromes present in mitochondrial preparations were measured spectrophotometrically. All of the cytochromes increased in amount during germination. The rate of increase of cytochrome a - a(3) very close to the rate of increase in succinoxidase activity.

These are: mitochondria (density 1.19 g/cc), proplastids (density 1.23 g/cc) and glyoxysomes (density 1.25 g/cc). Further evidence is provided on the enzymatic composition of the glyoxysomes. Essentially all of the particulate malate synthetase, isocitrate lyase, catalase, and glycolic oxidase is present in these organelles. The distribution of glyoxysomal enzymes on sucrose density gradients is contrasted with that of the strictly mitochondrial enzymes fumarase, NADH oxidase, and succinoxidase. Malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthetase are present in both organelles. The functional role of glyoxysomes and their relationship to cytosomes from other tissues is discussed.

16656822|a|Germination of peanut seed is accompanied by a rapid increase in isocitritase (isocitrate lyase, EC 4.1.3.1) during the first 4 days. The presence of cycloheximide (50 mug/ml) during water imbibition inhibited the increase in isocitritase activity. Actinomycin D conversely did not inhibit isocitritase activity until the second day of imbibition while RNA synthesis was inhibited. Germination of peanut seed in (14)C-reconstituted amino acids followed by fractionation of a 20 to 35% ammonium sulfate preparation on a Sephadex G-200 column (57-fold purification) showed that the active enzymic fraction coincided with a large peak of radioactivity. Germination of peanut seed in 45% D(2)O followed by enzyme purification and CsCl equilibrium centrifugation revealed that all the enzyme from D(2)O seed had a higher density than normal isocitritase. These data indicate that isocitritase in peanut seed is synthesized de novo.

16656823|a|Evidence for de novo synthesis of isocitratase and malate synthetase in cotyledons of germinating peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) was obtained by the density labeling method. When dry peanut cotyledons were cultured in H(2) (18)O, a 2.4% increase in the buoyant density of malate synthetase in a cesium chloride gradient was observed. In 100% D(2)O the buoyant density shift was 5.5% for isocitratase and 3.5% for malate synthetase in comparison to the water controls. These data suggest that isocitratase and malate synthetase do not pre-exist in some inactive form in the cotyledons, but are completely synthesized after onset of germination from a pool of amino acids which do not derive directly from hydrolysis of storage proteins.

Fraction 2 requires 3 to 4 days for maximum production, is dependent on heme synthesis, and probably has its origin in the bone marrow, as a degradation product of red-cell heme.

The phage patterns of 64 of 89 cultures isolated from the food-poisoning samples placed them in the miscellaneous phage group (44A) or in phage group IV and the miscellaneous group (42D/44A); 14 had phage patterns that involved group III, the group with which food poisoning has usually been associated. In contrast, over 50% of 104 cultures from the market cheese, which were typed at 100 times the critical test dilution, had phage patterns that involved group III.

The method depends upon annealing poly(adenylic acid)-rich mRNA to oligothymidylic acid-cellulose columns and its elution with buffers of low ionic strength. Biologically active rabbit globin mRNA has been purified by this procedure and assayed for its ability to direct the synthesis of rabbit globin in a cell-free extract of ascites tumor. Inasmuch as various mammalian mRNAs appear to be rich in poly(adenylic acid) and can likely be translated in the ascites cell-free extract, this approach should prove generally useful as an initial step in the isolation of specific mRNAs.

6255214|a|Supercoiled DNA molecules were used for the molecular cloning of full-length avian sarcoma virus (ASV) DNA. Viral DNA produced by the Schmidt-Ruppin A (SR-A) strain of ASV was isolated from acutely infected transformed quail cells. Supercoiled DNA was separated from linear and open circular DNA by acid phenol extraction, opened into a full-length linear form by cleavage with the restriction endonuclease SacI, and cloned into lambda gtWES x lambda B. Four different cloned viral DNA molecules were isolated: SRA-1 contains two copies of the 330-base pair terminal redundancy normally found at each end of the linear DNA molecules, but harbors a 63-base pair deletion that spans the site at which the two copies of the terminal redundancy are joined in circular DNA molecules; SRA-2 contains two complete copies of the terminal redundancy; SRA-3 probably contains only one copy of the terminal redundancy but in all other respects appears to be similar to SRA-2; SRA-4 contains a 2,500-base pair deletion that removes all of the src gene (the gene responsible for transformation by ASVs) plus additional nucleotides adjacent to the src gene whose precise locations have not been determined. Transfection of chicken embryo fibroblasts by either SRA-1 or SRA-2 resulted both in the appearance of transformed cells and in the production of infectious virus. These results demonstrate that the cloned DNA molecules are functionally identical to viral DNA produced in vivo; therefore, molecular cloning did not cause any major alterations of the DNA. The infectivity of SRA-1 DNA indicates that the 63 base pairs missing from that molecule are not required for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis, even though the deletion is located in a copy of the terminal redundancy thought to carry a promoter for RNA synthesis. This suggests that the deletion does not remove any sequences required for the initiation of transcription.

198585|a|Viral complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences corresponding to the gag, pol, env, src, and c regions of the Rous sarcoma virus genome were selected by hybridizing viral cDNA to RNA from viruses that lack the env or src gene or to polyadenylic acid [poly(A)]-containing RNA fragments of different lengths and isolating either hybridized or unhybridized DNA. The specificities, genetic complexities, and map locations of the selected cDNA's were shown to be in good agreement with the size and map locations of the corresponding viral genes. Analyses of virus-specific RNA, using the specific cDNA's as molecular probes, demonstrated that oncovirus-infected cells contained genome-length (30-40S) RNA plus either one or two species of subgenome-length viral RNA. The size and genetic content of these RNAs varied, depending on the genetic makeup of the infecting virus, but in each case the smaller RNAs contained only sequences located near the 3' end of the viral genome. Three RNA species were detected in Schmidt-Ruppin Rous sarcoma virus-infected cells: 39S (genome-length) RNA; 28S RNA, with an apparent sequence of env-src-c-poly(A); and 21S RNA, with an apparent sequence of src-c-poly(A). Cells infected with the Bryan high-titer strain of Rous sarcoma virus, which lacks the env gene, contained genome-length (35S) RNA and 21S src-specific RNA, but not the 28S RNA species. Leukosis virus-infected cells contained two detectable RNA species: 35S (genome-length) RNA and 21S RNA, with apparent sequence env-c-poly(A). Since gag and pol sequences were detected only in genome-length RNAs, it seems likely that the full-length transcripts function as mRNA for these two genes. The 28S and 21S RNAs could be the active messengers for the env and src genes. Analyses of sequence homologies among nucleic acids of different avian oncoviruses demonstrated substantial similarities within most of the genetic regions of these viruses. However, the "common" region of Rous-associated virus-0, an endogenous virus, was found to differ significantly from that of the other viruses tested.

4357873|a|A colony of transformed cells was isolated from chick-embryo cells infected with a stock of nondefective Schmidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma virus. The virus recovered from this colony was a stable defective mutant very similar to the Bryan strain of Rous sarcoma virus in the following characteristics: (i) noninfectiousness of virus particles released from transformed cells that lack helper factor; (ii) formation of infectious pseudotypes by coinfection with avian leukosis virus or by interaction with endogenous-helper factor in chicken cells; (iii) ability of the noninfectious form of virus to transform chick-embryo cells in the presence of ultraviolet light-inactivated Sendai virus; (iv) absence of glycoprotein in the noninfectious form; (v) failure to produce nondefective virus by recombination with avian leukosis virus; and (vi) segregation of polymerase-negative virus. The morphology of transformed cells is characteristic of those infected by the Schmidt-Ruppin strain. The demonstration of segregation of such a defective virus from nondefective sarcoma virus and failure to detect revertants of this mutant suggest that the deletion of some genes may be involved in this mutation.

60496|a|Cells doubly infected with two mutants of the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), ts68, which is temperature sensitive for cell transformation (srcts), and a deletion mutant, N8, which is deficient in the envelope glycoprotein (env-), produced a recombinant which carried the defects of both parents. The frequency of formation of such a recombinant was exceptionally high and made up 45 to 55% of the progeny carrying the srcts marker. By contrast, the reciprocal recombinant, which is wild type in transformation (srcts) and contains the subgroup A envelope glycoprotein (envA), was almost undetectable. This remarkable difference in the frequency of the formation of the two possible recombinants suggests that a unique mechanism may be involved in the genetic interaction of the two virus genomes, one of which has a large deletion. When an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase-negative variant of the N8 (N8alpha) was crinants also became deficient in the polymerase. Cells infected by the srctsenv- recombinant were morphologically normal at the nonpermissive temperature (41 degrees C) and susceptible to all subgroups of RSV. The rate by which the wild-type RSV transformed the recombinant-preinfected cells was indistinguishable from that of transformation of uninfected chicken cells by the same wild-type virus. This indicates that no detectable interference exists at postpenetration stages between the preinfected and superinfecting virus genomes and confirms that the expression of the transformed state is dominant over the suppressed state.

6328034|a|A mutant derived from a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus ( tsNY68 ) which showed extremely low infectivity was characterized. Infection of chicken embryo fibroblast cells with the mutant, TK15 , induced two types of transformants, mutant-producing 15c (+) and nonvirus -producing 15c (-) transformants. 15c (+) cells expressed all four viral genes normally and produced a normal level of virus particles. No complementation was observed between the mutant and avian leukosis viruses. However, when 15c (+) cells were cocultured with nonvirus -producing cells transformed by Y73, a replication-defective avian sarcoma virus, a high titer of Y73 virus was recovered. From its biological properties, the mutant seemed to have a defect(s) outside the viral genes. Biochemical analysis of the TK15 mutant (T. Koyama , F. Harada, and S. Kawai , J. Virol. 51:154-162, 1984) revealed that it had a defect in packaging its own genomic RNA. During replication of TK15 virus, the TK15 mutant appeared to segregate at high frequency more defective variants that induced 15c (-) transformants, in most of which only the src gene was expressed. The mechanism for the segregation of 15c (-) transformants is discussed with respect to the defect of the mutant.

219227|a|The 4S RNA contained in RNA tumor virus particles consists of a selected population of host tRNA's. However, the mechanism by which virions select host tRNA's has not been elucidated. We have considered a model which specifies that 35S genomic RNA determines which tRNA's are to be encapsidated as well as the relative amounts of these tRNA's within the virion. The model was tested by comparing the free 4S RNA composition of normal murine leukemia virus (MuLV) particles and noninfectious virions from actinomycin D (ActD)-treated cells, which are deficient in genomic RNA (ActD virions). Viral 4S RNA was analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Surprisingly, the patterns obtained for control and ActD 4S RNA were identical to each other and were clearly distinct from the cell 4S RNA pattern. The viral patterns had three prominent areas of radioactivity. One of the spots was identified on the basis of its oligonucleotide fingerprint as tRNA (Pro), the primer for MuLV RNA-directed DNA synthesis. These results were obtained with two different MuLV strains, AKR and Moloney, each grown in SC-1 cells. The demonstration that ActD virions contain primer tRNA and in general exhibit the characteristic MuLV tRNA pattern rather than the complete representation of cell 4S RNA leads to the conclusion that genomic RNA is not the major determinant in selective packaging of host tRNA's. A possible role for one or more viral proteins, including reverse transcriptase, is suggested.

83199|a|We have isolated a nonconditional mutant of PR-RSV-E with unique properties. This virus (SE 21Q1b) is shed from a continuously growing culture of transformed quail cells. 21Q1b virions are unable to transform or replicate in other quail or chicken cells after exogenous infection, despite the fact that the viral particles contain normal envelope glycoproteins, internal structural proteins and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The lack of infectivity of 21Q1b virions is a consequence of the failure to package genomic 39S RNA. Instead, these virions contain a mixture of heterogenous-sized polyadenylated cellular RNAs and 4S RNA. Less than 1% of the encapsulated RNA is viral-specific, although in the 21Q1b-producing cells, amounts of 39S, 28S and 21S viral RNAs comparable to those in wild-type virus-infected cells are synthesized and function as mRNAs for the viral proteins. Thus 21Q1b can be considered an RNA packaging mutant. Superinfection of 21Q1b cells with either RAV-1 or PR-A leads to production of about 10% or more of the normal titer of superinfecting virus, but none of the 21Q1b genetic markers are rescued. After superinfection, the 21Q1b cells continue to synthesize 21Q1b particles containing cellular RNAs in the same amounts as before infection. Thus superinfection does not appear to "switch off" the aberrant packaging of cellular RNA, but allows packaging of the superinfecting RNA. One explanation for the phenotype of 21Q1b is that the genome is lacking a signal necessary for efficient genomic RNA packaging (but not for translation) and that the 21Q1b genome encodes a "packaging factor" with an altered specificity so that cellular RNAs are efficiently packaged. 21Q1b virions do contain RNA-dependent DNA polymerase which has normal endogenous synthetic activity. The cDNA product made in vitro from detergent-lysed 21Q1b virions hybridizes equally well to uninfected quail and 21Q1b-producing quail cell RNAs, with kinetics suggesting that the endogenous product consists of transcripts of cellular RNAs present in low amounts in the cells.

6678608|a|A mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), pMOV-psi-, was constructed by deletion of about 350 nucleotides from an infectious proviral DNA clone between the putative env mRNA 5' splice site and the AUG that initiates the coding sequence for Pr65gag. Although the parent wild-type proviral clone, pMOV-psi+, quickly causes a high level of reverse-transcriptase-containing virus particles to be released from transfected NIH/3T3 cells, transfection of pMOV-psi- into these cells initially results in very little release. By 9 to 10 days after transfection, however, pMOV-psi- -transfected cells produce infectious virus. Thus pMOV-psi- has a defect that can be repaired in transfected NIH/3T3 cells, presumably by recombination with a sequence normally present in the cells. Cell lines with pMOV-psi- stably integrated into chromosomal DNA produce reverse-transcriptase-containing particles that lack detectable M-MuLV RNA but the cells efficiently complement replication-defective, packagable retroviruses. Thus pMOV-psi- has a defect in the packaging of genomic RNA into virions but can provide in trans the products necessary for virion production. The deletion in pMOV-psi- appears to define a site required in cis for packaging of MuLV RNA into virions. Cell lines carrying pMOV-psi- can be used to produce helper-free stocks of natural or synthetic defective retroviruses.

6162035|a|Mutants of avian sarcoma virus which lack a functional DNA polymerase were found to be nonselective in the incorporation of host cell tRNA's into virus particles. In contrast, mutants which possess a functional DNA polymerase but lack the viral genome RNA contained a specific subset of the host cell tRNA population, indistinguishable from that of the wild-type virus. Thus the reverse transcriptase, and not the viral RNA, is probably the major factor determining which tRNA's are incorporated into avian sarcoma virus particles. Supporting evidence was obtained in an in vitro binding assay between purified reverse transcriptase and unfractionated cellular tRNA's. However, the subset of tRNA's which associated with the genome in the 70S complex was determined primarily by the viral RNA. In the absence of DNA polymerase, the 70S RNA complex in mature virus particles contained the normal complement of associated tRNA's with the exception of tRNATrp, the primer for RNA-directed DNA synthesis.

6310871|a|Two assays have been utilized to assess the ability of avian retroviral molecules to be packaged into virus particles. Cloned viral genomic molecules were microinjected into the nuclei of chick cells infected by either a lymphoid leukosis virus or an envelope glycoprotein-deficient sarcoma virus. The titer of focus-forming virus released by injected cells, or the ratio of these to helper virus, is then used to determine packaging efficiency, although biological properties other than packaging might also effect these assays. With either assay, deletions up to 3.0 kbp introduced in the viral gag or pol genes did not affect packaging unless sequences near the SstII restriction site (approximately 150 bp 3' of the splice donor site) were deleted. Deletions differing by 2 bp at the SstII site were found to express radically different packaging efficiencies.

Most of the 4S RNAs are present at an average of less than one copy per virion. The 4S RNAs have T1 RNase (EC 2.7.7.26) fingerprints, which are very similar to those of tRNAs. One of the smallest 4S RNAs, which can act as a primer for initiation of RNA-directed DNA synthesis, is associated with the 70S RNA in 1 to 2 copies per complex, whereas an additional 6 to 8 copies of this molecule are free.

87521|a|The small RNAs contained in virions of avian leukosis and sarcoma viruses are a virus-specific subset of the total small RNA population of the host cell. The reverse transcriptase protein must be present in the budding virion for this selection to take place. Virions of the alpha form of the Bryan strain of Rous sarcoma virus, which lack detectable reverse transcriptase, incorporated an unselected population of small RNAs identical to total chicken cell small RNA. Virions of reticuloendotheliosis virus, which contain a reverse transcriptase unrelated to that of the avian leukosis and sarcoma viruses, contained a distinctly different population of small RNAs although both the avian leukosis and sarcoma and the reticuloendotheliosis viruses were grown in chicken cells. Because the primer for avian leukosis and sarcoma virus RNA-dependent DNA synthesis is a host cell tRNA, the differences in reverse transcriptase small RNA selection may help explain the failure of different species of retrovirus to complement for the reverse transcriptase.

6253670|a|We have previously described a nonconditional mutant of avian sarcoma virus (SE21Q1b) which fails to package viral RNA (Gallis et al., Virology 94:146-161, 1979; Linial et al., Cell 15:1371-1381, 1978). Quail cells transformed by SE21Q1b contain normal amounts of intracellular viral mRNA's for src, env, and gag-pol and release particles with the density of normal virus containing a typical complement of virion proteins, including reverse transcriptase. These virions are noninfectious for both chicken and quail cells and contain primarily cellular rather than viral RNA. Analysis by gel electrophoresis of the cellular DNA of quail cells transformed by SE21Q1b after restriction endonuclease digestion indicated the presence of a single provirus. The provirus was located at one site in the genome of the host cell and was flanked by the characteristic terminally repeated sequences derived from the 3' and 5' ends of viral RNA. The only defect detected in the SE21Q1b provirus was a deletion of ca. 150 base pairs of DNA somewhere between 300 and 600 bases from the left (gag-pol) end of the provirus. Analyses of the proviral DNA of cells transformed by wild-type recombinants between SE21Q1b and leukosis viruses reveal that the recombinants no longer contain this deletion. The deletion, therefore, defines a region on the viral RNA which is required for correct packaging of the virion RNA.

6159983|a|When mRNA for avian retroviral envolope glycoprotein (env) was injected into cells transformed by env-deficient Bryan Rous sarcoma virus, the env deficiency of the injected cells was complemented to allow the release of transforming virus for up to 40 hr. When virus spread within the injected culture was allowed to occur, a second phase of transforming virus production by the injected culture began approximately 2 days following injection, continued for many days and often increased to titers well above those seen soon after injection. The requirement for virus spread, along with the genetic properties of virus released long after injection, supported the hypothesis that the second phase of virus production resulted when injected env mRNA was packaged into virus released by injected cells. When this virus infected other cells within the culture the env mRNA was reverse-transcribed to form a subgenomic, proviral-like molecule able to direct the synthesis of env mRNA. Accordingly, it was shown tht neither DNA nor full genomic viral RNA contaminating injected mRNA preparations could account for the results. Evidence that an mRNA can be reverse-transcribed into an active, proviral-like molecule may be of importance in the relationship between retroviruses and their hosts.

6264426|a|We have determined the nucleotide sequence of portions of two circular avian sarcoma virus (ASV) DNA molecules cloned in a prokaryotic host--vector system. The region whose sequence was determined represents the circle junction site--i.e., the site at which the ends of the unintegrated linear DNA are fused to form circular DNA. The sequence from one cloned molecule, SRA-2, shows that the circle junction site is the center of a 330-base-pair (bp) tandem direct repeat, presumably representing the fusion of the long terminal repeat (LTR) units known to be present at the ends of the linear DNA. The circle junction site is also the center of a 15-bp imperfect inverted repeat, which thus appears at the boundaries of the LTR. The structure of ASV DNA--unique coding region flanked by a direct repeat that is, in turn, terminated with a short inverted repeat--is very similar to the structure of certain transposable elements. Several features of the sequence imply that circularization to form the SRA-2 molecule occurred without loss of information from the linear DNA precursor. Circularization of another cloned viral DNA molecule, SRA-1, probably occurred by a different mechanism. The circle junction site of the SRA-1 molecule has a 63-bp deletion, which may have arisen by a mechanism that is analogous to the integration of viral DNA into the host genome. Flanking one side of the tandem direct repeat is the binding site for tRNATrp, the previously described primer for synthesis of the first strand of viral DNA. The other side of the direct repeat is flanked by a polypurine tract, A-G-G-G-A-G-G-G-G-G-A, which may represent the position of the primer for synthesis of the second strand of viral DNA. An A+T-rich region, upstream from the RNA capping site, and the sequence A-A-T-A-A-A are present within the direct repeat sequence. These sequences may serve as a promoter site and poly(A) addition signal, respectively, as proposed for other eukaryotic transcription units.

The results (i) locate the initiation codon for the gag gene of Rous sarcoma virus 372 nucleotides from the 5' end of viral RNA; (ii) demonstrate that this codon is preceded by three methionine codons that are apparently not used in translation; (iii) sustain previous conclusions that the principal site to which ribosomes bind on the Rous sarcoma virus genome in vitro does not contain the initiation codon for gag; (iv) permit deduction of the amino acid sequence of a viral structural protein, p19; (v) confirm the amino-terminal sequence of Pr76gag; and (vi) substantiate the identification of a splice donor site described in the accompanying manuscript (Hackett et al., J.

6159641|a|A simple and rapid method for transferring RNA from agarose gels to nitrocellulose paper for blot hybridization has been developed. Poly(A)+ and ribosomal RNAs transfer efficiently to nitrocellulose paper in high salt (3 M NaCl/0.3 M trisodium citrate) after denaturation with glyoxal and 50% (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide. RNA also binds to nitrocellulose after treatment with methylmercuric hydroxide. The method is sensitive: about 50 pg of specific mRNA per band is readily detectable after hybridization with high specific activity probes (10(8) cpm/microgram). The RNA is stably bound to the nitrocellulose paper by this procedure, allowing removal of the hybridized probes and rehybridization of the RNA blots without loss of sensitivity. The use of nitrocellulose paper for the analysis of RNA by blot hybridization has several advantages over the use of activated paper (diazobenzyloxymethyl-paper). The method is simple, inexpensive, reproducible, and sensitive. In addition, denaturation of DNA with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide promotes transfer and retention of small DNAs (100 nucleotides and larger) to nitrocellulose paper. A related method is also described for dotting RNA and DNA directly onto nitrocellulose paper treated with a high concentration of salt; under these conditions denatured DNA of less than 200 nucleotides is retained and hybridizes efficiently.

6178841|a|Envelope glycoprotein (env) mRNA from avian retroviruses was injected into cells transformed by env-deleted Bryan Rous sarcoma virus [RSV(-)]. The genetic deficiency of RSV(-) was complemented, and infectious transforming virus was released for many days after these injections. The long-term activity of the injected env mRNA is believed to be due to reverse transcription of the injected RNA after its incorporation into virus particles. The resulting subgenomic provirus, presumed to be integrated into host DNA, is able to direct the continuous synthesis of additional env mRNA. In some of these cultures, replication-competent viruses appeared many days after injection. The analysis by RNase T1 oligonucleotide fingerprinting showed that the RNA of these virus genomes contained oligonucleotides characteristic of both RSV(-) and the env mRNA injected. In all viruses analyzed the 5' two-thirds and the 3' terminus of the genome were derived from RSV(-) and the env gene from the injected mRNA. Our results thus strongly indicate that these viruses were generated via recombination between RSV(-) and env mRNA. The demonstration of involvement of an mRNA sequence in recombination may be of importance in the divergence of retroviruses and in the mechanism of interaction between retroviruses and host nucleotide sequences.

874640|a|Paraquat was administered to rats by gavage or intravenously at doses which were approximately equitoxic (680 mu. moles/kh and 65 mu. moles/kg respectively) and the lungs examined by light and electron microscopy at intervals up to 48 hours. No significant changes were observed in alveolar endothelial cells at any of the time intervals studied. After intravenous administration the first ultrastructural changes were observed at 4 hr in the type I cells which were less electron dense and contained few organelles. At 8 hr these lesions were more marked and in some places the basement memebrane was denuded. Type II cells were also showing damage to mitochondria and loss of microvilli. After oral dosing, the type and sequence of changes was similar but the first changes were not seen until 22 hr. Intravenous injection of 0-03 micron carbon particles 1 hr before killing showed no significant leakage from the alveolar endothelium. This study provides no morphological evidence that the oedema of the lung caused by paraquat in rats is due to damage to endothelial cells. It appears that, following dosing by the two routes, the difference in interval between dosing and the development of lesions is due to the accumulation of paraquat. Lesions in type I cells therefore occurred when a certain concentration of paraquat is known to be present in the lung. It is suggested that a prime compartment into which paraquat is accumulated is the alveolar epithelial cell.

582275|a|BALB/c mice were exposed to an aerosol of paraquat dichloride solution and were killed six hours, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days later. Initial necrosis and sloughing of the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelia with intact endothelium were followed by type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and increased synthesis of collagen. These results indicate that inhaled paraquat solution produces pulmonary fibrosis that is morphologically similar to the lesions produced by systemic administration.

4141224|a|Administration of 0.5 mg bleomycin to mice twice weekly for 4 weeks induced pulmonary fibrosis. The initial site of injury was the intima of pulmonary arteries and veins where endothelial cells became edematous and were separated from the underlying basement membrane by large blebs. These lesions occurred after 2 weeks and were associated with infiltration of perivascular spaces by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Capillary endothelial blebbing and interstitial edema were observed after 4 weeks, when multifocal necrosis of type 1 alveolar epithelial cells was accompanied by fibrinous exudation into the alveoli. The process of repair was characterized by proliferation and metaplasia of type 2 epithelial cells, fibroblastic organization of alveolar fibrin and fibrosis of the interstitium within 8 to 12 weeks. The consistent induction of changes similar to those of diffuse pulmonary fibrosis or fibrosing alveolitis in man suggests that bleomycin-induced injury may provide a suitable model for the investigation of this ill-defined group of diseases.

830993|a|Butylated hydroxytoluene, a common food additive, is known to produce proliferative pulmonary changes characterized by increased DNA, RNA, and lung weight. In the present study, reactive hyperplasia and fibrosis were produced within 9 days after a single intraperitoneal injection of 400 mg. per kg. of butylated hydroxytoluene was given to mice. Initial perivascular edema with cell infiltrates was followed by necrosis of type 1 alveolar epithelial cells and by division of type 2 cells which repopulated the alveolar wall with unusually large epithelial cells containing abundant cytoplasm. DNA synthesis, as indexed by thymidine and uridine kinase levels and by 3H-thymidine uptake, increased at 2 days, peaked at 4 days, and dropped gradually to near normal by day 9. Differential counts of labeled cells revealed that the early rise was due to epithelial cell proliferation; in turn, interstitial and endothelial cells entered the proliferative phase. Endothelial labeling peaked at day 6 immediately following ultrastructural evidence of endothelial injury. It is concluded that the proliferative pulmonary changes that occur after the administration of butylated hydroxytoluene are a consequence of cell injury and necrosis. The reparative processes occur predominantly at the alveolar epithelium and interstitium with the production of fibrosis. The cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia observed in this study account for the biochemical changes in pulmonary RNA and DNA that have been described previously.

4386931|a|1. Paraquat and diquat produce only a slight increase in the oxygen uptake of rat liver mitochondria, and it is likely that they do not penetrate the mitochondrial membrane. 2. In mitochondrial fragments inhibited by antimycin A or by Amytal, both substances stimulate oxygen uptake with NADH or beta-hydroxybutyrate as substrate but not with succinate. The NADH dehydrogenase of the respiratory chain appears to be involved, at a site only partially inhibited by Amytal. 3. An NADPH oxidase activity is stimulated in rat liver microsomes by diquat, and to a smaller extent by paraquat; diquat also causes an NADH oxidase activity to develop. The effect is not inhibited by carbon monoxide or p-chloromercuribenzoate, and it is probable that a flavoprotein is involved by a mechanism not requiring thiol groups. 4. One molecule of oxygen can oxidize two molecules of NADPH in the stimulated microsomal system, the hydrogen peroxide produced being broken down by a catalase activity in the microsomes. 5. Diquat can stimulate NADH oxidase and NADPH oxidase activity in the postmicrosomal soluble fraction; the enzyme involved may be DT-diaphorase. 6. The mechanism of these reactions and their significance in relation to the toxicity of the dipyridilium compounds are discussed.

27101|a|Isolated perfused rat lungs were used to investigate effects of paraquat on lung glucose metabolism. Lungs were ventilated with 5% CO2 in air and perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, containing albumin and 5.5 mM radiolabeled D-glucose. Control lung glucose utilization, estimated from rate of 3H2O production from [5-3H]glucose, was 44 mumol/h-g dry wt. Pentose cycle activity, based on 14CO2 specific yields at the end of perfusions with [1-14C]- and [6-14C]glucose, was 14% of glucose utilization. During perfusion with 1.5 mM paraquat, glucose utilization increased 28%, 14CO2 production via the pentose cycle increased 182% (P less than 0.005), CO2 production via mitochondrial metabolism increased 39% (P less than 0.02), and the rate of lactate production increased 28% (P less than 0.05). Pyruvate production and the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio were not significantly altered. The data indicate that interaction of paraquat with the lung results in increased turnover of cytoplasmic NADPH and increased mitochondrial metabolism, but no significant change in cytoplasmic redox state. The findings are compatible with intracellular enzymatic reduction of paraquat by an NADPH-requiring reductase.

227855|a|Paraquat mediates a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c by suspensions of Escherichia coli B. Glucose was most effective in providing electrons for this cytochrome c reduction, but other nutrients could serve in this capacity, provided the cells were preconditioned by growth on these nutrients. Paraquat reduction depended upon a NADPH:paraquat diaphorase, present in the cytosol. Reduced paraquat could diffuse across the cell envelope and react with dioxygen, in the suspending medium, thus generating O2- in that compartment. Most of the paraquat reduced in the cell, under the conditions used, reoxidized in situ and most of the O2- production was thus intracellular. The partitioning of reduced paraquat between intracellular and extracellular compartments, prior to reaction with dioxygen, depended upon intracellular pO2 and any strategy which raised intracellular pO2 decreased the efflux of reduced paraquat and thus decreased extracellular O2- production. Extracellular O2- and H2O2 did contribute to cell damage in proportion to the amount produced. O2- appeared to be unable to cross the cell envelope in either direction and the only O2- which was effective in raising the rate of biosynthesis of the manganese-superoxide dismutase, was that generated within the cell.

540539|a|Hyperoxia has been shown to enhance the toxicity of the herbicide paraquat. Experiments were conducted to learn more about the effects of oxygen following acute poisoning with paraquat as well as the structurally related herbicide, diquat. Rats were injected intravenously with various doses of diquat or paraquat and placed into an atmosphere of either 100% oxygen or room air. The time required for 50% lethality (LT50) of both diquat and paraquat was greatly diminished by hyperoxia and was dependent upon the herbicide dosage. Rats treated with 40 or 80 mg/kg diquat and exposed to 100% oxygen had a shorter LT50 than those treated similarly with paraquat. A dose of 20 mg/kg was equitoxic in 100% oxygen while rats treated with 5 or 10 mg/kg diquat had a longer LT50 than rats treated with the same dose of paraquat. All animals exhibited severe respiratory distress terminally. The plasma concentrations and tissue distribution of either herbicide at 20 mg/kg were the same in oxygen and air exposed animals. When oxygen concentrations were varied between 100% and 60% rats treated with 20 mg/kg diquat or paraquat exhibited increasing but equal LT50's. In 40% oxygen diquat treated rats died more rapidly than paraquat treated rats. These data demonstrate a toxic interaction between hyperoxia and diquat as well as paraquat.

The effect persisted for a time period of at least 24 h. Exposure to 100% oxygen enhanced the toxicity of both compounds without substantially amplifying changes in the NADPH/NADP ratio. Lungs retained the capability to synthesize adenine nucleotides de novo. Electron microscopic studies showed that both paraquat and diquat damage type I alveolar cells, but only paraquat produces type II cell lesions. Although bipyridylium herbicides produce acute oxidation of NADPH in vivo, there seems not to exist a straightforward relationship between this event and cell damage.

994461|a|Ingestion or injection of the herbicide paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-dipyridylium dichloride) has caused more than 120 deaths in humans. Most have been due to respiratory failure caused by pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and atelectasis, or subsequent pulmonary fibrosis. Paraquat is concentrated in lung tissue and is believed to cause superoxide radical formation in the presence of oxygen and suitable electron donors. Exposure to increased concentrations of oxygen has been reported to accelerate the toxicity of paraquat. The therapeutic efficacy of a reduced oxygen environment was investigated by exposing paraquat-poisoned mice to 10% oxygen after stepwise drops from 14% oxygen. Sixty-one mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 27 mg. per kg. of paraquat. The 25 mice in hypoxia for 7 days had a 32% mortality rate versus a 78% mortality rate for the remainder of the mice in room air, p less than 0.01. After a dose of 20 mg. per kg. of paraquat administered intraperitoneally, 24 mice in hypoxia had a 25% mortality rate versus 51% for 35 animals in room air. Brief exposures of the hypoxic group to "normoxia" (room air) led to pulmonary edema and death. The continuous exposure of paraquat-poisoned animals to hypoxic environments was protective. This approach may be useful in other oxidant lung injuries.

169247|a|Evidence for the formation of singlet oxygen during the oxidation of NADPH by liver microsomes is presented. The evidence is based primarily on the enzyme-dependent formation of dibenzoylethylene from diphenylfuran, a reaction which is specific for singlet oxygen. The apparent formation of singlet oxygen is coupled to the occurrence of peroxidation of microsomal lipid, a phenomenon known to be associated with NADPH oxidation by the particles. Both the peroxidation of lipid and the apparent formation of singlet oxygen are related to the amount of Fe3+ present in the system and the results are consistent with the possibility that the singlet oxygen formed by this system is derived from the breakdown of lipid peroxides. If 1O2 is formed from breakdown of lipid peroxides, it would be dependent on O-/-2 formation because superoxide anion has been shown to undergo reactions in this system which generate extremely reactive free radicals (probably hydroxyl) that initiate lipid peroxidation. These peroxides are quite unstable and their degradation may be the source of 1O2. We have consistently observed that O-/-2 itself is not a reactive radical with respect to lipids or radical scavengers. Hence, O-/-2 cannot be the radical which initiates lipid peroxidation on which 1O2 generation appears to depend. The results may offer at least part of the explanation for the dietary requirement for alpha-tocopherol which not only scavenges free radicals but quenches singlet oxygen as well. This report also includes description of studies indicating that another enzyme, xanthine oxidase, which forms superoxide anion during its activity under aerobic conditions, does not form singlet oxygen during its function. This finding is in contrast to reports of others which indicate that xanthine oxidase activity does produce 1O2.

7082349|a|In vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the capacity of the redox cycling compounds mitomycin C (MC), nitrofurantoin (NF) and paraquat (PQ) to stimulate pulmonary microsomal lipid peroxidation. It was observed that the interaction of MC, NF or PQ with rat or mouse lung microsomes in the presence of an NADPH-generating system and an O2 atmosphere resulted in significant lipid peroxidation. All three compounds demonstrated similar concentration dependency, similar time courses and the ability to generate lipid peroxidation-associated chemiluminescence. The stimulation of lipid peroxidation by MC, NF or PQ was inhibited significantly by superoxide dismutase, glutathione, ascorbic acid, catalase and EDTA, agents which either scavenge reactive oxygen and/or prevent the generation of secondary reactive oxygen metabolites. In addition, the ability of MC or NF, but not PQ, to stimulate lipid peroxidation was reduced significantly following preincubation with microsomes and NADPH under N2 (15-20 min) prior to incubation under O2. During this period under N2. MC and NF underwent reductive metabolism of their quinone and nitro moieties respectively. Thus, it appears that under aerobic conditions the pulmonary microsomal-mediated redox cycling of MC, NF and PQ is accompanied by the stimulation of reactive oxygen-dependent lipid peroxidation.

7364936|a|Paraquat and diquat facilitate formation of superoxide anion in biological systems, and lipid peroxidation has been postulated to be their mechanism of toxicity. Paraquat has been shown to be more toxic to selenium-deficient mice than to controls, presumably as the result of decreased activity of the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase. The present study was designed to measure lipid peroxidation and to assess toxicity in control and selenium-deficient rats given paraquat and diquat. Lipid peroxidation was measured by determining ethane production rates of intact animals; toxicity was assessed by survival and by histological and serum enzyme evidence of liver and kidney necrosis. Paraquat and diquat were both much more toxic to selenium-deficient rats than to control rats. Diquat (19.5 mumol/kg) caused rapid and massive liver and kidney necrosis and very high ethane production rates in selenium-deficient rats. The effect of paraquat (78 mumol/kg) was similar to that of diquat but was not as severe. Acutely lethal doses of paraquat (390 mumol/kg) and diquat (230 mumol/kg) in control rats caused very little ethane production and no evidence of liver necrosis. These findings suggest that paraquat and diquat exert their acute toxicity largely through lipid peroxidation in selenium-deficient rats. Selenium deficiency had no effect on superoxide dismutase activity in erythrocytes or in 105,000 g supernate of liver or kidney. Glutathione peroxidase, which represents the only well-characterized biochemical function of selenium in animals, was dissociated from the protective effect of selenium against diquat-induced lipid peroxidation and toxicity by a time-course study in which selenium-deficient rats were injected with 50 mug of selenium and later given diquat (19.5 mumol/kg). Within 10 h, the selenium injection provided significant protection against diquat-induced lipid peroxidation and mortality even though this treatment resulted in no rise in glutathione peroxidase activity of liver, kidney, lung, or plasma at 10 h. This suggests that a selenium-dependent factor in addition to glutathione peroxidase exists that protects against lipid peroxidation.

877407|a|Aspirin (ASA), indomethacin (IND), hydrocortisone (HYC) or 0.25% agar (control) were administered (p.o.) daily to rats for 5 days. Following drug pretreatments, the activities of cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GP) and glutathione reductase (GR) were elevated 30-70%, 5-25% and 8-25%, respectively. In a second experiment, rats pretreated as above were injected (ip) on the 5th day with paraquat (PQ) (29 mg/kg). Rats in each group expired more ethane 2 hours after PQ injection. After 22 hours, expired ethane returned to zero time levels. All control rats died within 48 hours after PQ injection. At the end of 48 hours, rats pretreated with ASA, IND, or HYC demonstrated survival rates of 13%, 31%, and 47%, respectively. PQ injection produces marked elevations of SOD (82%), GP (328%), and GR (36%) in the lungs of PQ-injected controls rats over non-PQ injected controls. Elevation of these enzymes were also noted in drug-treated rats after PQ injection but at values less than PQ-injected controls. Anti-inflammatory drugs were tested in rat liver homogenates for their ability to inhibit thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reactive product formation. Only the addition of HYC resulted in a decrease formation of TBA-reactive products. Thus in vitro studies suggest that the antiinflammatory drugs tested, other than HYC, may have other mechanisms of actions in addition to inhibition of lipid peroxides.

The rate of synthesis of collagen by lung minces from these and control rats was evaluated by measuring the rate of synthesis of hydroxyproline, a specific marker for collagen in lung. Synthesis was measured by incubating lung minces with radioactive proline for various amounts of time, after which proline specific activity and labeled hydroxyproline were determined. The size of the proline pool within the lung minces was significantly elevated in minces from rats that had been injected with paraquat, thus causing the specific activity of the [3H]proline precursor to be lower in these lungs than in those from control animals. Lung minces from rats administered paraquat made more collagen than did those from uninjected controls. The actual increase in rate of collagen synthesis correlated well with other independent estimates of paraquat-induced damage to the lungs.

236669|a|To learn whether surface force changes precede the appearance of lung edema during experimental intoxication due to paraquat, we studied rats for 1 day following injection of 27 mg/kg iv. By 24 h, surface-active material recovered by lung lavage was decreased 32 percent, and changes in lung microsections and recoil pressure at half-deflation suggested decreased alveolar stability. Despite a 25 percent loss in overall body weight, lung weight increased more than 7 percent and protein concentration in lung lavage fluid increased by 158 percent. Lung edema was demonstrated morphologically as early as we could detect changes in surfactant or lung mechanical properties. Metabolic studies with lung tissue slices incubated with 4.5 times 10-4 M paraquat showed a fourfold increase in 14CO2 formed from (1-14C) glucose, but no significant change in 14CO2 form (6-14C) glucose, suggesting increased utilization of the pentose pathway for oxidation of glucose. (1-14C) Acetate oxidation was impaired slightly, but incorporation into lipid was decreased by 70 percent. we conclude that paraquat intoxication in the rat is not a suitable model for studying uncomplicated perturbation of the surfactant system.

6807356|a|We have investigated the hypothesis that the formation of mixed disulphides between protein sulphydryl and glutathione may be responsible for controlling the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway and fatty acid synthesis in rat lung. Using lung slices, taken form rats 2 h after dosing with a range of concentrations (5-80 mg/kg) of the pulmonary toxin paraquat, the pentose phosphate pathway was found to be stimulated in direct proportion to a reduction in fatty acid synthesis. These effects were also linearly related to an increase in mixed (total) disulphide levels in the lung. This was quantitatively similar to an increase in mixed (glutathione) disulphides, although non-protein sulphydryl and oxidised glutathione levels remained normal. Thus, an early biochemical event in the mechanism of the paraquat toxicity in the lung involves an increased formation of mixed (glutathione) disulphides and simultaneous regulation of pentose phosphate pathway activity and fatty acid synthesis. These data support the concept that the formation of mixed disulphides of protein and glutathione is a mechanism for maintaining NADPH levels despite the 'redox' stress caused by the cyclical and NADPH dependent reduction and reoxidation of paraquat.

7092955|a|Paraquat (1 mM), when added to isolated haemoglobin-free perfused rat liver, leads to an increase of intracellular mixed disulphides from 1.3 mumole GSH equivalents per g wet weight in the controls to 2.5 mumole/g. This raises the proportion of mixed disulphides to total glutathione equivalents from about 0.2 at the beginning of the perfusion to about 0.4. The mixed disulphides are predominantly protein-bound, with low molecular weight compounds being quantitatively negligible. The content of intracellular glutathione disulphide (GSSG) is increased from 17 nmole/g in the controls to 38 nmole/g in the presence of paraquat. In addition, there is an increased rate of release of GSSG into the extracellular (biliary) space, reported previously. It is suggested that, in a reaction catalysed by thioltransferase(s), the rise in GSSG is correlated with the rise in mixed disulphides (reaction 1). Occupancy of potential cellular mixed disulphide sites is about 1/2 in the controls, and rises to about 2/3 in the presence of paraquat. THe ratio of cellular contents, NADPH/NADP+, is decreased from 5.1 in the controls to 2.3 in the presence of paraquat, while the sum of NADPH plus NADP+ remains unaltered. The perturbation in the glutathione status may be related to metabolic effects such as the stimulation of the pentose-phosphate pathway activity, and possibly also to the expression of toxic effects.

1097394|a|Trileucine is utilized as a source of leucine for growth of strains of Escherichia coli K-12 that are deficient in the oligopeptide transport system (Opp). Trithreonine is toxic to E. coli K-12. Opp- mutants of E. coli K-12 retain complete sensitivity to this tripeptide. Moreover, E. coli W, which is resistant to trithreonine, can utlize this tripeptide as a threonine source and this capability is fully maintained in E. coli W (Opp-). A spontaneous trithreonine-resistant mutant of E. coli K-12 (Opp-) has been isolated that has an impaired growth response to trileucine and is resistant to trithreonine. Trileucine competes with the uptake of trithreonine as measured by its ability to relieve trithreonine toxicity in E. coli K-12. It is concluded that trileucine as well as trithreonine are transported into E. coli K-12 or W by a common uptake system that is distinct from the Opp system. Trimethionine can act as a competitor of trileucine or trithreonine-supported growth and as an antagonist of trithreonine toxicity in Opp- mutants. It is concluded that trimethionine is recognized by the trileucine-trithreonine transport system. Trithreonine, trimethionine, and trileucine are also transported by the Opp system, as they all relieve triornithine toxicity towards E. coli W and compete with tetralysine utilization as lysine source for growth of a lysine auxotroph of this strain.

4278690|a|The transport system for glycylglycine in Escherichia coli behaves like a shock-sensitive transport system. The initial rate of transport is reduced 85% by subjecting whole cells to osmotic shock, and glycylglycine is not transported by membrane vesicles. The energetics of transport was studied with strain ML 308-225 and its mutant DL-54, which is deficient in Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-stimulated adenosine 5'-triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3) activity. It is concluded that active transport of glycylglycine, like other shock-sensitive transport systems, has an obligatory requirement for phosphate bond energy, but not for respiration or the energized state of the membrane. The major evidence for this conclusion is as follows. (i) Uptake of glycylglycine is severely inhibited by arsenate. (ii) Oxidizable energy sources such as d-lactate, succinate, and ascorbate, which is mediated by N-methylphenazinium methylsulfate, cannot serve as energy sources for the transport of glycylglycine in DL-54, which lacks oxidative phosphorylation. (iii) When energy is supplied only from adenosine-5'-triphosphate produced by glycolysis (anaerobic transport assays with glucose as the energy source in DL-54), substantial uptake of glycylglycine is observed. (iv) When the Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-adenosine triphosphatase activity is absent but substrate-level phosphorylations and electron transport are operating (glucose as the energy source in DL-54), transport of glycylglycine shows significant resistance to the uncouplers, dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone.

6296055|a|The uptake of peptides by Salmonella typhimurium is mediated by three apparently independent transport systems. One of these systems, the oligopeptide permease, is encoded by a genetic locus (opp) which has been mapped at 34 min on the S. typhimurium chromosomal map. We accurately mapped the location of opp by cotransduction frequencies and by deletion analysis and show that the gene order for this region of the chromosome is cysB-trp-tonB-opp-galU-tdk. All opp mutants, independently isolated by a variety of means, mapped at this one locus, between tonB and galU. Spontaneous and transposon Tn10-generated deletions were used to construct a fine-structure genetic map of opp. Evidence is presented which indicates that opp covers a 5- to 6-kb segment of DNA and is therefore likely to consist of more than one gene.

1097395|a|The ability of Escherichia coli K-12 4212 to utilize a variety of oligopeptides as sources of required amino acids was examined. Triornithine-resistant mutants of this strain were oligopeptide permease deficient (Opp-) as judged by their inability to utilize (Lys)3 and (Lys)4 as sources of lysine and their resistance to the toxic tripeptide (Val)3. These same mutants were able to grow when Met-Met-Met, Met-Gly-Met, Met-Gly-Gly, Gly-Met-Gly, Gly-Gly-Met, Gly-Met-Met, Met-Met-Gly, or Leu-Leu-Leu were supplied in place of the requisite amino acid. The system mediating the uptake of these peptides, herein designated Opr I, was not able to transport N-alpha-acetylated peptides, nor the tetrapeptides Met-Gly-Met-Met, Met-Met-Gly-Met, or Met-Met-Met-Gly. Competition experiments indicated that trimethionine and trileucine enter E. coli K-12 via either Opp or Opr I. Analogous results were found using the methionine, leucine-requiring auxotroph E. coli B163. It appears that more than one oligopeptide transport system exists in E. coli and that the system mediating peptide uptake is complex.

527869|a|Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is an uncommon condition of unknown aetiology. Bacterial gas production may be an important aetiological factor, but experimental evidence in humans has been lacking. We have studied breath hydrogen excretion as an index of bacterial gas production in 12 patients with PCI and have shown that four out of five with demonstrable cysts produced unusually high levels of hydrogen while fasting. This abnormality has not been previously reported. One patient showed resolution of PCI after antibiotic treatment. These findings confirm the importance of bacterial gas production in the pathogenesis of PCI.

414968|a|The (14)C-glycocholate test, including the measurement of marker corrected faecal (14)C, has been assessed in the following groups of subjects: normal controls (18), patients with diarrhoea not attributable to altered bile acid metabolism (21), patients with diverticula of the small intestine (12), patients with previous resection of ileum and often proximal colon (34), and established ileostomists (10). Patients with diverticular disease had increased breath (14)CO(2) excretion, but normal faecal excretion of (14)C, and this test was more frequently abnormal than the Schilling test. Ileostomists excreted increased amounts of faecal (14)C, even when the ileum was intact and apparently normal. The pattern after resection was complex. Breath (14)C output was normal if the ileal resection was less than 25 cm in length, although some of these patients had increased faecal (14)C excretion if, in addition, at least 15 cm of proximal colon had been resected or by-passed. Longer ileal resections were associated with increased breath and/or faecal (14)C excretion, depending in part on the length of colon resected or by-passed and the 24 hour faecal volume. Fewer than half these patients had both increased breath and faecal excretion of isotope and faecal (14)C alone was occasionally normal with an ileal resection of 50 cm of more. The (14)C-glycocholate test was more frequently abnormal than the Schilling test in this group. The use of faecal marker correction had only a minor impact on the results. These data suggest that, in patients with ileal resection, faecal (14)C, like faecal weight, is determined by the extent of colonic resection as well as by the amount of ileum resected.

7297914|a|A method is described for the measurement of hydrogen in expired air, using an electrochemical detector. The apparatus is simple to use and sensitive. Its application is illustrated by studies of small bowel transit time made by measuring the time between oral ingestion of the unabsorbable carbohydrate lactulose and a rise in the concentration of hydrogen in expired air. In 20 control subjects transit time was 93.0 +/- 6.6 minutes, while in 16 patients with diarrhoea due to the irritable bowel syndrome it was 54.1 +/- 6.3 minutes (P less than 0.001), suggesting an abnormality in small intestinal motility in these patients. Loperamide, a potent antidiarrhoeal agent, increased transit time in 12 of these patients from 56.3 +/- 6.7 to 100.0 +/- 10.2 minutes (P less than 0.001).

7439633|a|A method for measuring the transit time of a meal, containing sausages, mashed potato, baked beans, and a pineapple custard dessert, through the gastrointestinal tract was evaluated in 14 healthy volunteers. Gastric emptying was determined by incorporating a radioactive marker in the meal and counting over the surface of the stomach using a crystal scintillation detector. Small intestinal transit time was determined by measuring breath hydrogen excretion and by estimating the radioactivity over the cecum. Finally, whole gut transit time was measured by incorporating radiopaque plastic markers or carmine red in the meal and estimating the appearance of these markers in the stool. Our results showed that measurements of small intestinal transit time were reproducible and in the majority of subjects the increase in hydrogen excretion occurred at the same time as the increase in radioactive counts over the surface of the cecum. The passage of the first marker in the stool coincided with the appearance of carmine red. There were no significant correlations between small intestinal transit time and whole gut transit time or the half time for gastric emptying. Incorporation of 10, 25, and 40 g lactulose into our standard meal in place of sucrose increased the rate of transit through the small intestine but did not significantly alter the rate of gastric emptying or the whole gut transit time. Total stool weight for 48 hr after ingestion of the meal was inversely related to whole gut transit time but not to small intestinal transit time suggesting that the tendency to develop diarrhea in response to a meal containing unabsorbable carbohydrate depends more on the lack of colonic accommodation than on the rate of small intestinal transit. Finally, there was no significant correlation between the measurements of small intestinal transit time after a drink of lactulose and the transit time of a meal in the same subjects.

6840487|a|The effect of a gastrointestinal tube on the passage of a radiolabeled solid meal through the stomach and small intestine was investigated in 22 healthy volunteers using the gamma camera and breath hydrogen analysis. Gastric emptying was significantly retarded in 12 subjects, who had an intestinal tube in situ compared with 10 control subjects, who were not intubated (t 1/2 = 1.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.1 h; p less than 0.02). On the other hand, colonic filling was significantly accelerated in the intubated subjects (onset: 1.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.4 h; p less than 0.001; t 1/2: 4.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.5 h; p less than 0.001). Values for small bowel residence were significantly reduced in the intubated subjects (5.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.5 +/- 0.6 food hours; p less than 0.001). Paired studies, carried out in an additional 11 normal subjects, confirmed that small bowel transit time was significantly shortened during intestinal intubation in the same individuals (2.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.4 h). These results suggest that intubating the gastrointestinal tract may profoundly affect its function.

1120927|a|Pulmonary H2 excretion was used to quantitate the small bowel transit time in man. This technique is based on the observation that H2 is produced when carbohydrate is fermented by colonic bacteria and that this H2 production is reflected by a concomitant increase in breath H2 excretion. The time, therefore, between ingestion of the unabsorbable disaccharide, lactulose, and the rise in breath H2 represents the small intestinal transit time of the head of the lactulose load as it passes through the gut. Following ingestion of a mixture of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lactulose by 9 subjects, transit time measured by H2 excretion correlated closely with the simultaneously determined time for PEG to reach the distal ileum (r equals 0.97). The ileal appearance of PEG preceded the rise in H2 excretion by a mean of 7.6 minutes. Transit time of 19 Gm. of lactulose in 40 healthy subjects averaged 72 minutes (range 25 to 118). Studies repeated 3 to 5 times in 6 subjects showed good individual reproducibility with subsequent measurements differing from initial by a mean of plus or minus 14 per cent. There was an inverse relation between transit time and dose of lactulose ingested by 9 subjects with 5, 10 and 20 Gm. of lactulose having mean transit times of 128 plus or minus 19, 94 plus or minus 15, and 40 plus or minus 8 (S$M.) minutes, respectively. This technique appears to provide a simple, safe, and noninvasive means of studying small bowel transit time in man.

7084616|a|Hydrogen and methane in human breath derive entirely from bacterial fermentation in the intestinal lumen. The sources of substrates utilized for these reactions have not been completely determined. Basal excretion of both gases occurs in the fasted state, while malabsorbed carbohydrate commonly results in increased hydrogen but not methane production. Using an in vitro fecal incubation system, we have studied hydrogen and methane production from glycoproteins of endogenous as well as dietary origin. All glycoproteins tested yielded hydrogen when incubated with fecal homogenates. Mean hydrogen production from substrates containing less than 3% sugar (human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, and alpha-casein) averaged 2.2 +/- 0.9% of hydrogen production from equivalent amounts of glucose, while carbohydrate-rich mucin yielded 46.0 +/- 6.7% of hydrogen production from glucose. Glycoproteins of intermediate carbohydrate content, including transferrin and egg white, yielded intermediate values. Methane production from glycoproteins was optimal from carbohydrate-poor protein substrates in fecal homogenates which accumulated hydrogen and became rapidly acidic when incubated with pure carbohydrate. In contrast, methane production was comparable for essentially sugar-free proteins, glycoproteins, and glucose when hydrogen did not accumulate and neutral pH was maintained. We conclude that glycoproteins are substrates for hydrogen and methane production by colonic bacteria from healthy adults. In individuals with bacterial overgrowth syndromes and in protein-losing enteropathy, bacterial catabolism of endogenous glycoproteins may cause increased basal hydrogen and methane excretion. These findings also raise the possibility that measurement of hydrogen or methane after oral administration of dietary glycoproteins may be useful in detection of protein malabsorption.

6896018|a|Post-irradiation transplantation of normal thyroids under the renal capsule of syngenetic thymectomized and irradiated (Tx-X) rats leads to the development of thyroiditis in the ectopic grafted thyroids. A close correlation was observed between the extent of the lesions in the grafted and recipient's own thyroid. The histopathology of both grafted and recipient thyroid was similar and was characterized by infiltration with mononuclear cells together with some plasma cells. Conversely, grafting of affected thyroids from Tx-X rats to normal animals resulted in the regression of the lesion in the graft and no evidence thyroiditis was observed in either the graft or the recipient's thyroid when these were examined 60 days post-grafting. Thyroids derived from normal animals grafted to syngenetic normal rats were found to remain healthy and intact over a 60-day period. In contrast to normal animals, Tx-X rats were unable to reject totally in transplanted allogeneic thyroids by 28 days post-grafting, suggesting that some impairment of cell-mediated immunity follows this treatment. These findings indicate that the pathological change occurring in the thyroid gland of Tx-X rats is not attributable to the local effect of irradiation of the thyroids and adds further support to the concept that the process is immunologically mediated by thyroid-specific circulating components in the absence of normal immune regulatory function.

7039877|a|Immunoglobulin (Ig) secreting cells occur in all lymphoid tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). There are important differences between the various organs with respect to their number of Ig-secreting cells and the heavy chain isotype distribution of the secreted Igs. Furthermore, both distribution patterns depend on age. Early in life most Ig-secreting cells are localized in spleen and lymph nodes. In adults, however, the majority of all Ig-secreting cells of the individual are localized in the BM. Immunization can lead to the appearance of substantial numbers of antibody-forming cells in BM. The kinetics of the BM response are different from the response in the peripheral lymphoid tissues. Shortly after immunization most antibody-forming cells occur in the peripheral lymphoid tissues, but later on, especially during secondary type responses, most antibody-forming cells are localized in the BM. Apparently, antibody formation is regulated in such a way that peripheral lymphoid tissues respond rapidly, but only for a short period, whereas the BM response starts slowly, but takes care of a long-lasting massive production of antibodies to antigens which repeatedly challenge the organism.

4565839|a|With a modification of the Jerne plaque technique to enumerate plaque-forming cells (PFC) to bovine and rabbit thyroglobulin, the cellular kinetics of the antibody response were followed during two 5-day series of injections of an aqueous preparation of bovine thyroglobulin. The results support the suggestion that thyroiditis in the rabbit is mediated by antibody. The peak PFC appear in the spleen at the end of the second series of injections and are considerably greater for bovine than for rabbit thyroglobulin. PFC also appear in the thyroid gland; however, the numbers of PFC for bovine and rabbit thyroglobulin were similar, and they did not reach a peak until 7 days after the peak PFC in the spleen. There was an excellent correlation between the appearance of PFC in the thyroid gland and the appearance of thyroid lesions. The disappearance of antibody to rabbit thyroglobulin from the serum also correlated with the appearance of lesions. Migration inhibition factor (MIF) activity was not produced at any time throughout the study when rabbit thyroglobulin was added to peritoneal exudates of immunized rabbits containing circulating antibody to rabbit thyroglobulin.

6968214|a|By use of a hemolytic plaque assay, it has been determined that most cells secreting the clinically important (anti-X) erythrocyte autoantibody of NZB mice are located in the bone marrow. There was evidence of excessive polyclonal B cell activation in NZB spleen but not in bone marrow, despite the role of marrow as the major source of erythrocyte autoantibody. These findings suggest that polyclonal activation of B cells within the marrow does not lead to erythrocyte autoantibody production. Small but significant numbers of antierythrocyte autoantibody producing cells were detected in the bone marrow but not in the spleens of normal mice, indicating that tolerance to erythrocytes may be less absolute in the bone marrow than in the spleen, or that the bone marrow serves as a repository for autoantibody secreting cells generated elsewhere.

689074|a|Rat spleen cells are shown to be unresponsive to sheep red cells (SRBC) in vitro under conditions in which thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDL) respond very well. By adding unresponsive spleen cells to responsive TDL cultures, the spleen cells are shown to contain an inhibitor capable of preventing the response to SRBC. The inhibitory activity is a property of live cells; it is sensitive to radiation doses as low as 100 R x rays and to mitomycin C. It can be completely removed from spleen cell suspensions by extraction with large amounts of carbonyl iron or by filtration through nylon wool columns. It is less efficiently removed by filtration through Sephades G-10 columns, and is completely resistant to the cytotoxic effects of silica. From a practical point of view, extraction of a spleen cell suspension with carbonyl iron is a useful method of obtaining fully responsive lymphocyte populations from rat spleen.

A number of murine plasmacytomas secreting different classes of Ig have been tested for plaque formation with these indicator red cells. In the presence of complement-binding antibodies specific for the corresponding class of secreted Ig, between 10 and 70% of all plated myeloma cells formed plaques. The assay shows a prozone effect in excess of antibody, suggesting that complexes of antibody and secreted Ig effect lysis of the target cells. This assay can be used to enumerate cells secreting any molecules for which complement-binding antibodies are available.

6276967|a|Plaque assays have been used to study thyroglobulin autoantibody synthesis and total immunoglobulin production by cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Freshly isolated Hashimoto or normal lymphocytes contained small numbers (7-1300) of total IgG plaque-forming cells (PFC) and total IgM PFC, but specific thyroglobulin antibody PFC was undetectable. After 5-8 days' culture with pokeweek mitogen (PWM), total IgG and IgM PFC were markedly increased to a geometric mean of 10,140 (8414-12,220) IgG PFC and 3450 (163-7534) IgM PFC per 10(6) cultured lymphocytes (95% confidence limits in parentheses). Furthermore, a mean of 63 (22-287) specific IgG thyroglobulin antibody PFC per 10(6) lymphocytes were detectable in cultures of Hashimoto lymphocytes. The IgG thyroglobulin antibody PFC were stimulated by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, suggesting that EBV infection may be useful in obtaining monoclonal thyroid autoantibodies.

794410|a|Thyroid antibodies in the sera of BUF rats are closely correlated with spontaneous thyroiditis; their detection may facilitate the study of this animal model of organ-specific autoimmunity. In a group of 115 retired BUF breeders (females older than 1 year), 26% had mononuclear cell infiltration of the thyroid and high titers of thyroid antibodies detectable by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and chromic chloride passive hemagglutination (CCH). In contrast, low-titered thyroid antibodies were present in 9% of the rats that had normal thyroids. Sequential studies performed on a group of 76 neonatally thymectomized BUF rats showed that at 2 months 24% had high titers of thyroid antibodies detectable by IF and 8% by CCH and at 3 months these percentages increased to 27% by IF and 25% by CCH. When the rats were sacrificed at 4 months, at a time when spontaneous disease is not seen in untreated animals, 26% were found to have mononuclear cell infiltration of their thyroids. Approximately 75% of these rats with thyroiditis had been positive for thyroid antibodies at 2 months and 90% at 3 months. At sacrifice all of these animals had high-titered antibodies to thyroid antigens. In contrast, low-titered thyroid antibodies were present in 36% of the animals without thyroiditis. Intravenous injection of BUF thymus cells into neonatally thymectomized rats failed to reduce the incidence of thyroiditis and thyroid antibodies. Approximately 33% of these animals had both thyroid infiltration and serum antibodies, whereas 19% of those with normal thyroids had low-titered thyroid antibodies. Titers of circulating thyroid antibodies were closely correlated with the initial and intermediate stages of thyroiditis, i.e., animals with less infiltration had the lowest titers, whereas animals with intermediate levels of infiltration had high antibody titers. On the other hand, rats with a high degree of thyroid infiltration had relatively lower titers of thyroid antibodies. Direct IF of infiltrated thyroids revealed the presence of rat immunoglobulins in these organs, suggesting a possible direct or indirect role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of the disease. We attempted to detect delayed hypersensitivity by skin testing with thyroid antigens and observing reactions at 4, 24, and 48 hr. All of 123 rats were negative, 20% of which had thyroiditis and thyroid antibodies. No serum MIF activity was detected in rats with thyroiditis and those with normal thyroids. The absence of delayed hypersensitivity reactions in these experiments provides further support for the contention that spontaneous thyroiditis in the BUF rat may be antibody mediated.

792344|a|Experimental autoimmune thyroiditis was induced in out-bred guinea pigs by isoimmunization with thyroid extract in complete Freund's adjuvant. A digestion procedure using collagenase and deoxyribonuclease was used to make viable single-cell suspensions of pooled thyroid glands from groups of animals with advanced degrees of thyroiditis. Thymus-derived or T lymphocytes, identified by their capacity to form E rosettes with rabbit erythrocytes, were found to be the predominant (75%) infiltrating lymphocyte; bone marrow-derived or B cells consitituted most of the remainder. The infiltrates of inbred animals with thyroiditis were demonstrated to contain cells capable of mediating antibody-dependent lymphoid cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

1081932|a|Strain differences in susceptibility to the development of thyroiditis following adult thymectomy and repeated sublethal X-irradiation (4 X 200 rad) were investigated in the rat. Marked strain variation was noted, with AUG and PVG/c rats having the highest incidence and severity of lesion (100 and 80% respectively) whilst CAM rats had a low incidence (9%). WAG and LIS rats occupied an intermediate position. The incidence of autoantibodies to thyroglobulin correlated closely with the strain incidence of thyroiditis (r = 0-87). Fractionation of the sera from thymectomized and irradiated rats by gel filtration chromatography indicated that the bulk of the antibodies to thyroglobulin were of the IgG class. Freund's complete adjuvant, but not lipopolysaccharide, enhanced the rate of development of thyroiditis in thymectomized rats given a shortened series of irradiations. It was not found possible to induce thyroiditis in thymectomized rats by substituting antilymphocyte serum for irradiation as a T cell-depleting agent, despite the fact that the treated rats had markedly reduced responses to phytohaemagglutinin. A combination of thymectomy, three doses of 200 rad, and a development period of 8 weeks were found to be the optimum conditions for induction of severe thyroiditis together with high antibody titres to thyroglobulin. These findings add support for the role of thymus-derived cells in the regulation of autoimmune responses and further suggest that thymectomy, combined with a series of sublethal irradiations, causes a selective depletion of those T cells specifically involved in the suppression of autoimmune reactivity to thyroid components, whilst leaving autoreactive helper T cells unimpaired.

1081924|a|Ten inbred strains of rats were immunized with crude homologous thyroglobulin emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant in order to investigate strain susceptibility to the induction of both thyroiditis and antibody to thyroglobulin. Two strains (LH and AUG) were found to be extremely susceptible and had 100% incidence of thyroid lesions which in general varied from moderate to very severe (mean index of pathology+/-SE, 2-5+/-0-2 and 2-1+/-0-4 respectively). One other strain (HL) also had 100% incidence of lesions but there were consistently mild in character (1-1+/-0-1). Two strains (DA and SD) were variable, with thyroid change varying from negative to severe. Three strains (LEW, WAG and PVG/c) had occasional lesions and the remaining two strains (AS and CAM) showed no thyroid change. Four strains (LH, AUG, HL and DA) consistently produced good antibody responses to thyroglobulin (mean titres+/-SE 7-3+/-0-3, 9-5+/-0-4, 6-9+/-0-3 and 6-6+/-0-5 respectively). In contrast WAG and CAM rats failed to develop autoantibody and the responses of AS, PVG/c and SD strain rats were quite variable. Although the autoantibody response generally correlated well with the presence of thyroiditis in a particular strain, LEW, AS and PVG/c rats often had good antibody levels with minimal thyroid lesions. Females of the most susceptible strains (LH and AUG) were found to have significantly more severe thyroid lesions and higher antibody titres to thyroglobulin than males. The most susceptible strains were all found to be of the Ag-B5 major histocompatibility genotype whilst the least susceptible were of the Ag-B2 genotype. However, wide interstrain variability was noted within the Ag-B5 genotype particularly with respect to the induction and extent of thyroid lesions. It was not found possible to relate the divergence in susceptibility between rat strains of Ag-B5 and Ag-B2 genotypes to differences in respective numbers of thyroglobulin-binding cells within the circulation of the non-immunized animal. Similarly, there were no differences in response between a susceptible (LH) and non-susceptible (CAM) strain to the phytomitogens PHA and Con A.

336837|a|We have investigated the influence of human T cells on the synthesis and secretion of immunoglobulin by peripheral blood B cells. The plaque-forming assay used, which identified the number of B cells secreting Ig, is a short-term assay which requires no exogenous stimulation. We have shown that the B-cell population alone contains fewer secreting cells than the total lymphocyte population, and that T cells are required to achieve maximal plaque-forming cell levels. Cycloheximide treatment of cells at concentrations known to inhibit protein synthesis does not affect the cooperative potential of these cells. Additionally, this cooperation effect is markedly better among autologous mixtures of Ig- and Ig+ cells, than among mixtures obtained from randomly selected individuals.

6972539|a|The precise events associated with B cell activation in humans are a subject of intense investigation. It has been difficult to develop an in vitro model of antigen-specific triggering of antibody synthesis by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that is independent of exogenous mitogens. In the present study a sensitive and reproducible culture system and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay have been established wherein antigen alone is used to trigger antigen-specific antibody synthesis by mononuclear cells from subjects immunized to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). The in vitro antigen-induced anti-KLH response is comparable in magnitude to that induced by pokeweed mitogen, is predominantly IgM in isotype, and is accompanied by a simultaneous increase in polyclonal antibody production. Anti-KLH responses were seen at in vitro KLH concentrations as low as 0.05 microgram/ml. However, concentrations of KLH greater than 5 microgram/ml resulted in profound suppression of the anti-LHL response while continuing to trigger large amounts of total polyclonal immunoglobulin synthesis. This suppression by high concentrations of antigen was also observed in pokeweed mitogen-driven anti-KLH production. These observations are consistent with previous results from the mouse model showing a close association between antigen-specific and polyclonal responses and the phenomenon of antigen-induced, antigen-specific suppression. Thus, an in vitro model of antigen induction of antigen-specific antibody synthesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells has been demontrated and should prove useful in exploring the mechanism of human B cell activation and immunoregulation.

Whereas depletion of macrophages from normal rat spleen cells permitted the PFC response to SRBC to occur, comparable treatment of mouse spleen cells eliminated the PFC response. These results are discussed in relation to the requirement for macrophages in the generation of PFC with rat cells in vitro.

During the first and third four-week periods, patients on an egg and cows' milk exclusion diet received a soya-based milk substitute (trial period) or an egg and cows' milk preparation (control period). Response was assessed in terms of eczema activity, number of areas affected, pruritus, sleeplessness, and antihistamine usage while on the two diets. During the middle period patients resumed their normal diet to minimise any carry-over effect. 14 patients responded more favourably to the antigen-avoidance diet than to the control diet, whereas only 1 responded more favourably to the control diet than the trial diet. Patients experienced more benefit during the first diet period than the second, whatever the nature of the diet.

Positive skin tests were found more often in children with a history of egg or cows' milk allergy than in children with no such history. 40 children suspected of being allergic to egg or milk, by history or by positive skin tests, were tested by double-blind food challenge. 54 challenges were given to these children, and 26 (49%) were positive. Children suspected of being allergic to egg had a greater incidence of positive challenges than children suspected of having milk allergy. Children with both a present history of food allergy and a positive skin test for that allergen were more likely to have positive challenges than children having only one of these indicators. Most children with positive challenges failed to satisfy Goldman's criterion of a minimum of three positive challenges because of the severity of their reactions. Less stringent criteria are needed for the diagnosis of food allergy in children who are particularly sensitive to food allergens.

874209|a|Forty patients were administered a total of 2,395 skin tests in order to assess the effects of method, concentration, diluent, manufacturer, and mixtures on patient reaction to inhalant extract solutions. The prick method was found to be superior to the scratch method. The intracutaneous technique exhibited the greatest degree of specificity. Patients reacted at a higher level to higher concentrations of extract solution, descending to a lower level of reaction to lesser concentrations of extract solution. Patient reactions were variable to aqueous vs glycerin solutions. Clear differences in the potency of extract solutions produced by manufacturers A, B, and C were evident. Specifically, the products of manufacturer C were least potent. The results illustrate the possibility of a dilution factor existing in mixtures of extract solutions, producing a decrease in their potency when compared to the potency of their individually administered components. A technique with the potential for wide acceptance and clinical applicability is proposed.

Cutaneous reactions evoked by graded amounts of food extracts were compared with results of double-blind food challenge and in vitro release of histamine from leucocytes. A 3 mm or greater weal reaction in skin tests by puncture technique using food extracts of 1:20 w/v concentration was found to indicate the degree of hypersensitivity likely to be associated with clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions to food. Proper use of this simple technique will facilitate accurate diagnosis of food hypersensitivity in children by identifying the group among whom all positive reactions to food challenges will be found. Nevertheless, double-blind food challenge is essential to establish a diagnosis of symptomatic hypersensitivity to food.

7389066|a|Skin test materials vary in their potency and specificity. Although 3 mm reactions are often regarded as diagnostic of a type 1 allergy, a study based on 100 allergy clinic patients with food intolerance showed that thirteen out of fifteen patients with a 3 mm reaction to common inhalant allergens had no RAST-detectable allergen-specific IgE. Three millimetre reactions were significant for milk and egg extracts. Food intolerance was clinically demonstrable in six out of seven patients giving a 4 mm skin reaction and in ten out of thirteen with a 3 mm reaction. There was, however, a "clinically false positive" reaction of 3 mm or more in 3.8% of allergy clinic patients for milk and 2.8% for egg. In fifteen out of nineteen patients with a clinical diagnosis of fish allergy, the diagnosis was supported by a skin test reaction of 5 mm or more. However, seven patients with no history of intolerance to fish gave a 4 mm reaction to the same extract. Reactions of less than 5 mm were thus unhelpful clinically.

Medication was started two days before the inoculation of 2 X 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective doses of A University of Maryland/2/74 (H3N2) influenza virus and was continued for eight days after challege. Nine of the 10 subjects who received ribavirin, eight of the nine subjects who received placebo, and six of the 10 subjects who received amantadine developed influenzal illness. Significantly less virus was isolated from the amantadine-treated group than from the placebo-treated or the ribavirin-treated group. Antibody responses of the ribavirin-treated and placebo-treated groups were quite similar to each other; however, prophylactic treatment with amantadine significantly reduced titers of serum antibody and febrile responses. In a separate clinical trial involving challenge with A/Dunedin/73 (H3N2) influenza virus, ribavirin also failed to show prophylactic effectiveness.

6768812|a|Rhesus monkeys were experimentally infected with Lassa virus to establish their suitability as a nonhuman primate model for the human disease and to test the protective efficacy of ribavirin, an antiviral drug. Six of 10 untreated control monkeys died after subcutaneous inoculation of 10(6.1) plaque-forming units of Lassa virus (strain Josiah). Infectivity titrations of tissue homogenates from the six dead monkeys indicated significant replication in all tissues tested except the central nervous system. This distribution of virus was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence examination of cryostat-sectioned tissues. Ribavirin was beneficial in the treatment of two groups of infected monkeys. Four monkeys first treated on the day of viral inoculation experienced only mild clinical disease; four monkeys first treated five days later experienced a more severe illness. None of the eight monkeys treated with ribavirin died. Viremia titers and elevations of levels of serum transaminases in treated monkeys were significantly lower than in controls. Ribavirin may be beneficial in the treatment of humans exposed to this life-threatening virus.

921245|a|The prophylactic effectiveness of oral administration of ribavirin (1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) against experimentally induced influenza A infection was evaluated in a double-blind clinical trial in normal volunteers. Fourteen men received ribavirin capsules (1,000 mg/day in four divided doses) and 15 other men received identical-appearing placebo capsules beginning 6 h after the intranasal inoculation of 3.4 log(10) 50% tissue culture infectious doses of influenza virus A/Victoria/3/75 H3N2 and continuing for 5 days after challenge. The total number of moderate-to-severe symptom scores and the total number of temperatures >/=100 degrees F (37.8 degrees C) were significantly lower in the ribavirin group compared with the placebo group. The mean quantity of virus shed in nasal wash specimens and the total number of days that there were viral titers greater than 1.0 log(10) 50% tissue culture infectious doses per ml were significantly greater in the placebo group. There was no difference between the frequencies of virus isolated or the antibody responses in the two groups. Therefore, prophylactic ribavirin ameliorated symptoms and fever indicative of moderate-to-severe illness, but had no effect on the manifestations of mild illness in response to influenza A challenge. A transient rise in total serum bilirubin occurred in 29% of the ribavirin-treated volunteers and in none of the placebo-treated volunteers.

822705|a|Infections or inflammatory states often cause significant increases in serum phenylalanine and the phenylalanine-tyrosine ratio. More than 95% of samples obtained during inflammatory diseases in man showed phenylalanine-tyrosine ratio increases greater than the maximum normal values. An increase in this ratio also occurred in monkeys with induced Rocky Mountain spotted fever, viral encephalitis, yellow fever, or pneumococcal and Salmonella infections, as well as in rats with pneumococcal and Salmonella infections, as well as in rats with pneumococcal, Salmonella or tularemia infections. A similar ratio increase occurred in rats inoculated with unpurified mediator substances (released by activated leukocytes) that appear to initiate many of the secondary metabolic phenomena associated with infection and/or inflammation. To identify responsible mechanisms, rats were given lethal doses of Streptococcus pneumoniae; serum phenylalanine and phenylalanine-tyrosine ratios increased significantly. Hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase activities were slightly decreased when compared to noninfected controls. Infected and noninfected rats showed comparable oxidation rates for 14C-phenylalanine given with an oral phenylalanine load, as a pulse-oral dose, or as an intraperitoneal injection. After 8 hr, both infected and control rats had similar amounts of radioactivity in total body protein, but tissue distributions were markedly altered during pneumococcal sepsis. Serum proteins of infected rats contained almost twice as much total radioactivity as that found in controls, while the amount of labeled phenylalanine in skeletal muscle protein was significantly reduced in the infected group. Isolated muscles from infected rats released more phenylalanine and less tyrosine than control muscles. Infection-related increases in serum phenlalanine could not be explained by decreased hydroxylation or oxidation. Rather, the data were consistent with an increased flux of phenylalanine into serum, most likely as the result of increased skeletal muscle catabolism. Elevations in the serum phenylalanine-tyrosine ratio have potential value for estimating the presence of an inflammatory fisease and the catabolic state of a patient.

500806|a|Properties of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase in erythroblasts of patients with pyridoxine-responsive anemia were investigated with special reference to the protease in mitochondria of erythroblasts. delta-Aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity in erythroblasts of patients with this disease before treatment was extremely decreased, whereas it gradually increased in parallel with the improvement of anemia by the therapy with pyridoxal phosphate. The amount of apo-delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase in erythroblasts before treatment was also extremely diminished. Apparent affinity to pyridoxal phosphate of the apo-delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase obtained from erythroblasts of the patients was almost the same as that of normal controls. The activity of a new protease which is considered to be engaged in the regulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase levels in mitochondria of erythroblasts was shown to be in normal range in erythroblasts of the patients. On the other hand, apo-delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase obtained from the patients was extremely sensitive to the protease. These results indicate that disturbance of heme synthesis characteristic to pyridoxine-responsive anemia could be ascribed to the hypercatabolism of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase caused by the increased susceptibility to the controlling protease in erythroblasts.

4825227|a|A new, specific, and simple method for the determination of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase activity in human bone marrow cells has been developed. ALA synthetase of erythroblasts was partially purified so as to permit the use of [(14)C]succinyl-CoA as a substrate for this enzyme. In this enzyme preparation there were negligible activities of succinyl-CoA hydrolase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and succinyl-CoA synthetase and there was no activity of ALA dehydrase. The ALA formed from [(14)C]succinyl-CoA has been isolated by column chromatography. Radioactivity in the eluate from the column has been proved by paper chromatography to be exclusively that of [(14)C]ALA. The entire assay can be completed within 4 h, and [(14)C]succinyl-CoA was incorporated into [(14)C]ALA on the order of several percent. Moderate to marked decreases of ALA synthetase activity have been demonstrated in the erythroblasts of all cases of sideroblastic anemia. In the cases of iron deficiency anemia, on the other hand, normal or slightly elevated activity has been obtained.

5784213|a|Yeast cells grown under optimal and suboptimal concentrations of biotin were analyzed for the amino acid content of their soluble pool and cellular protein. Optimally grown yeast cells exhibited a maximum amino acid content after 18 hr of growth. Biotin-deficient cells were depleted of all amino acids at 26 and 43 hr, with alanine, arginine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, serine, threonine, and valine being present in less than half the concentration observed in biotin-optimal cells. At early time intervals, the amino acid pool of biotin-deficient yeast contained lower concentrations of all amino acids except alanine. After more prolonged incubation, several amino acids accumulated in the pool of biotin-deficient yeast, but citrulline and ornithine accumulated to appreciable levels. The addition of aspartate to the growth medium resulted in a decrease in the amino acid content of biotin-optimal cells but caused a marked increase in the concentration of amino acids in biotin-deficient cells. The pools of biotin-deficient yeast grown in the presence of aspartate displayed a marked reduction in every amino acid with the exception of aspartate itself. These data provide evidence that the amino acid content of yeast cells and their free amino acid pools are markedly affected by biotin deficiency as well as by supplementation with aspartate, indicating that aspartate plays a major role in the nitrogen economy of yeast under both normal as well as abnormal nutritional conditions.

708751|a|The cells of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 grown with added thiamine in a vitamin B-6-free medium did not contain ergosterol and zymosterol (the predominant sterols in cells grown without thiamine). Instead, significant amounts of squalene, lanosterol and unidentified sterols accumulated in the thiamine-grown cells. Of the unidentified sterols, the most predominant was delta5,7-ergostadien-3beta-ol at 26.0% of the total sterol. The accumulation of this sterol in the place or ergosterol (delta5,7,22-ergostatrien-3beta-ol) indicates that the desaturation at C-22 of sterol structure is completely blocked in the thiamine-grown cells. On the basis of chromatographic behaviours, the structures of other unidentified sterols were assumed to be 4alpha-methyl-delta8,24(25)-cholestadien-3beta-ol, 4alpha-methyl-delta 8,24(28)-ergostadien-3beta-ol, delta8,24(28)-ergostadien-3beta-ol and delta5,7,24(28)-ergostatrien-3beta-ol. The accumulation of 4alpha-methyl sterols, in addition to that of a large amount of lanosterol (48.4% of total sterol), suggests that the demethylation processes from lanosterol to zymosterol was partially depressed in the thiamine-grown cells.

856287|a|The lipid composition of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 cells grown aerobically in the presence of thiamine and absence of pyridoxine was markedly different from that of cells grown without addition of both of the growth factors. In addition to the previous observations showing a reduction in the levels of unsaturated fatty acids (Nishikawa, Y., Nakamura, I., Kamihara, T. and Fukui, S. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 59, 777-780) and lack of zymosterol and ergosterol (Nagai, J., Katsuki, H., Nishikawa, Y., Nakamura, I., Kamihara, T. and Fukui, S. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 60, 555-560), the thiamine-grown cells were found to contain low levels of total lipids, sterols (especially in the form of esters), triacylglycerols and total phospholipids. However, relative contents of triacylglycerols and phospholipids to total lipids were higher than those of control cells. Hydrocarbons and diacylglycerols accumulated to appreciable degrees. Phospholipid composition was also influenced by thiamine. The ratio of phosphatidylinositol to total phospholipids increased, whereas that of phosphatidylethanolamine decreased. The levels of phosphatidylcholine plus phosphatidylserine decreased in a similar ratio to that of total phospholipids. It was found that unsaturated fatty acid contents were low in all lipid esters tested. The effect of thiamine was particularly noteworthy in the case of sterol esters. Concomitant addition of pyridoxine with thiamine to the medium brought about a normal lipid composition in the yeast cells.

1711326|a|Research over the past 5 years has demonstrated that immunologic activation of mouse macrophages induces the activity of nitric oxide synthase, which oxidizes a guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine, yielding citrulline and the reactive radical, nitric oxide. A review of the biochemistry and immunologic regulation of this pathway in macrophages provides a backdrop against which to evaluate its effector functions. Reports published in the past 2 years suggest that synthesis of NO mediates much of the antimicrobial activity of mouse macrophages against some fungal, helminthic, protozoal and bacterial pathogens.

1373522|a|Nitric oxide (NO) conveys a variety of messages between cells, including signals for vasorelaxation, neurotransmission, and cytotoxicity. In some endothelial cells and neurons, a constitutive NO synthase is activated transiently by agonists that elevate intracellular calcium concentrations and promote the binding of calmodulin. In contrast, in macrophages, NO synthase activity appears slowly after exposure of the cells to cytokines and bacterial products, is sustained, and functions independently of calcium and calmodulin. A monospecific antibody was used to clone complementary DNA that encoded two isoforms of NO synthase from immunologically activated mouse macrophages. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to confirm most of the amino acid sequence. Macrophage NO synthase differs extensively from cerebellar NO synthase. The macrophage enzyme is immunologically induced at the transcriptional level and closely resembles the enzyme in cytokine-treated tumor cells and inflammatory neutrophils.

7678412|a|Macrophages can become activated to kill both tumor cells and a variety of microbes. Results here show that synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), a mediator of many macrophage cytotoxic functions, was greatly increased when cells of the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 were costimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), compared to LPS alone. This increase paralleled increases in cytotoxicity. Northern analysis showed that increased production of NO was preceded by markedly enhanced expression of mRNA for the inducible form of macrophage NO synthase (mac-NOS), which catalyzes the synthesis of NO. Cycloheximide inhibited the induction of mac-NOS mRNA by IFN-gamma and LPS, indicating that expression of this mRNA required de novo protein synthesis. Elevated expression of mac-NOS mRNA was not due to an increase in its stability. Rather, the combination of IFN-gamma and LPS induced a much higher rate of transcription of the mac-NOS gene than did stimulation with LPS alone. These results provide one explanation of why priming and triggering stimuli, such as IFN-gamma and LPS, respectively, synergistically activate macrophages and may be applicable to explaining how IFN-gamma augments NO-dependent microbicidal activity in macrophages as well.

7692452|a|The promoter region of the mouse gene for macrophage-inducible nitric oxide synthase (mac-NOS; EC 1.14.13.39) has been characterized. A putative TATA box is 30 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Computer analysis reveals numerous potential binding sites for transcription factors, many of them associated with stimuli that induce mac-NOS expression. To localize functionally important portions of the regulatory region, we constructed deletion mutants of the mac-NOS 5' flanking region and placed them upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. The macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, when transfected with a minimal promoter construct, expresses little luciferase activity when stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), or both. Maximal expression depends on two discrete regulatory regions upstream of the putative TATA box. Region I (position -48 to -209) increases luciferase activity approximately 75-fold over the minimal promoter construct. Region I contains LPS-related responsive elements, including a binding site for nuclear factor interleukin 6 (NF-IL6) and the kappa B binding site for NF-kappa B, suggesting that this region regulates LPS-induced expression of the mac-NOS gene. Region II (position -913 to -1029) alone does not increase luciferase expression, but together with region I it causes an additional 10-fold increase in expression. Together the two regions increase expression 750-fold over activity obtained from a minimal promoter construct. Region II contains motifs for binding IFN-related transcription factors and thus probably is responsible for IFN-mediated regulation of LPS-induced mac-NOS. Delineation of these two cooperative regions explains at the level of transcription how IFN-gamma and LPS act in concert to induce maximally the mac-NOS gene and, furthermore, how IFN-gamma augments the inflammatory response to LPS.

7510419|a|Production of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages is important for the killing of intracellular infectious agents. Interferon (IFN)-gamma and lipopolysaccharide stimulate NO production by transcriptionally up-regulating the inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Macrophages from mice with a targeted disruption of the IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene (IRF-1-/- mice) produced little or no NO and synthesized barely detectable iNOS messenger RNA in response to stimulation. Two adjacent IRF-1 response elements were identified in the iNOS promoter. Infection with Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) was more severe in IRF-1-/- mice than in wild-type mice. Thus, IRF-1 is essential for iNOS activation in murine macrophages.

7520478|a|Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) interacts synergistically with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce transcription of iNOS, the isoform of nitric oxide synthase whose activity is independent of elevated Ca2+ and exogenous calmodulin. To define a cis-acting element mediating IFN-gamma-dependent synergy, we made deletions in iNOS promoter constructs fused to reporter genes, transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages, and treated the cells with IFN-gamma and/or LPS. This analysis implicated the region from positions -951 to -911, a cluster of four enhancer elements known to bind IFN-gamma-responsive transcription factors, including an interferon regulatory factor binding site (IRF-E) at nucleotides -913 to -923. Site-specific substitution of two conserved nucleotides within IRF-E in the context of the full-length iNOS promoter ablated IFN-gamma's contribution to synergistic enhancement of transcription. Electromobility shift assays performed with a probe containing IRF-E revealed the existence of a complex in nuclei of RAW 264.7 macrophages that was present only after treatment with IFN-gamma, which reacted specifically with anti-IRF-1 immunoglobulin G and which included a species migrating at 40-45 kD, consistent with the apparent molecular weight of murine IRF-1. Thus, the synergistic contribution of IFN-gamma to transcription of iNOS in RAW 264.7 macrophages requires that IRF-1 bind to IRF-E in the iNOS promoter. In conjunction with the work of Kamijo et al. (Kamijo, R., H. Harada, T. Matsuyama, M. Bosland, J. Gerecitano, D. Shapiro, J. Le, K. S. Im, T. Kimura, S. Green et al. 1994. Science [Wash. DC]. 263:1612), these findings identify iNOS as the first gene that requires IRF-1 for IFN-gamma-dependent transcriptional regulation.

7508926|a|The promoter of the murine gene encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) contains an NF-kappa B site beginning 55 base pairs upstream of the TATA box, designated NF-kappa Bd. Reporter constructs containing truncated promoter regions, when transfected into macrophages, revealed that NF-kappa Bd is necessary to confer inducibility by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Oligonucleotide probes containing NF-kappa Bd plus the downstream 9 or 47 base pairs bound proteins that rapidly appeared in the nuclei of LPS-treated macrophages. The nuclear proteins bound to both probes in an NF-kappa Bd-dependent manner, but binding was resistant to cycloheximide only for the shorter probe. The proteins binding both probes reacted with antibodies against p50 and c-rel but not RelB; those binding the shorter probe also reacted with anti-RelA (p65). Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, which acts as a specific inhibitor of NF-kappa B, blocked both the activation of the NF-kappa Bd-binding proteins and the production of NO in LPS-treated macrophages. Thus, activation of NF-kappa B/Rel is critical in the induction of iNOS by LPS. However, additional, newly synthesized proteins contribute to the NF-kappa Bd-dependent transcription factor complex on the iNOS promoter in LPS-treated mouse macrophages.

1907934|a|Interferons have been shown to be potential anti-cancer agents and to inhibit tumor cell growth in culture. The in vivo mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect may be direct or indirect through the immune system; however, in vitro a primary mechanism of cytotoxicity is through the depletion of tryptophan. In particular, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induces an enzyme of tryptophan catabolism, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which is responsible for conversion of tryptophan and other indole derivatives to kynurenine. The inhibitory effect of interferon on many intracellular parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii and Chlamydia trachomatis is by the same mechanism. Elevated kynurenine levels have been found in humans in a number of diseases and after interferon treatment, and the enzyme is induced in rodents after administration of interferon inducers, or influenza virus. IDO induction also occurs in vivo during rejection of allogeneic tumors, indicating a possible role for this enzyme in the tumor rejection process. The gene for IDO has been cloned and shown to be differentially regulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma. IDO induction has been correlated with induction of GTP-cyclohydrolase, the key enzyme in pteridine biosynthesis. A direct role for IDO in pteridine synthesis has not been shown, and this parallel induction may reflect coordinate regulation of genes induced by IFN-gamma. A possible role for IDO in O2-radical scavenging and in inflammation is discussed.

2500976|a|Interferon-gamma-induced tryptophan metabolism of human macrophages was compared to ten human neoplastic cell lines of various tissue origin and to normal dermal human fibroblasts. Tryptophan and metabolites were determined in supernatants of cultures, after incubation for 48 h, by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and fluorescence detection. With the exception of two cell lines (Hep G 2, hepatoma and CaCo 2, colon adenocarcinoma) in all of the ten other cells and cell lines tryptophan degradation was induced by interferon-gamma. Five of these ten formed only kynurenine (SK-N-SH, neuroblastoma; T 24, J 82, bladder carcinoma; A 431, epidermoid carcinoma; normal dermal fibroblasts), three formed kynurenine and anthranilic acid (U 138 MG, glioblastoma; SK-HEP-1, hepatoma; A 549, lung carcinoma). Only one line, A 498 (kidney carcinoma) showed the same pattern of metabolites as macrophages (kynurenine, anthranilic acid and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid). Interferon-gamma regulated only the activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. All other enzyme activities detected were independent of interferon-gamma, as shown by the capacity of the cells to metabolize L-kynurenine or N-formyl-L-kynurenine. Increasing the extracellular L-tryptophan concentration resulted in a marked induction of tryptophan degradation by macrophages. Contrarily, a significant decrease of the tryptophan degrading activity was observed when the extracellular L-tryptophan concentration was increased 2-fold with SK-N-SH, T 24 and J 82, 4-fold with A 431 and A 549 and 10-fold with U 138 MG and SK-HEP-1. The activity was unaffected by extracellular L-tryptophan with dermal fibroblasts and A 498. Though interferon-gamma was the most potent inducer of tryptophan metabolism, interferon-alpha and/or -beta showed small but distinct action on some of the cells. In all cells which reacted to interferon-gamma by enhanced expression of class I and/or class II major histocompatibility complex antigens tryptophan degradation was also inducible. These results demonstrate that induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is a common feature of interferon-gamma action, that the extent of this induction is influenced by extracellular L-tryptophan concentrations and that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is the only enzyme in the formation of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid from tryptophan which is regulated by interferon-gamma.

3095441|a|Human recombinant gamma interferon (rHuIFN-gamma) was found to induce tryptophan degradation in vitro in human cell cultures and in vivo in participants in phase I clinical trials. When human lung fibroblasts were treated with various concentrations of rHuIFN-gamma, they degraded tryptophan in a dose- and time-dependent manner. No tryptophan degradation was observed when cells were incubated in growth medium alone or in medium supplemented with human recombinant beta-interferon (rHuIFN-beta ser). Similarly human bladder carcinoma cells were induced to catabolize tryptophan after incubation with rHuIFN-gamma, but no activity was observed in untreated cells or cells treated with either rHuIFN-beta ser or human naturally produced alpha-interferon (HuIFN-alpha). When tryptophan plasma levels were measured in cancer patients who had received i.v. bolus injections of rHuIFN-gamma as part of a phase I clinical trial, decreased tryptophan levels were observed when compared with pretreatment values or values obtained from individuals who had received i.v. injections of HuIFN-alpha. Urine analyses were suggestive that plasma tryptophan degradation occurred via the kynurenine catabolic pathway in individuals who received rHuIFN-gamma. We conclude that tryptophan degradation is an activity induced in vitro and in vivo in response to exogenous IFN-gamma but not to IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. Tryptophan degradation may play an important role in the mechanism of antiproliferative, immunologic, and clinical side effects of IFN-gamma.

In all other tissues tested, no significant increase in enzyme activity was observed. The effect appeared to be specific for the lipopolysaccharide fraction because glycogen and zymosan were almost ineffective under the same experimental conditions. In the lung, the enzyme activity increased almost linearly during the first 24 hr after a single injection of the lipopolysaccharide fraction (20 microgram per mouse). The enzyme activity started to decrease after 48 hr and reached a normal value after about 6 days. The increase in enzyme activity was completely abolished by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Other enzymes in the lung such as beta-glucuronidase, acid phosphatase, and monoamine oxidase did not change significantly with this treatment.

3124115|a|The antiproliferative effects of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) were found to be cell-dependent. Among the human cell lines examined, IFN-gamma had a greater antiproliferative effect against cell lines that exhibited induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, such as the KB oral carcinoma or WiDr colon adenocarcinoma, than against those that lacked the enzyme activity, such as the SW480 colon adenocarcinoma or NCI-H128 small-cell lung carcinoma. Induction of this dioxygenase showed a clear temporal relationship with increased metabolism of L-tryptophan and the depletion of this amino acid in the culture medium. While 70-80% of L-tryptophan remained in the medium of IFN-alpha- or vehicle-treated cells, virtually all of this amino acid was depleted in the medium of the IFN-gamma-treated group following 2-3 days of culture. Supplementing the growth medium with additional L-tryptophan reversed the antiproliferative effect of IFN-gamma against KB cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma on SW480 and NCI-H128 cells, which are independent of the dioxygenase activity, and the inability of added L-tryptophan to reverse the effects of IFN-gamma in WiDr cells suggest multiple mechanisms of action of the IFNs. The data show that the antiproliferative effect of IFN-gamma through induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, with a consequent L-tryptophan deprivation, is an effective means of regulating cell growth.

3121172|a|In addition to its antiviral and antibacterial activities, recombinant human gamma-interferon (rHuIFN-gamma) can exert an antiproliferative effect on human cell lines. The mechanisms involved in this antiproliferative activity are poorly understood, but it is known that IFN-gamma can induce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which enhances tryptophan metabolism and thus depletes the cellular pool of this amino acid. In the present study we have examined the effect of different tryptophan concentrations on the antiproliferative activity of rHuIFN-gamma on four human tumor cell lines, HeLa 229, HEp-2, A549, and T24. Cells were grown in the presence of rHuIFN-gamma (0.01 to 100 ng/ml) and/or tryptophan (10 to 400 micrograms/ml) for 7 days at which time they were counted. rHuIFN-gamma (4 ng/ml) inhibited the growth of A549 and T24 cells by 50%. Hep-2 and HeLa 229 cells were more sensitive to the rHuIFN-gamma induced antiproliferative effects, requiring only 0.4 ng/ml for a 50% inhibition. Addition of tryptophan to the media at concentrations from 10 to 100 micrograms/ml resulted in a significant blockage of the antiproliferative activity of rHuIFN-gamma. For example, when 50 micrograms/ml of tryptophan were added to the media, 10 times more rHuIFN-gamma (4 ng/ml) was needed to inhibit HeLa 229 cells by 50% of the control. The A549 was the most sensitive cell line to the modulatory activity of the tryptophan. Addition of 10 micrograms/ml of tryptophan changed the amount of rHuIFN-gamma needed to produce a 50% inhibition from 4 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml. In summary, in the four human tumor cell lines tested, the antiproliferative activity of rHuIFN-gamma could be modulated by the concentration of tryptophan in the media.

1322853|a|Accumulation of the neurotoxin quinolinic acid within the brain occurs in a broad spectrum of patients with inflammatory neurologic disease and may be of neuropathologic significance. The production of quinolinic acid was postulated to reflect local induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by cytokines in reactive cells and inflammatory cell infiltrates within the central nervous system. To test this hypothesis, macaques received an intraspinal injection of poliovirus as a model of localized inflammatory neurologic disease. Seventeen days later, spinal cord indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity and quinolinic acid concentrations in spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid were both increased in proportion to the degree of inflammatory responses and neurologic damage in the spinal cord, as well as the severity of motor paralysis. The absolute concentrations of quinolinic acid achieved in spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid exceeded levels reported to kill spinal cord neurons in vitro. Smaller increases in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity and quinolinic acid concentrations also occurred in parietal cortex, a poliovirus target area. In frontal cortex, which is not a target for poliovirus, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was not affected. A monoclonal antibody to human indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was used to visualize indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase predominantly in grey matter of poliovirus-infected spinal cord, in conjunction with local inflammatory lesions. Macrophage/monocytes in vitro synthesized [13C6]quinolinic acid from [13C6]L-tryptophan, particularly when stimulated by interferon-gamma. Spinal cord slices from poliovirus-inoculated macaques in vitro also converted [13C6]L-tryptophan to [13C6]quinolinic acid. We conclude that local synthesis of quinolinic acid from L-tryptophan within the central nervous system follows the induction of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, particularly within macrophage/microglia. In view of this link between immune stimulation and the synthesis of neurotoxic amounts of quinolinic acid, we propose that attenuation of local inflammation, strategies to reduce the synthesis of neuroactive kynurenine pathway metabolites, or drugs that interfere with the neurotoxicity of quinolinic acid offer new approaches to therapy in inflammatory neurologic disease.

8514884|a|HIV encephalitis is unusual in that neurologic damage occurs in the absence of significant infection of neuronal or glial cells. Because the predominant infected cell in the brain is the macrophage, it has been proposed that release of viral or immune activation factors from macrophages may mediate neurologic damage. Numerous studies have examined the concentration of immune activation factors in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), however, there has been no correlation between these CSF measurements and severity of HIV encephalitis (Wiley, C.A., C.L. Achim, R.D. Schrier, M.P. Heyes, J.A. McCutchen, and I. Grant. 1992. AIDS (Phila.). 6:1299-1307. Because CSF measurements may not represent tissue concentrations of these factors, we examined the concentrations of HIV p24, quinolinic acid (QUIN), IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and GMCSF within the brains of 10 AIDS autopsies. Homogenization and extraction of cortical gray, cortical white and deep gray matter showed a good correlation between the amount of HIV gp41 immunostaining and extracted HIV gag protein p24. The concentrations of cytokines were low in the tissue extracts and showed no correlation with severity of HIV encephalitis. Brain extracts from mild cases of HIV encephalitis showed elevated levels of TNF-alpha in deep gray matter, while in more severe cases, elevated TNF-alpha levels were also found within cortical white and cortical gray matter. Brain tissue and CSF QUIN concentrations were substantially increased compared to control values. QUIN concentrations were not correlated with the severity of HIV encephalitis. We conclude that increased tissue levels of TNF-alpha and QUIN may have a role in the etiology of HIV-related neurologic dysfunction.

2788032|a|Immune stimulation or interferon administration induces indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and GTP cyclohydrolase activity in humans, resulting, respectively, in tryptophan degradation to kynurenine and in neopterin production. To determine if similar effects result from interleukin 2 (IL-2) administration, plasma tryptophan and urinary kynurenine and neopterin were measured in patients undergoing a phase 1 toxicity trial of recombinant IL-2 given by daily bolus or continuous i.v. administration for 7 days at doses of 1 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(7) units/m2/day. Significant dose-dependent decreases in plasma tryptophan levels and corresponding increases in urinary kynurenine and neopterin were observed. These metabolic effects of IL-2 are probably mediated by induction of gamma-interferon production, although elevated levels of gamma-interferon were not found in the sera of these patients. In view of the indispensable role of tryptophan in synthesis of protein, niacin, and serotonin, we suggest that some of the toxic side effects may be the result of this loss of tryptophan. Since these metabolic changes were detected at relatively low doses of IL-2, these assays provide a highly sensitive means for monitoring in vivo metabolic responses to IL-2 therapy.

The ligand was isolated by chromatography on Dowex 50, Dowex 1, and Sephadex G-15 equilibrated with 0.153 mM Zn(NO3)2. Mass spectroscopy, thin-layer chromatography, and infrared spectroscopy proved that the zinc-binding ligand isolated by this method from human milk is pyridine-2-carboxylic acid, commonly known as picolinic acid. The concentration of picolinic acid in human milk was 308 microM, the concentration in one brand of processed cow's milk was 20 microM, but picolinic acid was undetectable in a second brand of cow's milk and in four different infant formulas. Weanling rats fed supplemental picolinic acid absorbed significantly more dietary zinc and gained significantly more weight than rats fed an unsupplemented diet. The results suggest that the high bioavailability of zinc in human milk results from the presence of picolinic acid, a bidentate chelating ligand which facilitates zinc absorption from the intestine.

Human milk contained less than 3.7 microM PA. PA was undetectable in human infant or rat intestine or in human or rat pancreatic juice. The extremely low concentration of PA in milk and its apparent absence in pancreatic juice and intestine provide additional evidence that PA is not the low molecular weight zinc binding ligand of human milk and that it does not have an important physiological role in intestinal zinc absorption.

3428125|a|Activation and subsequent enhancement of cytotoxicity of mouse peritoneal macrophages (M phi) by picolinic acid (PLA) in vivo have been reported previously by the authors' group. The optimum dose was found to be 100 mg/kg. PLA-stimulated M phi lysed different tumor targets in vitro, MBL-2 lymphoma cells and Madison 109 lung carcinoma cells, with equal efficiency. Treatment with PLA was performed daily for 5 consecutive days with a dose of 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally in C57/BL mice, which previously had been inoculated with MBL-2 tumor cells. Treatment was initiated on the first day after tumor inoculation. Oral treatment with PLA (200 mg/kg) dissolved in the drinking water was also performed for 7 days. In addition, some groups received PLA treatment 1 or 2 days before tumor implantation but not afterwards, to elucidate the in vivo efficacy of M phi activation. Intraperitoneal therapy with PLA after tumor inoculation resulted in a highly significant increase in lifespan (46%); intraperitoneal pretreatment caused a significant increase (15%); orally administered PLA was without effect. Thus intraperitoneal treatment with PLA was found to have protective and therapeutic effects against the MBL-2 ascites tumor in vivo. These effects are most likely caused by macrophage activation.

1701787|a|We have studied the effects of picolinic acid, a product of tryptophan degradation, on the activation of mouse peritoneal macrophages (M phi). Picolinic acid acts synergistically with IFN-gamma in activating M phi from C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, M phi from C3H/HeJ mice and C3H/HeN that do not become cytotoxic in response to IFN-gamma alone could be fully activated by exposure to picolinate plus IFN-gamma. These results indicate that picolinic acid is a potent costimulator of M phi activation that functions as a second signal. Inasmuch as we have previously demonstrated that the activation of cytotoxic M phi correlates with specific changes in ribosomal RNA (rRNA), we investigated whether picolinic acid could modify M phi RNA metabolism. Picolinic acid inhibited the synthesis of total M phi RNA, the accumulation of newly synthesized 28S rRNA, and augmented the steady state levels of rRNA precursors (pre-rRNA). These changes in RNA metabolism were similar to those previously described in murine M phi activated in vitro or in vivo to express tumoricidal activity. These results demonstrate that picolinic acid is a potent, biologic M phi second signal, suggest that the changes in rRNA are causally connected with the expression of tumoricidal activity, and suggest the existance of an autocrine effect mediated by picolinic acid.

1940368|a|We reported previously that IL-2 induces tumoricidal activity in IFN-gamma-treated murine macrophages. The present study was performed to investigate the regulation of IL-2-dependent tumoricidal activity in murine macrophage cell lines. The v-raf/v-myc-immortalized murine macrophage cell lines ANA-1, GG2EE, and HEN-CV did not express constitutive levels of cytotoxic activity against P815 mastocytoma cells. Moreover, these macrophage cell lines did not become tumoricidal after exposure to IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-2 or LPS. However, these macrophages developed cytotoxic capabilities after incubation with either IFN-gamma plus IL-2 or IFN-gamma plus LPS. IL-4 inhibited IFN-gamma plus IL-2- but not IFN-gamma plus LPS-induced tumoricidal activity. This effect of IL-4 was not restricted to v-raf/v-myc-immortalized macrophage cell lines because similar results were obtained by using a macrophage cell line that was established from a spontaneous histiocytic sarcoma. The suppressive activity of IL-4 on the ANA-1 macrophage cell line was dose-dependent (approximately 12-200 U/ml) and was neutralized by the addition of anti-IL-4 mAb. IL-4 decreased the IFN-gamma-induced expression of mRNA for the p55 (alpha) subunit of the IL-2R in ANA-1 macrophages. Therefore, at least one mechanism by which IL-4 may have inhibited IFN-gamma plus IL-2-induced tumoricidal activity was by reducing macrophage IL-2R alpha mRNA expression. We have previously reported that picolinic acid, a tryptophan metabolite, is a costimulator of macrophage tumoricidal activity. We now report that IL-4 also inhibited IFN-gamma plus picolinic acid-induced cytotoxicity in ANA-1 macrophages. We propose that IL-2 and picolinic acid may have a common mechanism of action that is susceptible to IL-4 suppression.

3139754|a|We immortalized the GG2EE macrophage (M phi) cell line by infection of freshly isolated bone marrow cells with the recombinant J2 retrovirus carrying v-raf and v-myc oncogenes. We investigated the expression of J2 virus mRNA in relationship with the proliferative ability and tumoricidal activity of GG2EE cells exposed to biologic response modifiers (BRM). Calcium ionophore (Ca2+I), picolinic acid (PA), or IFN-gamma were employed to activate GG2EE cells. Each BRM was due to inhibit the proliferation of GG2EE cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas only Ca2+I or the combined treatment with PA plus IFN-gamma induced tumoricidal GG2EE cells. J2 virus mRNA expression was not affected by PA or IFN-gamma, but it was dramatically decreased by Ca2+I or PA plus IFN-gamma. These results indicated that the expression of J2 mRNA can be inhibited in GG2EE cells by appropriate BRM such as Ca2+I or IFN-gamma plus PA. In contrast, the expression of 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase mRNA was augmented to similar levels by treatment of the GG2EE cells with IFN-gamma alone or in combination with PA. The down-regulation of J2 mRNA expression was not associated with the antiproliferative activity of the BRM but rather with their ability to induce tumoricidal activity. These results suggest that the process of activation of tumoricidal macrophages also triggers a mechanism(s) of resistance to viral mRNA expression. Moreover, the finding that IFN-gamma or PA inhibit cell proliferation but not J2 mRNA expression indicates that the intracellular targets of these BRM are intact, independent from and unaffected by J2 virus expression.

8473748|a|In this study we investigated the effects of picolinic acid, a catabolite of L-tryptophan, on the production of L-arginine-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates in the murine macrophage cell line ANA-1. ANA-1 macrophages did not produce nitrite (NO2-) constitutively, but accumulated detectable levels of NO2- on exposure to IFN-gamma. Picolinic acid, although ineffective by itself, augmented IFN-gamma-induced NO2- production. The activity of picolinic acid was evident at 1 mM and reached its maximum at 4 mM. Picolinic acid also augmented the IFN-gamma-dependent expression of TNF-alpha mRNA, but did not appreciably affect the secretion of the TNF-alpha protein. Neutralizing concentrations of anti-TNF mAb completely abrogated IFN-gamma- and IFN-gamma plus rTNF-alpha-induced NO2- production in ANA-1 macrophages, but only decreased by approximately 50% the synergistic interaction between IFN-gamma and picolinic acid. Although IL-4 inhibited the expression of IFN-gamma plus picolinic acid-induced TNF-alpha mRNA and protein, it only partially suppressed picolinic acid-dependent NO2- production. Therefore, picolinic acid may affect NO2- production via both TNF-alpha-dependent and TNF-alpha-independent pathways. Overall, this study suggests that amino acid catabolites may be important for the activation and the expression of effector functions by murine macrophages, and provides the first evidence of a possible connection between tryptophan and arginine metabolism.

7510678|a|Picolinic acid, a catabolite of L-tryptophan, is a potent co-stimulatory agent for the induction of tumoricidal activity and the production of L-arginine-dependent reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) in murine macrophages. We studied whether picolinic acid could affect nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) expression at the gene level in the macrophage cell line ANA-1. NOS mRNA was neither constitutively expressed nor induced by treatment with picolinic acid alone. However, low levels of NOS mRNA were induced by interferon (IFN)-gamma alone. In contrast, a major increase of NOS mRNA expression was observed after treatment with IFN-gamma plus picolinic acid. The synergism was already detectable after 5-6 h and increased up to 20 h of treatment. The ability of picolinic acid to augment IFN-gamma-dependent NOS mRNA expression was associated with a parallel increase in transcription, as demonstrated by nuclear run-on experiments. Protein synthesis was required for the induction of NOS mRNA because addition of cycloheximide dramatically reduced IFN-gamma plus picolonic acid-induced NOS mRNA expression. Finally, interleukin-4 significantly decreased IFN-gamma plus picolinic acid-induced NOS mRNA expression and NOS transcription. These data provide evidence of a molecular event connecting arginine and tryptophan metabolic pathways in the generation of RNI, and they indicate that picolinic acid can induce transcriptional activation of gene expression.

Proto-oncogenes seem to be involved in cellular proliferation and/or differentiation and may also play a role in the myelopoietic process. Murine myeloid precursors which are grown in vitro with growth factors respond with augmented self-renewal upon infection with recombinant retroviruses carrying the v-myc or v-src oncogenes, suggesting a synergism or complementation between some viral oncogenes (v-onc) and certain growth factors. We now show that the combination of two v-onc genes (raf and myc) induces the selective proliferation of monocytic cells from fresh murine bone marrow (BM) in the absence of a specific growth factor supplement. Depending on the culture conditions these cells can either differentiate and cease to proliferate or grow continuously, thus mimicking the alternative pathways that can be followed by committed BM stem cells in vivo.

6960240|a|We constructed a series of recombinant genomes which directed expression of the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in mammalian cells. The prototype recombinant in this series, pSV2-cat, consisted of the beta-lactamase gene and origin of replication from pBR322 coupled to a simian virus 40 (SV40) early transcription region into which CAT coding sequences were inserted. Readily measured levels of CAT accumulated within 48 h after the introduction of pSV2-cat DNA into African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells. Because endogenous CAT activity is not present in CV-1 or other mammalian cells, and because rapid, sensitive assays for CAT activity are available, these recombinants provided a uniquely convenient system for monitoring the expression of foreign DNAs in tissue culture cells. To demonstrate the usefulness of this system, we constructed derivatives of pSV2-cat from which part or all of the SV40 promoter region was removed. Deletion of one copy of the 72-base-pair repeat sequence in the SV40 promoter caused no significant decrease in CAT synthesis in monkey kidney CV-1 cells; however, an additional deletion of 50 base pairs from the second copy of the repeats reduced CAT synthesis to 11% of its level in the wild type. We also constructed a recombinant, pSV0-cat, in which the entire SV40 promoter region was removed and a unique HindIII site was substituted for the insertion of other promoter sequences.

1448077|a|We have identified a 50-nucleotide enhancer from the human erythropoietin gene 3'-flanking sequence which can mediate a sevenfold transcriptional induction in response to hypoxia when cloned 3' to a simian virus 40 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and transiently expressed in Hep3B cells. Nucleotides (nt) 1 to 33 of this sequence mediate sevenfold induction of reporter gene expression when present in two tandem copies compared with threefold induction when present in a single copy, suggesting that nt 34 to 50 bind a factor which amplifies the induction signal. DNase I footprinting demonstrated binding of a constitutive nuclear factor to nt 26 to 48. Mutagenesis studies revealed that nt 4 to 12 and 19 to 23 are essential for induction, as substitutions at either site eliminated hypoxia-induced expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a nuclear factor which bound to a probe spanning nt 1 to 18 but not to a probe containing a mutation which eliminated enhancer function. Factor binding was induced by hypoxia, and its induction was sensitive to cycloheximide treatment. We have thus defined a functionally tripartite, 50-nt hypoxia-inducible enhancer which binds several nuclear factors, one of which is induced by hypoxia via de novo protein synthesis.

1372907|a|Macrophages activated by exposure to cytokines and/or to endotoxin produce nitric oxide (NO.), a free radical that is a mediator of the host response to infection. Activation induces the expression of nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes formation of NO. from L-arginine and molecular oxygen. We report the cloning of a cDNA encoding the inducible nitric oxide synthase from a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, exposed to interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide. Oocytes injected with mRNA transcribed from this cDNA demonstrate arginine-dependent production of nitrite, a stable metabolite of NO.. Nitric production is blocked by the enzyme inhibitor, NG-monomethylarginine, and is independent of calcium/calmodulin. RAW264.7 cells demonstrate rapid accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase-encoding mRNAs upon activation. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence to the calcium/calmodulin-dependent nitric oxide synthase previously purified (Bredt, D. S., and Synder, S.H. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

8460154|a|Adaptive responses to hypoxia occur in many biological systems. A well-characterized example is the hypoxic induction of the synthesis of erythropoietin, a hormone which regulates erythropoiesis and hence blood oxygen content. The restricted expression of the erythropoietin gene in subsets of cells within kidney and liver has suggested that this specific oxygen-sensing mechanism is restricted to specialized cells in those organs. Using transient transfection of reporter genes coupled to a transcriptional enhancer lying 3' to the erythropoietin gene, we show that an oxygen-sensing system similar, or identical, to that controlling erythropoietin expression is wide-spread in mammalian cells. The extensive distribution of this sensing mechanism contrasts with the restricted expression of erythropoietin, suggesting that it mediates other adaptive responses to hypoxia.

8387214|a|Transcription of the human erythropoietin (EPO) gene is activated in Hep3B cells exposed to hypoxia. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a nuclear factor whose DNA binding activity is induced by hypoxia in Hep3B cells, and HIF-1 binds at a site in the EPO gene enhancer that is required for hypoxic activation of transcription. In this paper, we demonstrate that HIF-1 DNA binding activity is also induced by hypoxia in a variety of mammalian cell lines in which the EPO gene is not transcribed. The composition of the HIF-1 DNA binding complex and its isolated DNA binding subunit and the mechanism of HIF-1 activation appear to be similar or identical in EPO-producing and non-EPO-producing cells. Transcription of reporter genes containing the EPO gene enhancer is induced by hypoxia in non-EPO-producing cells and mutations that eliminate HIF-1 binding eliminate inducibility. These results provide evidence that HIF-1 and its recognition sequence are common components of a general mammalian cellular response to hypoxia.

Using transient transfection in HepG2 cells, we have defined a DNA sequence, located 120 base pairs 3' to the poly(A)-addition site of the mouse erythropoietin gene, that confers oxygen-regulated expression on a variety of heterologous promoters. The sequence has the typical features of a eukaryotic enhancer. Approximately 70 base pairs are necessary for full activity, but reiteration restores activity to shorter inactive sequences. This enhancer operates in HepG2 and Hep3B cells, but not in Chinese hamster ovary cells or mouse erythroleukemia cells, and responds to cobalt but not to cyanide or 2-deoxyglucose, thus reflecting the physiological control of erythropoietin production accurately.

8408001|a|Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a DNA binding activity detected in nuclear extracts from Hep3B cells cultured in 1% O2 but not in extracts from cells cultured in 20% O2. HIF-1 binds to a sequence within the human erythropoietin gene enhancer that is required for hypoxic activation of transcription. Induction of HIF-1 is inhibited by cycloheximide, which also inhibits induction of erythropoietin RNA. We now demonstrate that induction of both HIF-1 and erythropoietin RNA is inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine. HIF-1 binding to DNA was eliminated by phosphatase treatment of nuclear extracts. Actinomycin D also inhibited HIF-1 induction, suggesting that de novo transcription is required. The kinetics of HIF-1 induction by hypoxia paralleled the kinetics of erythropoietin gene transcriptional induction. HIF-1 DNA binding activity decayed rapidly when hypoxic cells were exposed to increased oxygen tension. In vitro, the kinetics of HIF-1 association with, and dissociation from, its binding site were extremely rapid, with a t1/2 for both processes of < 1 min. These findings are consistent with the proposed function of HIF-1 as a physiologic regulator of gene expression that responds to changes in cellular oxygen tension. Methylation interference analysis indicated that HIF-1 makes specific contacts with DNA in the major groove.

1874713|a|Erythropoietin gene expression is greatly stimulated under conditions of hypoxia. The activation of the erythropoietin gene appears regulated primarily at the level of gene transcription. To study cis-acting elements involved in the response to hypoxia a mini-gene was constructed by an internal deletion from exon II to V of the human erythropoietin gene and used in transient transfection assays in the erythropoietin producing Hep 3B cell line. It was initially found that hypoxia responsiveness was present in an erythropoietin fragment containing 400 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking and 600 bp of 3'-flanking regions. Deletion analysis showed no significant effect on the response to hypoxia when highly conserved regions of 5'-flanking sequence, exon and intron I, and exon V were removed from the mini-gene construct. However, removal of a fragment containing the 3' end of the gene and 3'-flanking sequences completely eliminated hypoxia responsiveness. Reinsertion of the above fragment upstream of the 5' end of the mini-gene restored the response to hypoxia. Further analysis using hybrid erythropoietin-chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase constructs allowed the localization of enhancer-like element(s) in the 3'-flanking region, approximately 120 bp downstream of the polyadenylation site of the human erythropoietin gene. Activation by these sequences were position- and orientation-independent and stimulated 15-fold transcription of the erythropoietin gene in response to hypoxia.

8089148|a|Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates erythropoietin gene transcription in Hep3B cells subjected to hypoxia. HIF-1 activity is also induced by hypoxia in non-erythropoietin-producing cells, suggesting a more general regulatory role. We now report that RNAs encoding the glycolytic enzymes aldolase A (ALDA), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and pyruvate kinase M were induced by exposure of Hep3B or HeLa cells to inducers of HIF-1 (1% O2, cobalt chloride, or desferrioxamine), whereas cycloheximide blocked induction of glycolytic RNAs and HIF-1 activity. Oligonucleotides from the ALDA, PGK1, enolase 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, and phosphofructokinase L (PFKL) genes, containing sequences similar to the HIF-1 binding site in the erythropoietin enhancer, specifically bound HIF-1 present in crude nuclear extracts or affinity-purified preparations. Sequences from the ALDA, PFKL, and PGK1 genes containing HIF-1 binding sites mediated hypoxia-inducible transcription in transient expression assays. These results support the role of HIF-1 as a mediator of adaptive responses to hypoxia that underlie cellular and systemic oxygen homeostasis.

8022811|a|Production of the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Epo) in response to hypoxic stimuli is almost entirely restricted to particular cells within liver and kidney, yet the transcriptional enhancer lying 3' to the Epo gene shows activity inducible by hypoxia after transfection into a wide variety of cultured cells. The implication of this finding is that many cells which do not produce Epo contain a similar, if not identical, oxygen-regulated control system, suggesting that the same system is involved in the regulation of other genes. We report that the human phosphoglycerate kinase 1 and mouse lactate dehydrogenase A genes are induced by hypoxia with characteristics which resemble induction of the Epo gene. In each case expression is induced by cobalt, but not by cyanide, and hypoxic induction is blocked by the protein-synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. We show that the relevant cis-acting control sequences are located in the 5' flanking regions of the two genes, and we define an 18-bp element in the 5' flanking sequence of the phosphoglycerate kinase 1 gene which is both necessary and sufficient for the hypoxic response, and which has sequence and protein-binding similarities to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 binding site within the Epo 3' enhancer.

3262668|a|The depletion of an essential amino acid, tryptophan, caused by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase induction in vitro, has been shown to be due to a mechanism that is used in self-defense against inhaled microorganisms and tumor growth. In this communication, we report the results of measuring dioxygenase activity in the peritoneal exudate cells and tumor cytotoxicity at the transplantation loci after in vivo transplantation of tumor cells into the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic or allogeneic strains of mice. The enzyme was induced only when the tumor cells were being rejected from allogeneic animals and no change was observed when the cells continued to grow in syngeneic animals. Furthermore, when the syngeneic tumor cells in a diffusion chamber were i.p. transplanted simultaneously with i.p. injection of allogeneic tumor cells, the enzyme was induced not only in allografted tumor cells but also in the syngeneic tumor cells. Under these conditions, the tumor cells in the diffusion chamber ceased to grow and 50% of the cells were rejected. To determine the type of cells containing the induced enzyme, the peritoneal exudate cells (tumor cells and host cells--mostly small lymphocytes) were separated into six fractions by sedimentation under gravity and by differential centrifugation. Approximately 80% of total enzyme activity was localized in a tumor-rich fraction (98.9% purity), whereas only 0.2% of the activity was found in a lymphocyte-rich fraction (99.5% purity). The localization of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in the tumor cells was confirmed by complement-dependent lysis with specific antibodies against tumor and host cells.

2116480|a|The depletion of an essential amino acid, tryptophan, caused by induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), has been shown to be a mechanism involving self-defense against inhaled microorganisms and tumor growth. We recently reported that the IDO is dramatically (approximately 50-fold) induced in allografted tumor (3-methylcholanthrene-induced ascites type tumor cells) cells undergoing rejection, and that the enzyme is induced by factor(s) released through the interaction of allografted tumor cells with infiltrating leukocytes. The culture supernatant of infiltrating leukocytes, which were harvested on day 7 after tumor transplantation, induced the highest IDO activity in the tumor cells. The inducer activity was completely neutralized by the addition of antibody to IFN-gamma but not by antibody to IFN-alpha/beta. Approximately 6 U/ml of IFN-gamma was detected by an ELISA assay in the 12-h culture supernatant with 2 x 10(6) leukocytes/ml, and rIFN-gamma at 6 U/ml induced IDO in 3-methylcholanthrene-induced ascites type tumor cells to the same extent as IFN-gamma in the culture supernatant. Moreover, i.p. administration of antibody to IFN-gamma almost completely inhibited the induction of IDO in the allografted tumor cells. These observations indicate that the factor responsible for IDO induction in the allografted tumor cells is IFN-gamma.

1648737|a|Nitric oxide (NO.), a free radical that is generated from L-arginine by stimulated endothelial cells, neutrophils, activated macrophages, and other cell types, reacts with superoxide anion (O2.-) to form peroxynitrite, which itself may be tissue toxic or can then react further to form the highly reactive and toxic hydroxyl radical (HO.). Because vascular injury produced by tissue deposition of immune complexes is linked to formation of toxic products derived from activated neutrophils, we have assessed whether immune complex-induced injury of rat lung and dermal vasculature is arginine dependent. The arginine analogue, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (N-MeArg), which blocks NO. formation, protects against immune complex-induced vascular injury in rats. The protective effects of N-MeArg are reversed by the presence of L-arginine but not D-arginine. Additionally, in the absence of N-MeArg, injury is enhanced by the presence of L-arginine but not by D-arginine. Protection by N-MeArg is not associated with diminished recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from animals undergoing immune complex deposition in lung contain the decomposition products of NO.--namely, nitrite and nitrate. In the presence of N-MeArg these products are greatly diminished. These data suggest that immune complex-induced injury of rat lung and skin is L-arginine dependent. These data also suggest that in vivo metabolic products of L-arginine, such as NO(.), are directly or indirectly linked to immune complex-induced tissue injury.

7522365|a|The L-arginine:nitric oxide (NO) biosynthetic pathway has been proposed as an important mediator in host defense mechanisms and may therefore play a role in the acute allograft response. We have studied NO generation in liver allograft rejection and determined its value in immunological monitoring. Stable end products of this pathway have been determined serially in 50 primary liver recipients and compared with 2 known mediators and markers of acute allograft rejection (IL-2R positive lymphocytes and circulating TNF alpha). Plasma concentrations of acid-labile nitrosocompounds (NOx), which increased during acute allograft rejection (P < 0.0001), correlated with rejection severity and were reduced after administration of supplemental high dose glucocorticoids. Concentrations were significantly lower in nonrejection graft complications but were elevated during episodes of sepsis. Correlations between plasma NOx levels and circulating TNF-alpha (r = 0.451, P < 0.001) and IL-2R-positive lymphocytes in peripheral blood (r = 0.781, P < 0.001) were demonstrated. In a logistic analysis of these variables, plasma NOx was the most predictive parameter of an episode of acute cellular rejection. Nitric oxide generation in FK506-treated patients was lower compared with patients receiving a CsA-based immunosuppression regimen and was associated with a reduced frequency of acute rejection in the FK506 group. These data are consistent with a role for NO in the cellular alloantigen immune response and indicate that monitoring of plasma levels of NOx may be useful in the detection of acute allograft rejection.

7518842|a|Cardiac transplantation, effective therapy for end-stage heart failure, is frequently complicated by allograft rejection, the mechanisms of which remain incompletely understood. Nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator which is cytotoxic and negatively inotropic, can be produced in large amounts by an inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in response to cytokines. To investigate whether iNOS is induced during cardiac allograft rejection, hearts from Lewis or Wistar-Furth rats were transplanted into Lewis recipients. At day 5, allogeneic grafts manifested reduced contractility and histologic evidence of rejection (inflammatory infiltrate, edema, necrosis of myocytes). The mRNA for iNOS and iNOS protein were detected in ventricular homogenates and in isolated cardiac myocytes from rejecting allogeneic grafts but not in tissue and myocytes from syngeneic control grafts. Immunocytochemistry showed increased iNOS staining in infiltrating macrophages and in microvascular endothelial cells and cardiac muscle fibers and also in isolated purified cardiac myocytes from the rejecting allografts. Using a myocardial cytosolic iNOS preparation, nitrite formation from L-arginine and [3H] citrulline formation from [3H]L-arginine were increased significantly in the rejecting allogeneic grafts (P < 0.01). Myocardial cyclic GMP was also increased significantly (P < 0.05). The data indicate myocardial iNOS mRNA, protein and enzyme activity are induced in infiltrating macrophages and cardiac myocytes of the rejecting allogeneic grafts. Synthesis of NO by iNOS may contribute to myocyte necrosis and ventricular failure during cardiac allograft rejection.

7528779|a|The role of nitric oxide in the immune response to allogeneic tissue was explored in an in vivo cardiac transplant model in the rat. Nitric oxide production during organ rejection was demonstrated by elevations in systemic serum nitrite/nitrate levels and by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Messenger RNA for the inducible nitric oxide synthase enzyme was detected in the rejecting allografted heart, but not in the nonrejecting isografted heart. The enzyme was demonstrated to be biologically active by the in vitro conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline and was immunohistochemically localized to the infiltrating inflammatory cells. Treatment with aminoguanidine, a preferential inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase isoform, prevented the increased nitric oxide production in the transplanted organ and significantly attenuated the pathogenesis of acute rejection. Aminoguanidine treatment prolonged graft survival, improved graft contractile function, and significantly reduced the histologic grade of rejection. These results suggest an important role for nitric oxide in mediating the immune response to allogeneic tissue. Inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase may provide a novel therapeutic modality in the management of acute transplant rejection and of other immune-mediated processes.

1279431|a|Inefficient vascular supply and the resultant reduction in tissue oxygen tension often lead to neovascularization in order to satisfy the needs of the tissue. Examples include the compensatory development of collateral blood vessels in ischaemic tissues that are otherwise quiescent for angiogenesis and angiogenesis associated with the healing of hypoxic wounds. But the presumptive hypoxia-induced angiogenic factors that mediate this feedback response have not been identified. Here we show that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; also known as vascular permeability factor) probably functions as a hypoxia-inducible angiogenic factor. VEGF messenger RNA levels are dramatically increased within a few hours of exposing different cell cultures to hypoxia and return to background when normal oxygen supply is resumed. In situ analysis of tumour specimens undergoing neovascularization show that the production of VEGF is specifically induced in a subset of glioblastoma cells distinguished by their immediate proximity to necrotic foci (presumably hypoxic regions) and the clustering of capillaries alongside VEGF-producing cells.

7531613|a|The nitric oxide synthases (NOS) are a family of related enzymes which regulate the production of NO, a free radical gas implicated in a wide variety of biological processes. Vasodilation and increased tumor blood flow, increased vascular permeability, modulation of host tumoricidal activity, and free radical injury to tumor cells and adjacent normal tissues are pathophysiological features of malignant tumors that may be mediated by NO. We examined human brain tumors for three NOS isoforms and NADPH diaphrase, a histochemical marker of NOS activity in the brain. We detected increased expression of the brain and endothelial forms of NOS [NOS I and NOS II, respectively (C. Nathan and Q. Xie. Cell, 78: 915-919, 1994)] in astrocytic tumors, and the highest levels of expression was found in higher grade tumors. Each of these two isoforms was found in tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells. The macrophage isoform of NOS (NOS III) was less frequently detected and expressed at a lower level, predominantly in tumor endothelial cells. NADPH diaphorase staining for NOS activity paralleled this pattern of NOS expression. Western blot analysis of tumor tissues for these NOS isoforms confirmed these observations. Our data indicate that malignant central nervous system neoplasms express unexpectedly high levels of NOS and suggest that NO production may be associated with pathophysiological processes important to these tumors.

We have cloned and characterized the tra-2 gene. Its putative protein has a domain that is homologous to RNA binding proteins. This suggests that the tra-2 protein might achieve the female-specific splicing of the transcript of dsx, a sex-determining gene whose mode of expression depends on tra-2. The protein coding region of the tra-2 transcript is identical in males and females. In both sexes, a low level of transcript is present in the soma and a high level in the germ line.

3144435|a|The switch gene, Sex-lethal (Sxl), controls sexual development and dosage compensation. It must be active in females and inactive in males throughout development. Analysis of Sxl cDNAs shows that this on/off regulation may be explained by differential RNA splicing; only female transcripts appear to encode functional products, whereas all male transcripts contain an exon that truncates the open reading frame. The functional female product shows sequence similarities with ribonucleoproteins, suggesting that it is an RNA binding protein. Thus, we propose that Sxl encodes a factor that interacts with both its own pre-mRNA (accounting for positive autoregulation) and that of downstream genes to confer female-specific splicing. In this way, a single, simple mechanism could account for both the maintenance and expression of the sexually determined state.

A 5-amino-acid segment in the RNA-binding domain of the U2 snRNP-B" protein was found to confer U2 RNA recognition when substituted into the corresponding position in the U1 snRNP-A protein. In addition, B", but not A, was found to require the U2 snRNP-A' protein as an accessory factor for high-affinity binding to U2 RNA. The pentamer segment in B" that conferred U2 RNA recognition was not sufficient to allow the A' enhancement of U2 RNA binding by B", thus implicating other sequences in this protein-protein interaction. Sequence elements involved in these interactions have been localized to variable loops of the RNA-binding domain as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (D. Hoffman, C.C. Query, B. Golden, S.W. White, and J.D. Keene, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, in press).

These two RNAs are shown to be present throughout the life cycle, and related by the use of alternative first intron splice acceptor sites. The non-sex-specific RNA has a 73 base first intron, while that in the female-specific RNA is 248 bases. The non-sex-specific RNA has no long open reading frame, while the female-specific RNA has a single long open reading frame beginning at the first AUG. Substitution of a heat shock promoter for the tra promoter still leads to female-specific differentiation of otherwise tra-females. We suggest a mechanism by which Sex-lethal controls itself and tra.

1675426|a|The poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is the major mRNA-binding protein in eukaryotes, and it is essential for viability of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The amino acid sequence of the protein indicates that it consists of four ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence-containing RNA-binding domains (RBDs I, II, III, and IV) and a proline-rich auxiliary domain at the carboxyl terminus. We produced different parts of the S. cerevisiae PABP and studied their binding to poly(A) and other ribohomopolymers in vitro. We found that none of the individual RBDs of the protein bind poly(A) specifically or efficiently. Contiguous two-domain combinations were required for efficient RNA binding, and each pairwise combination (I/II, II/III, and III/IV) had a distinct RNA-binding activity. Specific poly(A)-binding activity was found only in the two amino-terminal RBDs (I/II) which, interestingly, are dispensable for viability of yeast cells, whereas the activity that is sufficient to rescue lethality of a PABP-deleted strain is in the carboxyl-terminal RBDs (III/IV). We conclude that the PABP is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that has at least two distinct and separable activities: RBDs I/II, which most likely function in binding the PABP to mRNA through the poly(A) tail, and RBDs III/IV, which may function through binding either to a different part of the same mRNA molecule or to other RNA(s).

3952495|a|Splicing in vitro of a messenger RNA (mRNA) precursor (pre-mRNA) is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to the C proteins (anti-C) of the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA)-ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) particles. This antibody, 4F4, inhibits an early step of the reaction: cleavage at the 3' end of the upstream exon and the formation of the intron lariat. In contrast, boiled 4F4, or a different monoclonal antibody (designated 2B12) to the C proteins, or antibodies to other hnRNP proteins (120 and 68 kilodaltons) and nonimmune mouse antibodies have no inhibitory effect. The 4F4 antibody does not prevent the adenosine triphosphate-dependent formation of a 60S splicing complex (spliceosome). Furthermore, the 60S splicing complex contains C proteins, and it can be immunoprecipitated with 4F4. Depletion of C proteins from the splicing extract by immunoadsorption with either of the two monoclonal antibodies to the C proteins (4F4 or 2B12) results in the loss of splicing activity, whereas mock-depletion with nonimmune mouse antibodies bodies has no effect. A 60S splicing complex does not form in a C protein-depleted nuclear extract. These results indicate an essential role for proteins of the hnRNP complex in the splicing of mRNA precursors.

In contrast, after cellular blastoderm the first two of these introns cease to be efficiently removed. The mature RNAs resulting from this failure to remove the first two introns have structures quite unexpected of mRNAs.

We show that U1 snRNP interacts specifically with both the 5' and 3' splice sites in the presence of ATP and that SC35 is required for these ATP-dependent interactions. Significantly, the SC35-dependent interaction between U1 snRNP and the 3' splice site requires U2 snRNP but not the 5' splice site. We also show that SC35 is required for the ATP-dependent interaction between U2 snRNP and the branch-point sequence.

3029566|a|To study factors that influence the choice of alternative pre-mRNA splicing pathways, we introduced plasmids expressing either wild-type or mutated simian virus 40 (SV40) early regions into tissue culture cells and then measured the quantities of small-t and large-T RNAs produced. One important element controlling splice site selection was found to be the size of the intron removed in the production of small-t mRNA; expansion of this intron (from 66 to 77 or more nucleotides) resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of small-t mRNA produced relative to large-T mRNA. This suggests that in the normal course of SV40 early pre-mRNA processing, large-T splicing is at a competitive advantage relative to small-t splicing because of the small size of the latter intron. Several additional features of the pre-mRNA that can influence splice site selection were also identified by analyzing the effects of mutations containing splice site duplications. These include the strengths of competing 5' splice sites and the relative positions of splice sites in the pre-mRNA. Finally, we showed that the ratio of small-t to large-T mRNA was 10 to 15-fold greater in human 293 cells than in HeLa cells or other mammalian cell types. These results suggest the existence of cell-specific trans-acting factors that can dramatically alter the pattern of splice site selection in a pre-mRNA.

1454802|a|The human pre-mRNA splicing factors SF2 and SC35 have similar electrophoretic mobilities, and both of them contain an N-terminal ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-type RNA-recognition motif and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich domain. However, the two proteins are encoded by different genes and display only 31% amino acid sequence identity. Here we report a systematic comparison of the splicing activities of recombinant SF2 and SC35. We find that either protein can reconstitute the splicing activity of S100 extracts and of SC35-immunodepleted nuclear extracts. Previous studies revealed that SF2 influences alternative 5' splice site selection in vitro, by favoring proximal over distal 5' splice sites, and that the A1 protein of heterogeneous nuclear RNP counteracts this effect. We now show that SC35 has a similar effect on competing 5' splice sites and is also antagonized by A1 protein. In addition, we report that both SF2 and SC35 also favor the proximal site in a pre-mRNA containing duplicated 3' splice sites, but this effect is not modulated by A1. We conclude that SF2 and SC35 are distinct splicing factors, but they display indistinguishable splicing activities in vitro.

2163768|a|SV40 early pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced by utilization of two different 5' splice sites and a shared 3' splice site to produce large T and small t mRNAs. The ratio of small t to large T mRNAs produced in human embryonic kidney 293 cells is 10- to 20-fold greater than in other mammalian cells, suggesting the existence of a 293 cell-specific factor that modulates alternative splicing. Here we show that nuclear extracts from 293 cells give rise to significantly more small t splicing than do extracts from HeLa cells. Using an in vitro complementation assay, we have characterized and extensively purified a factor from 293 extracts that brings about striking increases in small t splicing with concomitant decreases in large T splicing. The factor is heat sensitive and micrococcal nuclease resistant, suggesting that it is a protein lacking an accessible RNA component. Purification of the alternative splicing factor indicates that the activity is contained in one of several possibly related polypeptides of 30-35 kd.

1855257|a|We described previously the purification of a human protein, called alternative splicing factor (ASF), that can switch utilization of alternative 5' splice sites in an SV40 early pre-mRNA. We now report the isolation of a cDNA, designated ASF-1, that encodes this protein. ASF-1 consists of 248 amino acid residues, including an 80 residue RNA-binding domain at its N-terminus and a 50 residue C-terminal region that is 80% serine plus arginine. ASF-1 produced in E. coli can activate splicing in vitro and switch 5' splice-site utilization, establishing that the recombinant protein is sufficient to supply these activities. Analysis of additional cDNAs revealed that ASF pre-mRNA can itself be alternatively spliced, surprisingly, by utilization of a shared 5' splice site and two closely spaced 3' splice sites. Use of the upstream site results in a second mRNA (ASF-2) in which translation of the downstream exon occurs extensively in an alternative reading frame distinct from ASF-1.

1906035|a|The polypyrimidine tract of mammalian introns is recognized by a 62-kD protein (pPTB). Mutations in the polypyrimidine tract that reduce the binding of pPTB also reduce the efficiency of formation of the pre-spliceosome complex containing U2 snRNP. The PTB protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on a matrix containing poly(U), and peptide sequence was used to isolate several cDNAs. Because a variety of cell types express mRNA complementary to these cDNAs, PTB may be a ubiquitous splicing factor. Three classes of cDNAs were identified, on the basis of the presence of additional sequences at an internal position. This variation in sequence probably reflects alternative splicing of the PTB pre-mRNA and produces mRNAs encoding the prototype PTB protein, a form of PTB protein containing 19 additional residues, and a truncated form of PTB protein with a novel carboxyl terminus. A murine homolog of pPTB has been characterized previously as a DNA-binding protein. Sequence comparisons indicate that pPTB is distantly related to the hnRNP L protein and that these two proteins should be considered as members of a novel family of RNA-binding proteins.

2493992|a|The D. melanogaster transformer-2 (tra-2) gene regulates somatic sexual differentiation in females and is necessary for spermatogenesis in males. Wild-type tra-2 function is required for the female-specific splicing of the pre-mRNA of the next known gene (doublesex) downstream of tra-2 in the sex determination regulatory hierarchy. The tra-2 gene was cloned, and P element-mediated transformation was used to demonstrate that a 3.9 kb genomic fragment contains all sequences necessary for tra-2 function. A 1.7 kb transcript was shown to be the product of the tra-2 locus based on its reduced level in flies containing a tra-2 mutant allele. The sequence of a cDNA corresponding to this transcript indicates that it encodes a polypeptide with strong similarity to a family of RNA binding proteins that includes proteins found associated with hnRNPs and snRNPs, suggesting that the tra-2 product may directly regulate the processing of the double-sex pre-mRNA in females.

1853200|a|The removal of introns from eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors shares mechanistic characteristics with the self-splicing of certain introns, prompting speculation that the catalytic reactions of nuclear pre-messenger RNA splicing are fundamentally RNA-based. The participation of five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in splicing is now well documented. Genetic analysis in yeast has revealed the requirement, in addition, for several dozen proteins. Some of these are tightly bound to snRNAs to form small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs); such proteins may promote interactions between snRNAs or between an snRNA and the intron. Other, non-snRNP proteins appear to associate transiently with the spliceosome. Some of these factors, which include RNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatases, may promote the accurate recognition of introns.

1658620|a|Adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA was used as a model to examine alternative 5' splice site selection during in vitro splicing reactions. Strong preference for the downstream 13S 5' splice site over the upstream 12S or 9S 5' splice sites was observed. However, the 12S 5' splice site was used efficiently when a mutant pre-mRNA lacking the 13S 5' splice site was processed, and 12S splicing from this substrate was not reduced by 13S splicing from a separate pre-mRNA, demonstrating that 13S splicing reduced 12S 5' splice site selection through a bona fide cis-competition. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of nuclear extract yielded two fractions with different splicing activities. The bound fraction contained all components required for efficient splicing of simple substrates but was unable to utilize alternative 5' splice sites. In contrast, the flow-through fraction, which by itself was inactive, contained an activity required for alternative splicing and was shown to stimulate 12S and 9S splicing, while reducing 13S splicing, when added to reactions carried out by the bound fraction. Furthermore, the activity, which we have called distal splicing factor (DSF), enhanced utilization of an upstream 5' splice site on a simian virus 40 early pre-mRNA, suggesting that the factor acts in a position-dependent, substrate-independent fashion. Several lines of evidence are presented suggesting that DSF is a non-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein protein. Finally, we describe a functional interaction between DSF and ASF, a protein that enhances use of downstream 5' splice sites.

1535526|a|The effects of human alternative splicing factor, ASF, on in vitro splicing of adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA were examined. E1A pre-mRNA is a complex substrate, and splicing in HeLa cell nuclear extracts produces six different RNAs using three alternative 5' splice sites and two 3' splice sites. Addition of excess ASF to splicing reactions produced a simplified splicing pattern, in which only one spliced product, 13S RNA, was detected. Inhibition of 12S and 9S splicing, which use 5' splice sites upstream of the 13S 5' splice site, extends previous observations that when multiple 5' splice sites compete for the same 3' splice site, ASF causes preferential selection of the proximal 5' splice site. However, inhibition of the other splices, which use a different upstream 3' splice site, represents a novel activity of ASF, as competition between 5' splice sites is not involved. The effect of ASF on 12S splicing was found to depend on its position relative to competing 5' splice sites, indicating that the ability of ASF to activate proximal 5' splice sites is position- but not sequence-dependent. Finally, addition of small amounts of ASF to ASF-lacking S100 extract was able to activate distal as well as proximal 5' splice sites in two of three pre-mRNAs tested, indicating that in these cases changes in the concentration of ASF alone can be sufficient to modulate alternative 5' splice site selection.

The U1 RNA-binding domain of the A protein component of the human U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which encompasses the RRM sequence, was analyzed by using NMR spectroscopy. The domain of the A protein is a highly stable monomer in solution consisting of four antiparallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices. The highly conserved RNP1 and RNP2 consensus sequences, containing residues previously suggested to be involved in nucleic acid binding, are juxtaposed in adjacent beta-strands. Conserved aromatic side chains that are critical for RNA binding are clustered on the surface of the molecule adjacent to a variable loop that influences recognition of specific RNA sequences. The secondary structure and topology of the RRM are similar to those of ribosomal proteins L12 and L30, suggesting a distant evolutionary relationship between these two types of RNA-associated proteins.

UV-crosslinking experiments revealed that both female-specific transformer (tra) and transformer-2 (tra-2) products bind to the 13-nucleotide sequences of dsx pre-mRNA. These results strongly suggest that the female-specific splicing of dsx pre-mRNA is activated by binding of these proteins to the 13-nucleotide sequences.

The predicted amino acid sequence of rbp1 is similar to those of the human splicing factor ASF/SF2, the Drosophila nuclear phosphoprotein SRp55, and the Drosophila puff-associated protein B52. Northern and immunohistochemical analyses showed that rbp1 is expressed at all stages in all tissues and that the RBP1 protein is localized to the nucleus. Consistent with a role in mRNA metabolism, indirect immunofluorescence reveals that the RBP1 protein colocalizes with RNA polymerase II on larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes. RBP1 protein made in Escherichia coli was tested for splicing activity using human cell extracts in which ASF has been shown previously both to activate splicing and to affect the choice of splice sites in alternatively spliced pre-mRNAs. In these assays, RBP1 protein, like ASF, is capable of both activating splicing and switching splice site selection. However, in each case, clear differences in the behavior of the two proteins were detected, suggesting that they have related but not identical functions. The general nuclear expression pattern, colocalization on chromosomes with RNA polymerase II, the similarity to ASF/SF2, SRp55, and B52, along with the effect on alternative splicing shown in vitro, suggest that rbp1 is involved in the processing of precursor mRNAs.

Splicing factor 1 (SF1) is sensitive to micrococcal nuclease, and appears to consist of at least U1 and U2 snRNPs, since splicing is inhibited when the 5' termini of U1 and U2 snRNAs are removed by site-directed cleavage with RNAase H. SF2 is a micrococcal nuclease-resistant factor present in the nuclear extract but absent from an S100 extract. SF3 is a factor that can be preferentially inactivated by moderate heat treatment. Two additional factors (SF4A and SF4B) were identified by fractionation of the nuclear extract using spermine-agarose and CM-sepharose chromatography. SF1, SF2, and SF4B appear to be required for cleavage of the pre-mRNA at the 5' splice site and lariat formation, whereas SF3 and SF4A are only required for cleavage at the 3' splice site and exon ligation.

The purest fraction contains only two related polypeptides of 33 kD. This fraction is sufficient to complement an S100 fraction, which contains the remaining splicing factors, to splice several pre-mRNAs. The optimal amount of SF2 required for efficient splicing depends on the pre-mRNA substrate. SF2 is distinct from the hnRNP A1 and U1 snRNP a polypeptides, which are similar in size. Endogenous hnRNA copurifies with SF2, but this activity does not appear to have an essential RNA component. SF2 appear to be necessary for the assembly or stabilization of the earliest specific prespliceosome complex, although in the absence of other components, it can bind RNA in a nonspecific manner. SF2 copurifies with an activity that promotes the annealing of complementary RNAs. Thus, SF2 may promote specific RNA-RNA interactions between snRNAs and pre-mRNA, between complementary snRNA regions, and/or involving intramolecular pre-mRNA helices. Other purified proteins with RNA annealing activity cannot substitute for SF2 in the splicing reaction.

In addition to its essential role in constitutive splicing, SF2 can strongly influence 5' splice site selection. When pre-mRNAs containing multiple cis-competing 5' splice sites are spliced in vitro, high concentrations of purified SF2 promote the use of the 5' splice site closest to the 3' splice site. However, SF2 discriminates properly between authentic and cryptic splice sites. These effects of SF2 on splice site selection may reflect the cellular mechanisms that prevent exon skipping and ensure the accuracy of splicing. In addition, alterations in the concentration or activity of SF2, and of other general splicing factors, may serve to regulate alternative splicing in vivo.

Replacement with a 10 amino acid simple nuclear entry signal allows partial, inefficient function. Thus, the su(wa) RS domain apparently serves a generic function(s) subsuming nuclear entry. Moreover, immunocytochemical studies demonstrate that both RS domains specifically direct localization of a fused reporter protein to a punctate subnuclear compartment shown previously to be enriched in several constitutive splicing components. We propose that RS domains are a new class of targeting signals directing concentration of proteins in a subnuclear compartment implicated in splicing metabolism.

1340464|a|Unrelated factors collaborate at composite response elements to confer novel patterns of transcriptional regulation. For example, AP-1 and glucocorticoid receptor bind and mutually affect their activities at a 25-bp composite element, plfG. We found that different members of the AP-1 factor family that behave similarly in the absence of receptor are strikingly distinct in its presence: They specify opposite (enhancement vs. repression) regulatory actions by the receptor. Four amino acids within the AP-1 DNA-binding domain were identified as crucial determinants of receptor regulatory activity at plfG. We conclude that interactions of factors from separate transcription factor families at composite response elements provide a mechanism by which a single factor can regulate both positively or negatively, and a potential resolution of the apparent functional redundancy within regulatory factor families.

Wild-type protein as well as truncated versions carrying isolated single motifs or artificial combinations of two and more such elements were characterized for their ability to bind specifically to RNA homopolymers.

3036371|a|To explore the mechanism and control of alternative splicing, we have characterized the products formed by splicing of SV40 early pre-mRNA in vitro and in vivo. Large T and small t mRNAs are derived from this precursor by joining alternative 5' splice sites to a single shared 3' splice site. In contrast to pre-mRNAs studied previously, we have shown that splicing to large T RNA involves the utilization of multiple lariat branch sites, while small t splicing uses a single branch site. Interestingly, the predominant branch sites utilized in splicing of large T RNA in vitro were found to differ in nuclear extracts from HeLa and human 293 cells, correlated with previously observed differences in the ratio of large T to small t mRNAs produced in the two cell types. To test the significance of this correlation, we examined the products formed by splicing of an SV40 early precursor microinjected into X. laevis oocytes. Strikingly, both the pattern of branch sites used in large T splicing and the ratio of large T to small t mRNAs produced were found to be identical to those observed in 293 cells and extracts.

2850262|a|Splicing of SV40 early pre-mRNA to alternative large-T and small-t mRNAs involves the utilization of multiple lariat branch sites. To determine the functional significance of these sites, we constructed and analyzed a set of base substitution mutants in which the major branch acceptors were altered, either singly or in combination. The ratio of large-T to small-t mRNAs produced in vivo was found to vary by over 100-fold between different mutants. When splicing was assayed in vitro with a standard pre-RNA, which results in splicing almost exclusively to large-T mRNA, the patterns of branch site utilization were altered dramatically, although the mutations were essentially without effect on splicing efficiency. However, use of a 5' truncated pre-RNA, which results in a splicing pattern that reflects the in vivo alternative splicing potential of this pre-RNA, revealed a strong correlation between the effects of the base substitutions on branch site selection and alternative splice-site utilization. An RNase protection analysis of factor interactions with the 5' splice sites and branch sites in wild-type and mutant pre-RNAs suggests that a competition for different branch sites plays a crucial role in the assembly of 'alternative' spliceosomes, thereby controlling alternative splice-site selection.

1906035|a|The polypyrimidine tract of mammalian introns is recognized by a 62-kD protein (pPTB). Mutations in the polypyrimidine tract that reduce the binding of pPTB also reduce the efficiency of formation of the pre-spliceosome complex containing U2 snRNP. The PTB protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on a matrix containing poly(U), and peptide sequence was used to isolate several cDNAs. Because a variety of cell types express mRNA complementary to these cDNAs, PTB may be a ubiquitous splicing factor. Three classes of cDNAs were identified, on the basis of the presence of additional sequences at an internal position. This variation in sequence probably reflects alternative splicing of the PTB pre-mRNA and produces mRNAs encoding the prototype PTB protein, a form of PTB protein containing 19 additional residues, and a truncated form of PTB protein with a novel carboxyl terminus. A murine homolog of pPTB has been characterized previously as a DNA-binding protein. Sequence comparisons indicate that pPTB is distantly related to the hnRNP L protein and that these two proteins should be considered as members of a novel family of RNA-binding proteins.

8449401|a|Previously, we characterized cDNAs encoding polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and showed that a complex between PTB and a 100-kD protein was necessary for pre-mRNA splicing. In this paper we have used two different in vitro-binding assays to confirm and extend the interaction between these two proteins. Peptide sequence information was used to clone and sequence cDNAs encoding alternatively spliced forms of the 100-kD protein. It contains two consensus RNA-binding domains and an unusual amino terminus rich in proline and glutamine residues. The protein is highly basic and migrates anomalously on SDS gels. Owing to its interaction with PTB and its role in pre-mRNA splicing, we have termed the 100-kD protein PTB-associated splicing factor (PSF). The RNA-binding properties of PSF are apparently identical to those of PTB. Both proteins, together and independently, bind the polypyrimidine tract of mammalian introns. Biochemical complementation, antibody inhibition, and immunodepletion experiments demonstrate that PSF is an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor required early in spliceosome formation. Bacterially synthesized PSF is able to complement immunodepleted extracts and restore splicing activity. Despite association with PSF, complementary experiments with antibodies against PTB do not suggest an essential role for PTB in pre-mRNA splicing.

2467746|a|We have defined the RNA binding domain of the 70K protein component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein to a region of 111 amino acids. This domain encompasses an octamer sequence that has been observed in other proteins associated with RNA, but has not previously been shown to bind directly to a specific RNA sequence. Within the U1 RNA binding domain, an 80 amino acid consensus sequence that is conserved in many presumed RNA binding proteins was discerned. This sequence pattern appears to represent an RNA recognition motif (RRM) characteristic of a distinct family of proteins. By site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that the 70K protein consists of 437 amino acids (52 kd), and found that its aberrant electrophoretic migration is due to a carboxy-terminal charged domain structurally similar to two Drosophila proteins (su(wa) and tra) that may regulate alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing.

These studies also show that the proximity of the 5' and 3' splice sites is an important determinant in the selection of splice-sites. Deletion, substitution, or even subtle changes of exon sequences can alter the pattern of splice-site selection, and in many cases the splice site adjacent to the altered exon is not used. The relative use of the duplicated splice sites can also be altered by diluting the splicing extract, suggesting that factors involved in splice-site selection are limiting.

2963698|a|Pre-mRNA splicing complex assembly is mediated by two specific pre-mRNA-snRNP interactions: U1 snRNP binds to the 5' splice site and U2 snRNP binds to the branch point. Here we show that unlike a purified U1 snRNP, which can bind to a 5' splice site, a partially purified U2 snRNP cannot interact with its target pre-mRNA sequence. We identify a previously uncharacterized activity, U2AF, that is required for the U2 snRNP-branch point interaction and splicing complex formation. Using RNA substrate exclusion and competition assays, we demonstrate that U2AF binds to the 3' splice site region prior to the U2 snRNP-branch point interaction. This provides an explanation for the necessity of the 3' splice site region in U2 snRNP binding and, hence, the first step of splicing.

DNA sequence determination reveals four tandemly arrayed 90 amino acid regions of homology that probably represent poly(A)-binding domains. A 55 residue A-rich region upstream of the initiator methionine codon in the mRNA shows an affinity for poly(A)-binding protein comparable to that of poly(A)180-220, raising the possibility of feedback regulation of translation.

2145152|a|The U2 snRNP contains two specific proteins, U2B'' and U2A'. Neither of these proteins, on its own, is capable of specific interactions with U2 RNA. Here, a complex between U2B'' and U2A' that forms in the absence of RNA is identified. Analysis of mutant forms of U2B'' shows that the smallest fragment able to bind specifically U2 RNA (amino acids 1-88) is also the minimal region required for complex formation with U2A', and implies that this region must be largely structurally intact for U2A' interaction. Although this truncated U2B'' fragment is capable of making specific protein--RNA and protein-protein interactions its structure, as measured by the ability to bind to U2A'', appears to depend on the rest of the protein. Hybrids between U2B'' and the closely related U1A protein are used to localize U2B'' specific amino acids involved in protein-protein interaction. These can be divided into two functional groups. U2A' interaction with U2B'' amino acids 37-46 permits binding to U2 RNA whereas interaction with U2B'' specific amino acids between positions 14 and 25 reduces non-specific binding to U1 RNA. These two proteins may serve as a general example of how RNA binding may be modulated by protein-protein interaction in the assembly of RNPs, particularly since the region of U2'' involved in interaction with U2A' consists mainly of a conserved RNP motif.

1385725|a|The hnRNP C1 and C2 proteins are abundant nuclear proteins that bind avidly to heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs) and appear to be involved with pre-mRNA processing. The RNA-binding activity of the hnRNP C proteins is contained in the amino-terminal 94 amino acid RNA-binding domain (RBD) that is identical for these two proteins. We have obtained the 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR assignments for the RBD of the human hnRNP C proteins. The assignment process was facilitated by extensive utilization of three- and four-dimensional heteronuclear-edited spectra. Sequential assignments of the backbone resonances were made using a combination of 15N-edited 3D NOESY-HMQC, 3D TOCSY-HMQC, and 3D TOCSY-NOESY-HSQC as well as 3D HNCA, HNCO, and HCACO spectra. Side-chain resonances were assigned using 3D HCCH-COSY and 3D HCH-TOCSY spectra. Four-dimensional 13C/13C-edited NOESY and 13C/15N-edited NOESY experiments were used to unambigously resolve NOEs. The overall global folding pattern was established by calculating a set of preliminary structures using constraints derived from the sequential NOEs and a small number of long-range NOEs.

8332490|a|The U1 snRNP-specific 70K protein is one of the few snRNP proteins from higher eukaryotic cells that is phosphorylated in vivo (1,2). Immunoaffinity purified spliceosomal snRNPs (U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6) were tested for their ability to phosphorylate in vitro the U1-specific 70K protein. An snRNP-associated kinase activity which phosphorylates all U1-70K isoelectric variants was identified. Like its in vivo counterpart, this snRNP-associated enzyme phosphorylates solely serine residues of the 70K protein, preferentially utilizing ATP as a phosphodonor. Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis revealed an overlapping set of at least four radiolabeled peptides in the in vivo and in vitro phosphorylated protein, suggesting that the snRNP-associated serine kinase is responsible, at least in part, for the 70K protein phosphorylation observed in vivo. Chymotryptic digestion of in vitro, 32P-labeled 70K protein and in vitro phosphorylation studies with a synthetic peptide, indicated that the multiple 70K phosphorylation sites are limited to a highly charged, C-terminal domain of the protein. In vitro phosphorylation studies with the splicing factor ASF/SF2 and several deletion mutants demonstrated that, similar to the U1-70K protein, the snRNP-associated serine kinase phosphorylates the carboxy terminal RS-rich domain of ASF/SF2. A potential general role for this enzyme in the phosphorylation of splicing factors and its consequences for pre-mRNA splicing regulation are discussed.

2531895|a|Binding of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) to the pre-mRNA branch site is an early step in spliceosome assembly and appears to commit a pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway. We have shown previously that this ATP-dependent binding requires a non-rnRNP factor, U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF), in addition to U2 snRNP. In this report we have identified U2AF, purified it to homogeneity, and characterized its biochemical properties. Purified U2AF comprises roughly equimolar quantities of two polypeptides, approximately 65 kDa and approximately 35 kDa, which appear to be associated. Measured by ultraviolet crosslinking, the 65-kDa polypeptide binds specifically to the polypyrimidine tract/3' splice site region. U2AF binds rapidly at 4 degrees C in the absence of ATP and remains associated with the pre-mRNA following U2 snRNP binding. Thus, the simple binding of U2AF initiates mammalian spliceosome assembly by facilitating the ATP-dependent binding of U2 snRNP.

6691261|a|Percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) was performed in 23 consecutive patients with valvular aortic stenosis with no associated cardiac defects. The patients were 2 to 17 years old and were referred from 12 hospitals in 4 states. The balloon was positioned across the aortic valve and inflated to pressures of 80, 100, then 120 psi. Each inflation lasted 5 to 10 seconds. The arterial and venous catheters were connected together outside the groin to avoid excessive increase in left ventricular pressure during total aortic valve occlusion with the inflated balloon. Peak systolic aortic valve pressure gradient and cardiac output were measured before and 15 minutes after BAV. There was no significant change in cardiac output, but all patients had a lessened gradient. The gradient before BAV was 113 +/- 48 mm Hg, decreasing to 32 +/- 15 mm Hg after BAV (p less than 0.01). The left ventricular peak systolic pressure decreased from 221 +/- 54 to 149 +/- 21 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). No aortic regurgitation was noted in 13 patients and very mild aortic regurgitation was noted in 10 patients after BAV. The balloons were 10 to 20 mm in diameter, chosen at least 1 mm smaller than the diameter of the aortic valve anulus. Pressures of 100 to 120 psi were required to achieve full inflation of the balloons. Six patients had repeat cardiac catheterization studies 3 to 9 months after BAV. In none was there a significant change in peak systolic aortic valve pressure gradient or cardiac output compared with the study immediately after valvuloplasty.

Valvuloplasty was successful in 192 of 204 children, reducing the peak systolic left ventricular ejection gradient from 77 +/- 2 to 30 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001. The same degree of aortic stenosis gradients reduction was noted in both the 38 children under 1 year of age and in the 166 children over 1 year of age. Significant complications included death, aortic regurgitation and femoral artery thrombosis or damage. The incidence of these complications correlated with the age of the child, the ratio of valvuloplasty balloon size/anulus size, or both. The data suggest that percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty provides effective acute relief of valvar aortic stenosis in both infants and children. However, long-term follow-up data are necessary before balloon valvuloplasty can be established as a treatment of choice for congenital valvar aortic stenosis.

3657253|a|The factors associated with survival in 40 neonates (age less than 28 days) with critical aortic stenosis undergoing either open (22 patients) or closed (18 patients) transventricular aortic valvotomy were reviewed. Significant adverse correlates with survival included evidence of poor perfusion preoperatively (low pH, greater than Grade 2/6 soft ejection systolic murmur) and marked congestive heart failure (hepatomegaly, cardiomegaly, elevated left atrial pressure). Congenital mitral stenosis (anulus less than 11 mm), a small aortic anulus (less than 6.5 mm), and failure to achieve an adequate aortic orifice (greater than 6 mm), at operation were identified as factors associated with increased mortality. Initial perioperative survival was better with closed aortic valvotomy. However, there was no significant difference in overall operative survival between closed (9/18, 50%) and open (8/22, 36%) aortic valvotomy (p = 0.26). The incidence of early reoperation (less than 1 year of age) was greater in perioperative survivors undergoing closed valvotomy (7/13, 54%) rather than open valvotomy (1/10, 10%) (p less than 0.05).

3365044|a|Congenital aortic stenosis presenting within the first 6 months of life is a highly lethal anomaly. Although aortic valvotomy has offered excellent palliation in many instances, the operative risk remains substantial. To better understand the factors associated with a poor operative result, the records of all patients less than 6 months of age undergoing aortic valvotomy at our institution from 1972 through 1986 were analyzed. Nineteen patients (58%) (Group I) survived operation; 14 (42%) (Group II) died. The following variables were analyzed in an attempt to define those with prognostic significance: mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), left ventricular (LV) peak systolic pressure, LV end-diastolic pressure, peak systolic aortic valve gradient, LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV ejection fraction, and age at operation. The only variables that were significantly different in the two groups were mean PA (Group I, 29 +/- 3 mm Hg, and Group II, 54 +/- 3 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) and LVEDV (Group I, 50 +/- 8 ml/m2, and Group II, 20 +/- 4 ml/m2; p less than 0.05). No patient with an LVEDV of 20 ml/m2 or less survived operation. We conclude that small LV dimension and elevation of PAP may be predictive of a poor surgical result in patients with severe aortic stenosis presenting in infancy.

2713192|a|Between April 1974 and December 1987, 20 infants (six under one month of age) (mean weight 4.9 kg) underwent surgical valvotomy for critical aortic stenosis. Three of the four patients treated before 1976 died. Since 1979, 16 infants (four neonates) have undergone valvotomy with no deaths. Mortality for the whole group was 15%; in the neonates it was 33%. There were no late deaths. The survivors were followed up for a mean of 3 years 9 months and two required re-operations. The considerable improvement in surgical results in the past decade should be taken into account when newer techniques such as balloon dilatation are evaluated.

2310642|a|Over a 5 year period open valvotomy was performed on 13 patients under the age of one year with critical aortic stenosis. All 13 survived operation. There were two late deaths--one 38 days after operation, associated with an unrelated neurosurgical procedure and the other 2 years 6 months after when aortic root enlargement and replacement of the aortic valve were performed. During this period two other infants presented with aortic stenosis. One, who was very ill before transfer, died before operation could be performed. The second patient had a hypoplastic left ventricle with a small mitral valve ring and was, therefore, considered to be part of a different subgroup. All the surviving children have been followed up (median length of follow up 2 years and 11 months, range 7 months-5 years). Left ventricular function, in terms of percentage systolic wall thickening, was shown to be significantly impaired in all age groups. Peak diastolic thinning was abnormal in those children aged from 3 to 5. The aortic valve gradient, as assessed by peak instantaneous continuous wave Doppler, was less than 40 mm Hg in five patients and between 40 and 70 mm Hg in seven patients. One patient, with appreciable restenosis, has undergone successful percutaneous balloon dilatation of the aortic valve.

2007718|a|Between 1986 and July 1990, balloon valvuloplasty was attempted in eight newborns (less than 28 days of age) with isolated critical aortic valve stenosis. Balloon valvuloplasty could not be successfully accomplished in any of the three infants presenting before 1989. Since March 1989, when improved catheter technology became available, all five neonates presenting with critical aortic stenosis were treated successfully by balloon valvuloplasty. A transumbilical approach was utilized in all four infants in whom umbilical artery access could be obtained. One newborn who was 25 days of age underwent transfemoral balloon valvuloplasty. Balloon valvuloplasty was immediately successful in all five newborns, as evidenced by a decrease in valve gradient and improvement in left ventricular function and cardiac output. Peak systolic gradient was reduced by 64% from 69 +/- 8 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg (p = 0.005). Left ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 128 +/- 9 to 95 +/- 9 mm Hg (p = 0.02) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 20 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 1 mm Hg (p = 0.02). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation was documented in two infants after valvuloplasty. The time from first catheter insertion to valve dilation averaged 57 +/- 14 min (range 26 to 94) and the median length of the hospital stay was 4 days. With the use of recently available catheters, the transumbilical technique of balloon valvuloplasty can be performed quickly, safely and effectively in the newborn with critical aortic stenosis. It does not require general anesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass or a left ventricular apical incision and it preserves the femoral arteries for future transcatheter intervention should significant aortic stenosis recur.

3426897|a|Percutaneous balloon dilatation of severe aortic valve stenosis was attempted in thirteen patients (seven neonates and six infants). In two the valve could not be crossed and both died during subsequent operation. Two patients died during manipulation of the balloon catheter. No significant benefit was obtained in another patient who later died during operation. Balloon dilatation was successful in the remaining eight patients, reducing the aortic valve pressure gradient from a mean of 63 mmHg (95% confidence interval 38 to 88 mmHg) to a mean of 23 mmHg (95% confidence interval 7 to 39 mmHg). Two of these patients subsequently died from heart failure related to other cardiac lesions. The six survivors have done well. At follow up the maximum Doppler velocities in the ascending aorta ranged from 1.9 to 4.0 m/s after 2-23 months, but despite this evidence of an increasing valve gradient there has been lasting clinical improvement.

2926060|a|Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty was attempted in 10 newborn infants with critical aortic valve stenosis and severe congestive heart failure. Three had a very small left ventricle and aortic anulus. In one infant, the aortic valve could not be passed, and in another infant, a technical error resulted in severe valvular damage, aortic insufficiency and death. Among the eight patients who had effective dilation, the stenosis was relieved in seven as assessed by a significant decrease in transvalvular pressure gradient, improvement of left ventricular contraction and eventual inversion of the ductal shunting. The procedure failed in the only patient whose dilation was performed with an undersized balloon. Aortic insufficiency occurred in three infants and was severe (perforated cusp) in one, moderate in one whose valve was dilated with an excessively large balloon and mild and transient in one. None of the three infants with a very small left ventricle recovered (two died and one underwent cardiac transplantation). Among the seven infants with a left ventricle of acceptable size, three underwent subsequent aortic valvotomy; one of these died and two bad good results. The remaining four are doing well 16 +/- 5 months later (mean +/- SD) with mild to moderate residual aortic stenosis and normal left ventricular function. In conclusion, percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is an acceptable alternative to surgery in neonates with critical aortic valve stenosis. Incidence of complications and good relief of the obstruction depend on a careful technique. Immediate results are similar to those of surgery. Late prognosis depends on the quality of the left heart structures.

2791246|a|Balloon aortic valvotomy (BAV) is an alternative to surgical valvotomy in infants and children. We compared BAV in 16 consecutive neonates (1985-1988) to surgical valvotomy in a prior group of 16 consecutive neonates (1978-1984). Both groups were comparable in terms of age, weight, hemodynamic data, left ventricular size, and associated lesions. There were six early and one late deaths after surgery. Five out of six neonates requiring a second operation died. Left ventricular size (measured in 13 neonates) had some influence on survival after surgery: three of three with small or hypoplastic left ventricles and three of 10 with normal-sized left ventricles died. After BAV, there were three early deaths, two patients who underwent stage I palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and two late deaths. As with surgical valvotomy, left ventricular size seemed to influence survival after BAV: five of six with small or hypoplastic left ventricles died or underwent stage I palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome and two of nine with normal-sized left ventricles died. At follow-up (26 +/- 17 months) in six patients in the surgical group, the peak systolic ejection gradient (PSEG) was 52.2 +/- 23 mm Hg and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) 18.2 +/- 5.2 mm Hg. Aortic regurgitation was mild in five and moderate in the sixth patient. At follow-up (17.6 +/- 7.8 months) in nine patients in the balloon dilation group, the PSEG was 45.6 +/- 11 mm Hg in five patients at catheterization and 43.8 +/- 22.9 mm Hg in four patients by echocardiography-Doppler. Aortic regurgitation was mild in three and absent in the other six patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

2345246|a|Balloon valvuloplasty in neonates with severe aortic valve stenosis is limited by difficulties in catheter manipulation around the arch and across the valve and by the risk of femoral artery complications. A right common carotid artery cutdown was utilized for balloon aortic valvuloplasty in five neonates 1 to 20 days of age, weighing 3.1 to 3.9 kg. Standard balloon valvuloplasty was performed through a 6F sheath inserted in the right carotid artery. The arteriotomy was repaired at the end of the procedure. Mean left ventricular systolic pressure was reduced from 142 to 97 mm Hg, with a decrease in mean peak systolic pressure gradient from 76 to 33 mm Hg. Only one patient developed mild aortic regurgitation. One patient with a hypoplastic left ventricle died, and one patient required open valvotomy. All four survivors have a normal carotid pulse and no neurologic sequelae. Two of these patients required repeat balloon dilation to treat residual aortic valve stenosis at 8 and 10 months of age, respectively. Balloon valvuloplasty using a carotid artery approach is feasible and was safe in five neonates with severe aortic valve stenosis.

1959189|a|Failure of infants with critical aortic stenosis to survive after adequate valvotomy despite a left ventricular size that appears to be adequate indicates that additional preoperative anatomic features may contribute to mortality.Discriminant analysis was used to determine which of several echocardiographically measured left heart structures were independent predictors of survival after valvotomy for neonatal critical aortic stenosis. It was possible to predict outcome after classic valvotomy (two-ventricle-type repair) with 95% accuracy based on mitral valve area, long-axis dimension of the left ventricle relative to the long-axis dimension of the heart, diameter of the aortic root, and body surface area. Left ventricular volume was not a major determinant in this study, in part because patients who had initial valvotomy had been preselected in favor of an adequately sized left ventricle. Patients with multiple small left ventricular structures were found to have significantly improved survival after initial Norwood operation. In contrast, balloon valvotomy with subsequent Norwood procedure was usually unsuccessful.The adverse effects of small inflow, outflow, and/or cavity size of the left ventricle are cumulative. The accuracy of prediction of outcome based only on preoperative anatomy indicates that adequacy of valvotomy is not generally a limiting factor for survival in this group of patients. It is possible to identify subjects whose chance of survival is better after a Norwood procedure rather than valvotomy, even if left ventricular volume is not critically small.

Using a group reversal design, rates of interaction were measured. In addition, the vocal content of the interactions was recorded and coded by raters blind to condition. Rates of interaction more than doubled during the treatment phases, but ineffective vocal behavior accounted for the bulk of the increase.

The questionnaire items included personal efficacy, perceived motivators and barriers, and current practices related to the compliance of each of the dietary guidelines. The distributions of responses to the questionnaire items show variations in the subjects' attitudes, beliefs and current dietary practices related to each of the dietary guidelines. Most subjects reported current practice of most guidelines except the guideline of a low fat diet. Most of the time, the subjects perceived one or more motivations to comply with the guidelines of eating fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C, and eating dark green or deep yellow vegetables. Taste and health benefits were shown to be important factors among motivators influencing the compliance to the dietary guidelines. The findings of this exploratory study have direct implications for planning nutrition intervention programs for cancer risk reduction in the elderly.

3510241|a|Cardiovascular disease, so common in the elderly, has become an urgent public health concern. Major contributing factors include hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, physical indolence, and cigarette smoking. Diet plays a major role in atherogenesis by its influence in blood lipids, blood pressure, and glucose tolerance, although its impact in the elderly is speculative owing to a paucity of direct evidence. But a rationale exists. Most cardiovascular risk factors are more prevalent in the elderly than in the young adult. The rise in blood pressure and blood lipids with advancing age is not inevitable. Diet may contribute to hypertension through an excess of calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, or salt and a deficiency of potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Antiatherogenic diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol, rich in fiber, and with substitution of polyunsaturated fat and restricted calories tend to normalize serum lipids and to cause lesions to involute. Emphasis on vegetable protein and fiber-rich food has merit because they provide more fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids, magnesium, selenium, complex carbohydrate, potassium, and copper, and less cholesterol, saturated fat, and sodium. The recommended fat-modified diets are adequate in protein, vitamins, and minerals and need not be deficient in any nutrient or economically nonfeasible. The accelerating decline in cardiovascular mortality, which has included the elderly, indicates that such disease is controllable and not inevitable, even in the elderly. The decrease has occurred concurrently with reduced consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol, increased use of vegetable oils, and improved levels of cardiovascular risk factors.

7057126|a|A discriminative stimulus is a stimulus condition which, (1) given the momentary effectiveness of some particular type of reinforcement (2) increases the frequency of a particular type of response (3) because that stimulus condition has been correlated with an increase in the frequency with which that type of response has been followed by that type of reinforcement. Operations such as deprivation have two different effects on behavior. One is to increase the effectiveness of some object or event as reinforcement, and the other is to evoke the behavior that has in the past been followed by that object or event. "Establishing operation" is suggested as a general term for operations having these two effects. A number of situations involve what is generally assumed to be a discriminative stimulus relation, but with the third defining characteristic of the discriminative stimulus absent. Here the stimulus change functions more like an establishing operation than a discriminative stimulus, and the new term, "establishing stimulus," is suggested. There are three other possible approaches to this terminological problem, but none are entirely satisfactory.

2221569|a|This article reviews past research and projects future research directions regarding women's health. Sex differences in mortality and morbidity, along with evidence that the quality and quantity of these differences are changing, are examined. Over the past decade, concurrent with dramatic changes in lifestyle and social roles for women, mortality rates have shifted, resulting in a decreasing advantage for women. Explaining the consequences of these dynamic changes requires understanding the health effects of such variables as perceived control, the experience of life roles, perceived and actual social support, and redefinition of gender roles. The future portends additional changes that will significantly affect women's health. In establishing an explicit psychological research agenda on women's health, (a) general recommendations for research are provided and (b) important issues that have not yet received a great deal of research attention (e.g., women and AIDS, psychopharmacology, reproductive technologies) are highlighted. This article expands the current discourse in health psychology and raises a number of issues for serious consideration.

3122028|a|In Drosophila tissue culture cells, the synthesis of ribosomal proteins was inhibited by a 1-h 37 degrees C heat shock. Ribosomal protein synthesis was repressed to a greater extent than that of most other proteins synthesized by these cells at 25 degrees C. After a 1-h heat shock, when the cells were returned to 25 degrees C, the ribosomal proteins were much slower than most other 25 degrees C proteins to return to pre-heat shock levels of synthesis. Relative to one another, all the ribosomal proteins were inhibited and later recovered to normal levels of synthesis at the same rate and to the same extent. Unlike the ribosomal proteins, the precursor to the large rRNAs was continually synthesized during heat shock, although at a slightly reduced level, but was not processed. It was rapidly degraded, with a half-life of approximately 16 min. Pre-heat shock levels of synthesis, stability, and correct processing were restored only when ribosomal protein synthesis returned to at least 50% of that seen in non-heat-shocked cells.

825231|a|The intact interphase genome of Drosophila melanogaster has been isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation after gentle lysis of tissue culture cells in 0.9 M NaCl-0.4% nonidet P40. The non-viscous folded DNA sediments as a single broad 5000S peak in a complex with RNA (a fraction of the nuclear nascent RNA) and protein (all of the four intranuclesome histones: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The folded DNA is supercoiled and can be relaxed to slower sedimenting forms either by intercalating ethidium or by nicking with DNAase I. Incomplete DNAase treatment gives partially relaxed complexes, indicating that each nick relaxes only a stretch of DNA (defined as a supercoiled DNA loop) without affecting the superhelical content of the rest of the genome. The concentration of superhelices in the Drosophila folded DNA is the same as in the E. coli and SV40 closed circular DNAs-that is, about one negative turn every 200 base pairs (bp) in 0.15 M NaCl at 26 degrees C. The estimated average size of the supercoiled DNA loops, about 85,000 bp, equals the size of the larger Drosophila chromomeres. Ethidium intercalation in 0.9 M NaCl both removes the negative superhelical turns and dissociates the four histones from the DNA. The four histones are dissociated in equimolar concentrations, and the relative proportion of histones displaced from the DNA is a function of ethidium concentration. The histones are completely dissociated from the folded DNA at the ethidium concentration. The histones are completely dissociated from the folded DNA at the ethidium concentration which removes all of the negative superhelices. Thus the data strongly suggest that the rotation of the Watson Crick helix which accompanies ethidium intercalation causes the loss of nucleosomes from the DNA. The results are interpreted in terms of a model for the folded Drosophila genome which has the DNA constrained (by both protein-DNA and RNA- DNA interactions) into independent supercoiled loops containing on the average 400 nucleosomes per loop. Each nucleosome is composed of a histone core with the DNA wound around it in a 360 degrees left-handed toroidal supercoil; each nucleosome toroidal supercoil plus its relaxed internucleosome DNA contains, on the average, 200 bp.

2840207|a|Studies with yeast DNA topoisomerase mutants indicate that neither topoisomerase I nor II appears to be essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II. However, plasmids carrying transcriptionally active genes are found to be extremely negatively supercoiled when isolated from mutants lacking topoisomerase I. Supercoiling occurs during transcriptional elongation rather than during transcriptional activation. It takes place in the absence of topoisomerase I and does not seem to be dependent on topoisomerase II since it can occur at the nonpermissive temperature in a top1-top2 ts mutant. Whether this change in linking number is due to an unusual form of topoisomerase II or whether it is due to a new enzyme has yet to be determined. The results suggest that topoisomerase I is normally required to relax transcriptionally induced supercoils. A model is discussed which considers the role of topoisomerases in the movement of RNA polymerase along the DNA template.

3022129|a|We investigated in detail the structural changes that occur in nuclear chromatin upon activation of the four small heat shock protein genes in D. melanogaster. Both the chemical cleavage reagent methidiumpropyl-EDTA X iron(II) [MPE X Fe(II)] and the nuclease DNase I revealed a complex pattern of four or five hypersensitive sites upstream of each gene before activation. In addition, MPE X Fe(II) detected a short positioned array of nucleosomes located on each coding region. Upon heat shock activation a number of changes in the patterns occurred. For each gene, at least one of the upstream hypersensitive regions was eliminated or substantially shifted in position. Regions were established which became highly refractile to digestion by either MPE X Fe(II) or DNase I and, as such, appeared as small "footprints" in the pattern. The location of these refractile regions relative to the cap site varied for each gene examined. The coding regions themselves became highly accessible to DNase I. The nucleosomal arrays detected by MPE X Fe(II) were characterized by a considerable loss of detail and significantly enhanced accessibility, the extent of which probably reflected the relative transcription rate of each gene. Careful mapping of the location and extent of each upstream footprint and comparison with the DNA sequence revealed the presence at each location of two (or more) contiguous or overlapping segments that bear high homology to the heat shock consensus sequence C-T-N-G-A-A-N-N-T-T-C-N-A-G.

1885003|a|We have used indirect immunofluorescence of polytene chromosomes to examine the chromatin distribution of a 52-kD Drosophila protein designated B52. B52 is localized to transcriptionally active loci and, at the highly decondensed heat shock loci, can be seen to bracket the RNA polymerase II fluorescence signals symmetrically. We have also examined the distribution of B52 on nonpolytene chromosomes in Drosophila cell cultures with an in vivo UV cross-linking method and find that, here too, B52 is associated with boundaries of transcriptionally active chromatin. The predicted primary amino acid sequence of B52 reveals two regions with similarities to a number of other proteins known to interact with nucleic acids.

1717265|a|Nucleosomes were assembled on a plasmid carrying a Xenopus somatic 5S RNA gene prepared at different superhelix densities. The gene was preferentially assembled into a positioned nucleosome which was stable to superhelical stress. No evidence for a conformational change in the nucleosome was found, even under extreme negative superhelical stress. Transcription in an extract from Xenopus oocyte nuclei was repressed to a degree which depended on the number of nucleosomes assembled. Topoisomerase activity in the extract was effectively inhibited by camptothecin, which had no effect on transcription. Transcription of reconstitutes remained repressed relative to naked plasmids, and was independent of superhelix density. Transcripts from reconstitutes were derived solely from nucleosome-free genes. Thus, a histone octamer positioned on the gene was sufficient to block its transcription. Tryptic removal of the core histone tail domains had no effect on transcription at any superhelix density. Transcription of reconstitutes containing H3/H4 tetramers was also repressed, but not eliminated (unlike reconstitutes containing octamers), and repression was independent of superhelix density. We suggest that removal of histones H2A/H2B from the nucleosome facilitates activation of transcription in the extract. We conclude that superhelical stress alone does not activate transcription of a 5S RNA gene assembled into a nucleosome in vitro.

2768190|a|In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, the enzyme DNA gyrase has been implicated in the expression of genes for anaerobic metabolic processes such as nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis. To assess the involvement of supercoiling in anaerobic gene expression, we have developed an assay to detect in vivo changes in superhelicity of small regions of the bacterial chromosome. Our method is based on the preferential intercalaction of psoralen into supercoiled versus relaxed DNA, and we have demonstrated the sensitivity of the assay in vivo on chromosomal regions from 2 to 10 kilobases in size. In experiments with inhibitors of gyrase, the reactivity of individual chromosomal fragments to psoralen decreases by a factor of 1.8 compared with DNA from control cultures. We used our assay to determine whether there is a change in superhelicity near the genes coding for essential proteins for photosynthesis upon a shift from respiratory to anaerobic photosynthetic growth. For comparison, we also examined a restriction fragment containing the fbc operon, which codes for the subunits of cytochrome bc1, a membrane-bound electron transport complex utilized during both aerobic and anaerobic photosynthetic growth. During this shift in growth conditions, the puf and puh mRNAs, coding for structural polypeptides of the photosynthetic apparatus, underwent a six- to eightfold induction, while the amount of mRNA from the fbc locus remained constant. However, we detected no change in the superhelicity of either the genes for photosynthesis or those for the bc1 complex during this metabolic transition. Our data thus do not support a model in which stable changes in chromosomal superhelicity regulate anaerobic gene expression. We suggest instead that the requirement for DNA gyrase in the transcription of photosynthesis genes results from the requirement for a swivel near heavily transcribed regions of the chromosome.

1033937|a|We have investigated DNA superstructure in a wide range of nuclei of higher cells by gently lysing cells to release structures that resemble nuclei but are depleted of nuclear proteins. The sedimentation properties of these structures, which we call nucleoids, have been examined in sucrose gradients containing the intercalating agent, ethidium. The sedimentation rate of nucleoids derived from the growing cells of mammals, birds, amphibians and insects varies in the manner characteristic of circular and superhelical molecules of DNA. These characteristic changes in sedimentation rate are abolished by irradiating the nucleoids with low doses of gamma-rays, a procedure known to introduce single-strand scissions into DNA. We have also investigated by similar means DNA superstructure in nucleoids derived from a variety of different chick cells. Nucleoids derived from adult hen erythrocytes differ from the other nucleoids studied in that their sedimentation rate does not vary in the manner characteristic of supercoiled DNA.

Intercalation into DNA in intact plastids in vivo and in plastid lysates in vitro shows that chromosomal DNA in the most mature chloroplasts intercalates HMT less efficiently than DNA in younger chloroplasts. In contrast, there is no change in HMT intercalation during etioplast differentiation in the dark. Our results also show that DNA in higher plant plastid chromosomes is under superhelical tension in vivo. The lower susceptibility to HMT intercalation of DNA in the most mature chloroplasts indicates that late during chloroplast development the superhelical tension or the binding of proteins to the DNA or both change.

1647523|a|We have tested in vitro the occurrence of a B-to-Z transition in a region of alternating purines and pyrimidines as a consequence of transcription-induced negative supercoiling. By using a monoclonal antibody as a specific Z-DNA stabilizing agent, we demonstrate that the formation of left-handed DNA can transiently occur when a topologically unconstrained template is transcribed. The B-to-Z transition, observed in a subpopulation of templates, appears to be induced by negative supercoiling generated in the wake of an elongating T7 RNA polymerase. Consistent with this, the presence of topoisomerases during the transcription period prevents the change in DNA conformation. These data agree with the 'twin-supercoiled-domain' model for transcription of Liu and Wang (1). Interestingly, our results suggest that the diffusion rate of transcription-induced superhelical twists must be relatively slow compared to their generation, and that under in vitro conditions localized transient supercoiling can reach unexpectedly high levels.

1069279|a|Analysis of the DNA of isolated nucleosomes suggests that virtually all genomic DNA sequences are organized in this basic chromatin subunit. In this report, we demonstrate that although histones reside on the transcriptionally active ovalbumin genes in the oviduct, the organization of proteins about this gene renders it highly sensitive to deoxyribonuclease I (deoxyribonucleate 5'-oligonucleotidohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.5). Treatment of oviduct nuclei from the laying hen with pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I results in the preferential digestion of over 70% of the ovalbumin sequences when only 10% of the total nuclear DNA has been solubilized. Treatment of liver nuclei does not reveal selective sensitivity of these genes to DNase I. Furthermore, regions of DNA not actively transcribed, such as the endogenous leukosis virus genes in the oviduct, are not selectively degraded by this enzyme. Similar digestions with micrococcal nuclease, however, reveal no specific digestion of transcriptionally active chromatin. These data confirm the observations of H. Weintraub and M. Groudine [(1976) Science 193, 848-856] and suggest we are dealing with an aspect of structure that may be necessary to permit transcription of the chromatin complex.

Topoisomerase I-DNA adducts are generated by irradiation of intact cells with UV light and then purified by immunoprecipitation with antibody to topoisomerase I. Analyses of the DNA sequences crosslinked to topoisomerase I by blot-hybridization with appropriate DNA probes indicate that topoisomerase I is concentrated on transcribed regions and not on nontranscribed flanking sequences. Like RNA polymerase II, topoisomerase I is recruited to heat-shock genes during the heat-shock response. However, topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase II can interact independently with the transcribed region because different ratios of topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase II are crosslinked to the highly transcribed hsp70 gene and the moderately transcribed copia genes. We hypothesize that topoisomerase I allows topological changes in DNA that are required for transcription.

In vitro, temperature changes alter helical pitch and, thus, supercoiling. We find that plasmids isolated from bacteria grown at different temperatures exhibit differences in DNA linking numbers. The differences in plasmid linking numbers offset the effect temperature is expected to have on supercoiling. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that fine control of DNA topology in bacterial cells is brought about by changes in linking number to maintain a constant value for supercoiling.

With increasing transcription of the genes, the coding region was demonstrated to be depleted first of H1 and then of all histones.

No histones were found in the 5'-terminal DNAase I-hypersensitive region, which may be a prerequisite to gene activation.

1848159|a|Eukaryotic chromosomes are thought to be organized into a series of discrete higher order chromatin domains. This organization is believed to be important not only in the compaction of the chromatin fiber, but also in the utilization of genetic information. Each domain would define an independent unit of gene activity, insulated from the regulatory influences of adjacent domains. Critical to this model of chromosome organization and function are the domain boundaries: the special nucleoprotein structures that delimit each higher order domain and segregate the chromosome into units of independent gene activity. In the work reported here we have tested whether two putative domain boundaries, scs and scs', from the Drosophila 87A7 heat shock locus can establish a domain of independent gene activity in vivo and insulate against chromosomal position effects.

1569958|a|Chromosomes of higher eukaryotes are thought to be organized into a series of discrete and topologically independent higher-order domains. In addition to providing a mechanism for chromatin compaction, these higher-order domains are thought to define independent units of gene activity. Implicit in most models for the folding of the chromatin fiber are special nucleoprotein structures, the domain boundaries, which serve to delimit each higher-order chromosomal domain. We have used an "enhancer-blocking assay" to test putative domain boundaries for boundary function in vivo. This assay is based on the notion that in delimiting independent units of gene activity, domain boundaries should be able to restrict the scope of activity of enhancer elements to genes which reside within the same domain. In this case, interposing a boundary between an enhancer and a promoter should block the action of the enhancer. In the experiments reported here, we have used the yolk protein-1 enhancer element and an hsp70 promoter:lacZ fusion gene to test putative boundary DNA segments for enhancer-blocking activity. We have found that several scs-like elements are capable of blocking the action of the yp-1 enhancer when placed between it and the hsp70 promoter. In contrast, a MAR/SAR DNA segment and another spacer DNA segment had no apparent effect on enhancer activity.

6272202|a|The precise number of base pairs per turn of the DNA double helix in the nucleosome core particle has been the subject of controversy. In this paper the positions of nuclease cutting sites are analysed in three dimensions. Using this midpoint of the DNA on the nucleosome dyad as origin, the cutting site locations measured along a strand of DNA are mapped onto models of the nucleosome core containing DNA of different helical periodicities. It is found that a helical periodicity of 10.5 base pairs per turn leads to cutting site positions which are sterically inaccessible. In contrast, a periodicity of 10.0 base pairs per turn leads to cutting site positions which are not only sterically sound, but which fall into a pattern such as would be expected when the access of the nuclease to the DNA is restricted by the presence of the histone core on one side and of the adjacent superhelical turn of DNA on the other. As proposed earlier by us (1), a value for the helical periodicity close to 10 base pairs per turn on the nucleosome, taken together with a periodicity close to 10.5 for DNA in solution - a value now established - resolves the so-called linkage number paradox.

3273186|a|We have described an exonuclease III/photoreversal procedure to map, with base pair resolution, the bases which have photoreacted with 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (Me3-psoralen) forming either monoadducts or interstrand cross-links in DNA (20). This assay allows quantitation of relative rates of Me3-psoralen photobinding to bases in DNA at levels as low as one cross-link per 8,000 base pairs. This assay should be useful for a wide variety of applications of Me3-psoralen photobinding to DNA. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of the Me3-psoralen exo III assay for analysis of the conformation of the Z forming sequences (GT)12ATGT and GAATTC(TG)6TA(TG)6. We have shown previously that Me3-psoralen forms crosslinks in the 5'TA within the (CG)6TA(CG)6 sequence when it exists in the B conformation but not when it exists in the Z conformation (34). More recently we have confirmed this result with the exo III assay and have shown at least a hundred fold increase in Me3-psoralen photoreactivity at the 5'AT sequence within the EcoR I sites (GAATTC) which presumably represent B-Z junctions flanking (CG)6TA(CG)6 (20). Here we demonstrate both the characteristic decrease in psoralen photobinding to 5'TAs within (GT)12ATGT and (TG)6TA(TG)6 and the hyperreactivity of B-Z junctions. These characteristic properties of Me3-psoralen photobinding provide an assay for Z-DNA that is applicable in vivo. The general applicability of this approach for assaying Z-DNA in vivo is discussed.

2555773|a|Topoisomerase I cleavage sites have been mapped in vivo on the Hsp70 heat shock gene of Drosophila melanogaster cells using the drug camptothecin. Topoisomerase I cleavage was only observed when the Hsp70 gene was transcriptionally active. Site-specific single-strand DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I was confined to the transcribed region of the Hsp70 gene and occurred on both the transcribed and nontranscribed DNA strands. A number of the single-strand breaks on the complementary DNA strands occurred in close proximity giving rise to double-stranded DNA breaks. Inhibition of heat-induced Hsp70 transcription by either Actinomycin D (Act D) or 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) inhibited topoisomerase I cleavage except at the 5' and to a lesser extent the 3' end of the gene. Camptothecin (100 microM) inhibited transcription of the Hsp70 gene greater than 95%. These results suggest that topoisomerase I is intimately associated with and has an integral part in Hsp70 gene transcription.

1312349|a|We have compared topoisomerase I and II cleavage sites on the actin 5C and 57A genes and the hsp70 genes in Drosophila Kc cells using the inhibitors camptothecin (topoisomerase I specific) and VM-26 (topoisomerase II specific) to assess the role of these enzymes in transcriptional regulation. Topoisomerase I cleavage sites were localized to the transcribed regions of the actin 5C and hsp70 genes and were present only when these genes were active. The actin 57A gene, shown previously to be inactive in Kc cells, had no detectable topoisomerase I cleavage sites. In contrast to topoisomerase I, topoisomerase II cleavage sites could be detected on transcriptionally active and inactive actin and hsp70 DNA sequences. Topoisomerase II cleavage sites on the inactive hsp70 gene were primarily localized to the very 5' end of the transcribed region of the gene. However, upon heat-induced activation of hsp70 transcription, topoisomerase II cleavage rapidly shifted from the 5' to the 3' end of the gene. Then, during the shutdown of hsp70 expression, there was a gradual reappearance of topoisomerase II cleavage at the 5' end of the gene that temporally correlated with the repression of hsp70 transcription. There was a similar preferential association of topoisomerase II with the 5' ends of transcriptionally repressed actin 5C and 57A genes. These results demonstrate that there are marked differences in how topoisomerases I and II interact with transcriptionally active and inactive regions of chromatin. In addition, we have identified an unusual type of topoisomerase II binding site that is preferentially associated with the 5' ends of inactive hsp70 and actin genes, suggesting that this enzyme may facilitate changes in chromatin structure that are associated with repression of gene transcription.

1060078|a|Partial digestion of rat liver nuclei with staphylococcal nuclease results in the liberation of nucleo-protein complexes consisting of one or more upsilon bodies. By velocity centrifugation we have isolated the monomeric subunit in relatively pure form. We find that this subunit contains 185 base pairs of DNA and 240,000 daltons of protein, resulting in a protein to DNA ratio identical to that of unperturbed chromatin. The isolated monomeric particle is further susceptible to internal nuclease attack resulting in the solubilization of 46% of the monomeric DNA. Analysis of the resistant DNA reveals a complex but highly reproducible pattern of DNA fragments ranging from 160 to 60 base pairs in length. Analysis of the reassociation kinetics of the isolated subunit DNA reveals that most, if not all genomic sequences, are involved in this basic subunit structure. No special frequency class of DNA is absent from upsilon bodies. Furthermore, virtually all liver sequences transcribed into mRNA are present in upsilon body DNA. These results indicate that upsilon body formation may be random with respect to DNA sequence and suggest that the mere presence of upsilon bodies over a specific region of DNA is not sufficient to restrict its transcription.

1944280|a|The existence of torsional stress in eukaryotic chromatin has been controversial. To determine whether it could be detected, we probed the structure of an alternating AT tract. These sequences adopt cruciform geometry when the DNA helix is torsionally strained by negative supercoiling. The single-strand-specific nuclease P1 was used to determine the structure of an alternating AT sequence upstream of the Xenopus beta-globin gene when assembled into chromatin in microinjected Xenopus oocytes. The pattern of cleavage by P1 nuclease strongly suggests that the DNA in this chromatin template is under torsional stress. The cruciform was detected specifically in the most fully reconstituted templates at later stages of chromatin assembly, suggesting that negative supercoiling is associated with chromatin maturation. Furthermore, the number of torsionally strained templates increased dramatically at the time when transcription of assembled chromatin templates began. Transcription itself has been shown to induce supercoiling, but the requisite negative supercoiling for cruciform extrusion by (AT)n in oocytes was not generated in this way since the characteristic P1 cutting pattern was retained even when RNA polymerase elongation was blocked with alpha-amanitin. Thus, torsional stress is associated with transcriptional activation of chromatin templates in the absence of ongoing transcription.

2823250|a|Transcription of a right-handed double-helical DNA requires a relative rotation of the RNA polymerase and its nascent RNA around the DNA. We describe conditions under which the resistance to the rotational motion of the transcription ensemble around the DNA can be large. In such cases, the advancing polymerase generates positive supercoils in the DNA template ahead of it and negative supercoils behind it. Mutual annihilation of the positively and negatively supercoiled regions may be prevented by anchoring points on the DNA to a large structure, or, in the case of an unanchored plasmid, by the presence of two oppositely oriented transcription units. In prokaryotes, DNA topoisomerase I preferentially removes negative supercoils and DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) removes positive ones. Our model thus provides an explanation for the experimentally observed high degree of negative or positive supercoiling of intracellular pBR322 DNA when DNA topoisomerase I or gyrase is respectively inhibited. We discuss the implications of our model in terms of supercoiling regulation, DNA conformational transitions, and gene regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

1631091|a|Torsional tension in DNA may be both a prerequisite for the efficient initiation of transcription and a consequence of the transcription process itself with the generation of positive torsional tension in front of the RNA polymerase and negative torsional tension behind it. To examine torsional tension in specific regions of genomic DNA in vivo, we developed an assay using photoactivated psoralen as a probe for unconstrained DNA superhelicity and x-rays as a means to relax DNA. Psoralen intercalates more readily into DNA underwound by negative torsional tension than into relaxed. DNA, and it can form interstrand DNA cross-links upon UVA irradiation. By comparing the amount of psoralen-induced DNA cross-links in cells irradiated with x-rays either before or after the psoralen treatment, we examined the topological state of the DNA in specific regions of the genome in cultured human 6A3 cells. We found that although no net torsional tension was detected in the bulk of the genome, localized tension was prominent in the DNA of two active genes. Negative torsional tension was found in the 5' end of the amplified dihydrofolate reductase gene and in a region near the 5' end of the 45S rRNA transcription unit, whereas a low level of positive torsional tension was found in a region near the 3' end of the dihydrofolate reductase gene. These results document an intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA torsional tension and lend support to the twin supercoiled domain model for transcription in the genome of intact human cells.

1323299|a|The role of histones and higher order chromatin structures in protecting against oxidative DNA damage was investigated using an in vitro system consisting of nuclear and nucleoid monolayers as model chromatin substrates. These substrates, derived from human skin fibroblasts, were challenged with hydroxyl radicals produced via a Fenton reaction involving Fe(II)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and ascorbic acid. The resulting DNA strand breaks were measured using the alkaline unwinding technique. The sequential removal of chromosomal proteins from the DNA by pretreating nuclear monolayers with increasing concentrations of salt dramatically increased the frequency of hydroxyl radical-induced DNA strand breaks. Furthermore, the DNA in decondensed chromatin was found to contain 14-fold fewer DNA strand breaks than naked, supercoiled DNA, whereas the DNA of "native" chromatin and "condensed" chromatin contained 100-fold and 300-fold fewer breaks, respectively. We conclude that the binding of histones to the DNA and its organization into higher order chromatin structures dramatically protects the DNA against hydroxyl radical-induced DNA strand breaks and thus should be considered part of the cellular defense against the induction of oxidative DNA damage.

6262809|a|The sequence of 470 nucleotides surrounding the initiation site for rRNA transcription in Drosophila melanogaster has been determined. The precise initiation site was determined first by measuring the DNA fragment protected by the rRNA precursor against digestion by the single-strand specific nuclease S1 and second by direct sequence determination of the first 13 nucleotides of the rRNA precursor. Because greater than 80% od rRNA precursor molecules have been shown previously to bear pppA or ppA 5' termini, we assume that they represent the primary transcription product. Short sequence homologies exist with the initiation regions for rRNA transcription of Xenopus laevis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the initiation region in four cloned ribosomal genes from D. melanogaster which are not interrupted and in four cloned ribosomal genes in which the 28S rRNA coding region is interrupted by a 5-kilobase type 1 insertion. Three uninterrupted genes and three interrupted genes have identical sequences in the entire analyzed region. The remaining two genes have a single identical base substitution at position -17. We have shown previously that interrupted ribosomal genes in D. melanogaster are not effectively transcribed. Because the nucleotide sequences of the region where transcription initiates are identical in genes with or without insertions, we postulate that the presence of the insertion itself may be responsible for the inactivity of the interrupted genes.

RNA and DNA are denatured in 1 M glyoxal (ethanedial) and 50% (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide, at 50 degrees. The glyoxalated nucleic acids are then subjected to electrophoresis through either acrylamide or agarose gels in a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. When glyoxalated DNA molecules of known molecular weights are used as standards, accurate molecular weights for RNA are obtained. Furthermore, we have employed the metachromatic stain acridine orange for visualization of nucleic acids in gels.

By using these techniques, native and denatured DNA and RNA molecules can be analyzed on the same slab gel.

Transcription factors IIB, IID, and IIE and RNA polymerase II are required for accurate initiation of transcription. Linear and relaxed closed circular DNA show a similar level of template activity. However, transcription of closed circular DNA is stimulated when negative supercoils are introduced by the addition of DNA topoisomerase II and supercoiling factor purified from the posterior silk gland of Bombyx mori. Dissection of transcription into pre- and postinitiation steps by the use of Sarkosyl reveals that DNA supercoiling promotes formation of a preinitiation complex. Furthermore, order of addition experiments suggest that DNA supercoiling facilitates a functional binding of transcription factor IID to the promoter.

2502314|a|Patterns of histone binding to DNA of transcriptionally active D. melanogaster hsp70 genes within the nuclei have been analyzed by two methods of histone-DNA chemical cross-linking. When cross-linking is restricted to the central, "globular" regions of histones, it drops most for H1, to an intermediate extent for H2A and H2B, and least for H3 and H4 in transcriptionally active versus transcriptionally silent chromatin. When it occurs via histone terminal regions as well, cross-linking is quantitatively similar for active and inactive chromatin. Neither cross-linking method detects histones on the hsp70 promoter region. It appears that chromatin activation decreases histone binding to DNA via the "globular" regions, known to be essential for the folding of nucleosomes and the 30 nm chromatin fibril, but does not significantly affect the interaction of flexible and loosely bound histone "tails" with DNA. The role of these histone-DNA interaction changes in the unfolding of active chromatin and RNA polymerase reading through histone-bound DNA is discussed.

The effect of acetylation on the linking number per nucleosome particle has been determined. With increasing levels of acetylation, the negative linking number change per nucleosome decreases from -1.04 +/- 0.08 for control to -0.82 +/- 0.05 for highly acetylated nucleosomes. These results indicate that histone acetylation has the ability to release negative supercoils previously constrained by nucleosomes into a closed chromatin loop and in effect function as a eukaryotic gyrase.

2123193|a|High levels of acetylation of lysines in the amino-terminal domains of all four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, have been shown to reduce the linking number change per nucleosome core particle in reconstituted minichromosomes (Norton, V. G., Imai, B. S., Yau, P., and Bradbury, E. M. (1989) Cell 57, 449-457). Because there is evidence to suggest that the acetylations of H3 and H4 have functions that are distinct from those of H2A and H2B, we have determined the nucleosome core particle linking number change in minichromosomes containing fully acetylated H3 and H4 and very low levels of acetylation in H2A and H2B. This linking number change was -0.81 +/- 0.05, in close agreement with the linking number change for hyperacetylated nucleosome core particles which contain high levels of acetylation in all four core histones (approximately 70% of full acetylation in H3 and H4). Therefore, high levels of acetylation of H3 and H4 alone are responsible for the reduction in the linking number change per nucleosome core particle.

1922045|a|An RNA polymerase II molecule is associated with the 5' end of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp70 gene under non-heat shock conditions. This polymerase is engaged in transcription but has paused, or arrested, after synthesizing about 25 nucleotides (A. E. Rougvie and J. T. Lis, Cell 54:795-804, 1988). Resumption of elongation by this paused polymerase appears to be the rate-limiting step in hsp70 transcription in uninduced cells. Here we report results of nuclear run-on assays that measure the distribution of elongating and paused RNA polymerase molecules on the hsp70 gene in induced cells. Pausing of polymerase was detected at the 5' end of hsp70 in cells exposed to the intermediate heat shock temperatures of 27 and 30 degrees C. At 30 degrees C, each copy of hsp70 was transcribed approximately five times during the 25-min heat shock that we used. Therefore, once the hsp70 gene is induced to an intermediate level, initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II remains more rapid than the resumption of elongation by a paused polymerase molecule.

4059056|a|The unique properties of nylon membranes allow for dramatic improvement in the capillary transfer of DNA restriction fragments from agarose gels (Southern blotting). By using 0.4 M NaOH as the transfer solvent following a short pre-treatment of the gel in acid, DNA is depurinated during transfer. Fragments of all sizes are eluted and retained quantitatively by the membrane; furthermore, the alkaline solvent induces covalent fixation of DNA to the membrane. The saving in time and materials afforded by this simple modification is accompanied by a marked improvement in resolution and a ten-fold increase in sensitivity of subsequent hybridization analyses. In addition, we have found that nylon membrane completely retains native (and denatured) DNA in transfer solvents of low ionic strength (including distilled water), although quantitative elution of DNA from the gel is limited to fragments smaller than 4 Kb. This property can be utilized in the direct electrophoretic transfer of native restriction fragments from polyacrylamide gels. Exposure of DNA to ultraviolet light, either in the gel or following transfer to nylon membrane, reduces its ability to hybridize.

2318888|a|The relationship between histone acetylation and the capacity of H1 histones to cause the 0.15 M NaCl-induced aggregation/precipitation of transcriptionally active/competent gene chromatin fragments was investigated. Previous studies have shown that transcriptionally active/competent, but not repressed, gene chromatin polynucleosomes, which were isolated from chicken erythrocytes, remained soluble in 0.15 M NaCl after being reconstituted with H1 histones. This result suggested that some component of the active/competent gene nucleosome altered the capacity of the H1 histones to condense the chromatin fiber. Recently, Hebbes et al. (Hebbes, T.R., Thorne, A.W., and Crane-Robinson, C. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 1395-1402) demonstrated directly that active, but not repressed, gene chromatin of chicken erythroid cells contain high levels of acetylated histones. Here, we show that the solubility of active/competent gene chromatin fragments in 0.15 M NaCl is dependent on the level of acetylated histone species, with induction of hyperacetylation increasing the solubility of this gene chromatin. Also, we show that lowering the levels of the acetylated histone forms reduces the ability of the active/competent gene chromatin fragments to resist exogenously added H1-histone-induced 0.15 M NaCl aggregation/precipitation. These results suggest that histone acetylation alters the capacity of the H1 histones to form compact higher order chromatin structures such that active/competent gene chromatin is maintained in a less folded state than the bulk of chromatin.

Here, we show that this promoter-associated RNA polymerase II molecule is transcriptionally engaged and has formed a nascent RNA chain of approximately 25 nucleotides in length, but is apparently arrested at that point and unable to penetrate further into the hsp70 gene without heat induction. The detection of a post-initiation RNA polymerase complex on the promoter region of the inactive gene suggests that there is a transcriptional control mechanism that acts at a step early in transcript elongation.

VM26 induces topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breakage in vitro and in cultured D. melanogaster cells presumably by stabilizing an enzyme-DNA cleavable complex. The drug-induced DNA breaks on D. melanogaster hsp70 genes were mapped in cultured cells using the indirect end-labeling procedure. Multiple and specific cleavage sites occurred at both the 3' and 5' ends of the hsp70 genes. A number of these cellular topoisomerase II cleavage sites mapped close to the DNase I-hypersensitive regions of the hsp70 genes. The intensities of several topoisomerase II cleavage sites changed significantly on heat shock induction. Treatment of cultured D. melanogaster cells with VM26 at 25 degrees C resulted in the stimulation of transcription of the hsp70 genes. These results suggest that inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II may lead to heat shock transcription.

1321070|a|Previous work has shown that rRNA synthesis is strongly inhibited in yeast top1-top2 double mutants. Here, we show that inactivation of yeast topoisomerases can have paradoxical effects on transcription by RNA polymerase I. For example, transcription of ribosomal minigenes on extrachromosomal plasmids is greatly stimulated in top1-top2 cells while accumulation of full-length endogenous rRNA is strongly inhibited. We present evidence for a mechanism that can partly account for these opposing effects on transcription. On the one hand, transcription initiation can be stimulated owing to an accumulation of negative superhelicity because polymerase I prefers to initiate on negatively supercoiled templates. Conversely, synthesis of full-length rRNA is inhibited owing to the fact that chain elongation requires a DNA relaxing activity.

The most critical of these for transcriptional activation appears to be the one closest to the TATA-homology region. This domain, spanning sequences from -40 to -95, consists of two contiguous HSTF binding sites (sites 1 and 2) that are occupied in a cooperative manner (see Fig. 1). Recent alkylation interference and protection studies suggest a conformational change occurs in the protein-DNA complex at site 1 upon sequential HSTF binding at site 2 (ref. 5). We report here that HSTF binding to a single site or to both contiguous sites results in the introduction of a specific DNA bend within this domain of the hsp 70 promoter.

6254668|a|The rate of covalent photobinding of trimethylpsoralen to DNA is greater when the DNA is wound with negative superhelical tension than when it is relaxed. In vitro the rate of photobinding is directly proportional to the negative superhelical density of the DNA. Thus measurement of the rate of photobinding provides an assay for probing in vivo unrestrained tension in the winding of the DNA double helix. This approach has been applied to measure torsional tension in DNA as it is packaged in living E. coli. Drosophila and HeLa cells. A method is described for measuring the rate of photobinding to intracellular DNA and rRNA, and for using the latter measurement as an internal control of the rate of me3-psoralen photobinding in vivo. This permits more accurate and reproducible measurement of changes in the DNA-psoralen photobinding reaction. The me3-psoralen probe interacts with intracellular bacterial DNA as expected for a purified DNA duplex wound with superhelical density sigma = -0.05 +/- 0.01. This superhelical tension is relaxed in cells when multiple single-strand breaks are introduced into the chromosomal DNA by gamma-irradiation. Similar relaxation occurs when cells are treated with the DNA gyrase inhibitor coumermycin. The results suggest that the DNA double helix is wound with torsional tension in vivo and that DNA supercoils which are equilibrated with this tension are not completely restrained in nucleosome-like structures. Torsional tension in the DNA of eucaryotic cells is not detectable in analogous measurements of the packaged DNA of HeLa and Drosophila cells. The simplest interpretation of this finding is that, within the limits of detection, all superhelical turns in the DNA are restrained in nucleosomes or nucleosome-like structures in these eucaryotic cells.

6289885|a|The structure of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA in the nuclei of living infected cells was studied with the DNA photoaffinity probe 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen. The rate of photobinding to HSV-1 DNA was compared to that of a suitable internal control at different times during infection. The rates of photobinding to DNA packaged in virions, capsids, and prereplicative and postreplicative DNA were characteristically different. By 4 h after infection, after the initiation of DNA replication, the rate of photobinding to HSV-1 DNA increased 4 times relative to the rate of binding to the host DNA. The enhanced rate of photobinding to HSV-1 DNA was maintained at all later times during infection and was not affected when frequent single-strand breaks were introduced in HSV-1 DNA by gamma irradiation of infected cells. The results suggest that the bulk of the replicating herpes DNA is free of torsional tension and that the differing rates of photobinding are attributable to changes in accessibility of the HSV-1 DNA. The results are compatible with previous proposals, based on in vitro studies, that intranuclear HSV-1 DNA is primarily free of nucleosomal organization and suggest that there are few, if any, unrestrained DNA supercoils averaged over the entire HSV-1 genome.

6092647|a|Trimethylpsoralen was used to crosslink the extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA in nucleoli or nuclei of growing Dictyostelium discoideum cells. The DNA was extracted and was examined by spreading under denaturing conditions for electron microscopy. Intact 95,000 base ribosomal DNA molecules were seen, showing regularly spaced, single-stranded bubbles of about 200 to 400 bases in size, interrupted twice by 11,000 base heavily crosslinked stretches, which correspond to the known positions of the coding regions. The bubbles on the nontranscribed regions indicate the presence of nucleosomes during crosslinking. The DNA was digested with restriction enzymes and analysed by gel electrophoresis in parallel with DNA not treated with psoralen. Fragments from the non-coding region had the same mobility as untreated DNA, while those from the coding region had a markedly lower mobility, though not as low as that of crosslinked pure DNA. This shifting of the bands, specific to the coding region, was also seen when whole cells were treated with psoralen. Treatment of nucleoli with 2 m-NaCl (which is known to dissociate histones) before addition of psoralen led to strong crosslinking all along the ribosomal DNA, resulting in a decreased electrophoretic mobility of bands from the non-coding region, but no further retardation of those from the coding region. In differentiating Dictyostelium cells, slugs, where ribosomal RNA synthesis is very much reduced, the extent of psoralen-crosslinking in the coding region was reduced, but not completely to the level of that of the non-transcribed spacer. In order to test whether psoralen itself alters chromatin structure, crosslinked and non-crosslinked nucleoli from growing cells were lysed with heparin and spread for electron microscopy. There was no difference in the appearance or the frequency of the transcription units seen. Digestion of crosslinked nuclei with micrococcal nuclease indicated an undisturbed structure for bulk chromatin, as well as for the chromatin in the non-transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA. Thus psoralen-crosslinking does not lead to extensive disruption or distortion of the structure of either inactive or active chromatin. We conclude, taking the results presented in the Appendix into account, that the extent of psoralen-crosslinking in chromatin DNA is diagnostic for the structure of undistorted chromatin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

2454748|a|We have used formaldehyde-mediated protein-DNA crosslinking within intact cells to examine the in vivo chromatin structure of the D. melanogaster heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) genes. In agreement with previous in vitro studies, we find that the heat shock-mediated transcriptional induction of the hsp70 genes perturbs their chromatin structure, resulting in fewer protein-DNA contacts crosslinkable in vivo by formaldehyde. However, contrary to earlier in vitro evidence that histones may be absent from actively transcribed genes, we show directly, by immunoprecipitation of in vivo-crosslinked chromatin fragments, that at least histone H4 remains bound to hsp70 DNA in vivo, irrespective of its rate of transcription. The formaldehyde-based in vivo mapping techniques described in this work are generally applicable, and can be used both to probe protein-DNA interactions within specific genes and to determine the genomic location of specific chromosomal proteins.

2193290|a|Each step in the synthesis of functional transcript by RNA polymerase II provides a level at which gene expression can be regulated. Control over the elongation phase of transcription is a recognized regulatory mechanism in prokaryotes; however, only recently have examples of conditional transcription elongation blockage been reported in eukaryotic cellular genes. In several cases, control over transcription elongation clearly contributes to the regulated expression of these genes. Indeed, reports that transcription by RNA polymerase II is initiated and paused on many Drosophila promoters, prior to induction of gene expression, suggests that release of an arrested polymerase, as opposed to polymerase recruitment to a disengaged promoter, may be the key regulatory step for many genes thought to be controlled by transcription initiation (Rougvie & Lis, 1988). RNA polymerase II undergoes modifications, such as association with ancillary elongation factors and phosphorylation of its large subunit carboxy terminal domain (CTD), at stages subsequent to recruitment to a promoter and establishment of a pre-initiation complex (Reinberg & Roeder, 1987; Rappaport et al., 1987; Payne et al., 1989; Laybourn & Dahmus, 1989). It is possible that modifications such as these, or others occurring prior to, during or following transcription initiation, may alter the holoenzyme's transcription elongation properties, to allow recognition or read-through of elongation block signals within a transcription unit. In this review, we will present features of transcription elongation blockage in several eukaryotic cellular genes in the context of our understanding of attenuation and premature transcription termination in prokaryotic and viral genes. We will also present evidence supporting the model that modifications to the RNA polymerase II transcription complex are pivotal to the control of transcriptional at the level of elongation.

2153054|a|The functional association between DNA topoisomerase I and gene activity has been analyzed using the tightly regulated c-fos proto-oncogene, which undergoes rapid transitions between active and inactive states of transcription. We show that the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin can be used to measure topoisomerase I activity throughout the transcription cycle of the c-fos gene. Upon induction of c-fos transcription in the presence of camptothecin, topoisomerase I cleavages spread through the gene in the 5' to 3' direction and concomitantly transcriptional elongation is retarded. Parallel kinetic measurements of RNA polymerase II activity and topoisomerase I activity demonstrate a quantitative and temporal link between the two enzymes. Our results argue that topoisomerase I quantitatively relieves the torsional consequences of transcriptional elongation in intact cells.

2459121|a|Transcription of the Bombyx mori fibroin gene in a posterior silk gland extract can be separated into three functional steps on the basis of sensitivity to Sarkosyl: 1) formation of an initiation complex, which is blocked by 0.025% Sarkosyl; 2) conversion of the initiation complex to an elongation complex, a step sensitive to 0.05% Sarkosyl; 3) the subsequent elongation of RNA chain which occurs in the presence of 0.05% Sarkosyl. Whereas the last two steps are rapid and unaffected by template topology, the first step is slow and affected by DNA conformation. In the posterior silk gland extract, closed circular DNA forms a superhelical state and supports more rapid assembly of the initiation complex than linear DNA does. Both DNA supercoiling and rapid assembly of the initiation complex require ATP and are abolished by the addition of a topoisomerase II inhibitor VP16. These results suggest that DNA supercoiling enhances the fibroin gene transcription by facilitating formation of the initiation complex.

2317863|a|Actively transcribed chromatin is structurally different from bulk inactive chromatin. It has been difficult to define the molecular basis of the difference, however, because purified fractions of active chromatin were not available. We have overcome this problem by releasing oligonucleosomes from the nonmethylated CpG-rich islands (CpG islands) of HeLa cell nuclei using restriction endonucleases. Since CpG islands very often include the promoters and 5' transcribed regions of genes, they represent a model for the "active" chromatin structure. CpG island chromatin differs in three respects from bulk chromatin prepared in the same way: histone H1 is present in very low amounts; histones H3 and H4 are highly acetylated; and nucleosome-free regions are present. Except for the latter regions, the average nucleosomal spacing is similar to that of bulk chromatin.

Our results show that the structure of chloroplast chromosomes in at least three widely separated regions is different in light-grown vs. dark-grown cells. Structural changes in chloroplast chromosomes occur within 3 hrs after exposure to light or darkness, respectively. The response to light is not inhibited by atrazine and can be elicited by dim blue light incapable of evolving O2, indicating that it does not require photosynthesis. Inhibition of cytoplasmic protein synthesis with cycloheximide prevents this response to light, indicating that it depends, at least in part, on proteins imported from the cytoplasm.

H4 molecules acetylated at lysines 5 or 8 are distributed in overlapping, but nonidentical, islands throughout the euchromatic chromosome arms. beta-Heterochromatin in the chromocenter is depleted in these isoforms, but relatively enriched in H4 acetylated at lysine 12. H4 acetylated at lysine 16 is found at numerous sites along the transcriptionally hyperactive X chromosome in male larvae, but not in male autosomes or any chromosome in female cells. These findings support the hypothesis that H4 molecules acetylated at particular sites mediate unique and specific effects on chromatin function.

1656219|a|In the studies reported here we have used topoisomerase II as a model system for analyzing the factors that determine the sites of action for DNA-binding proteins in vivo. To localize topoisomerase II sites in vivo we used an inhibitor of the purified enzyme, the antitumor drug VM-26. This drug stabilizes an intermediate in the catalytic cycle, the cleavable complex, and substantially stimulates DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II. We show that lysis of VM-26 treated tissue culture cells with sodium dodecyl sulfate induces highly specific double-strand breaks in genomic DNA, and we present evidence indicating that these double-strand breaks are generated by topoisomerase II. Using indirect end labeling to map the cleavage products, we have examined the in vivo sites of action of topoisomerase II in the 87A7 heat shock locus, the histone repeat, and a tRNA gene cluster at 90BC. Our analysis reveals that chromatin structure, not sequence specificity, is the primary determinant in topoisomerase II site selection in vivo. We suggest that chromatin organization may provide a general mechanism for generating specificity in a wide range of DNA-protein interactions in vivo.

2997449|a|The chromatin fiber of eukaryotic chromosomes is thought to be organized into a series of discrete domains or loops. To learn more about these large-scale structures, we have examined the sequence and chromatin organization of the DNA segments surrounding the two hsp 70 genes at the Drosophila melanogaster cytogenetic locus 87A7. These studies indicate that this heat shock locus is flanked on both the proximal and distal sides by novel chromatin structures, which we have called, respectively, scs and scs' (specialized chromatin structures). Each structure is defined by two sets of closely spaced nuclease-hypersensitive sites arranged around a central nuclease-resistant segment. Our findings suggest that these two structures define the proximal and distal boundaries of the 87A7 chromomere and, hence, may be one of the first examples of anchor points for the organization of eukaryotic chromosomes into a series of discrete higher order domains. Moreover, these structures may provide focal points both for the decondensation of the chromomere when the hsp 70 genes are induced by heat shock and for the subsequent rewinding and condensation of the chromomere during recovery from heat shock.

3281259|a|A number of ways are known by which an event at one location on a DNA molecule can affect an event at a distant location on the same molecule. Three classes of mechanisms are described for such distal actions: tracking or translocation of a protein along a DNA, the association of two proteins bound at separate sites to form a DNA loop in between, and distal interactions that are affected by the topology of the DNA. The basic characteristics of each type of mechanism are discussed in terms of the known physicochemical properties of DNA. The various modes of action at a distance are often interrelated. Examples include the formation of positively and negatively supercoiled DNA loops by tracking and the strong effects of DNA topology on looping.

455450|a|We have compared the chromatin structure in the active and inactive states at loci encoding the major heat shock protein in Drosophila. DNAase I and micrococcal nuclease were used as probes of higher order organization and nucleosomal integrity. Such integrity is gauged here by the characteristic pattern of discrete DNA fragments produced at specific chromosomal loci by nucleolytic cleavage. The specific fragment patterns are visualized by gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting onto nitrocellulose sheets, hybridization with 32P-labeled cloned DNA containing the heat shock genes and autoradiography. Using this criterion, a disruption in nucleosomal and possibly in higher order organization are observed as indicated by a relative loss or smearing of the characteristic discrete DNA fragment patterns from the heat shock loci in the active state. The fragment patterns are restored when cells are allowed to recover from heat shock and these loci return to the inactive state.

2835168|a|We show that transcription of a DNA molecule inside a bacterium is accompanied by local and temporal supercoiling of the DNA template: as transcription proceeds, DNA in front of the transcription ensemble becomes positively supercoiled, and DNA behind the ensemble becomes negatively supercoiled. Because bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase I act differently on positively and negatively supercoiled DNA, the formation of twin supercoiled domains during transcription is manifested by a large increase or decrease in the linking number of an intracellular plasmid when bacterial DNA gyrase or topoisomerase I, respectively, is inhibited. Such changes in linking number are strongly dependent on transcription of the plasmid in cis and on the relative orientations of transcription units on the plasmid. These results indicate that the state of supercoiling of bacterial DNA is strongly modulated by transcription, and that DNA topoisomerases are normally involved in the elongation step of transcription.

1920399|a|We describe the development and application of "torsionally tuned" Z-DNA and cruciform probes for analyzing the level of unrestrained supercoiling at specific sites in the DNA of living cells. This approach is applicable for the analysis of dynamic differences in supercoiled DNA in different parts of plasmid, bacterial, or eukaryotic chromosomes. Using a psoralen-based assay, we have shown that the Z-DNA forming sequence (CG)6TA(CG)6, cloned into plasmid pUC8, exists as Z-DNA in 30 to 40% of plasmid molecules in wild-type Escherichia coli. This level suggested an in vivo superhelical density of sigma = -0.034 at the site of insertion in the plasmid. A higher level of Z-DNA found in cells deficient in topoisomerase I (topA10) suggested an in vivo superhelical density of sigma = -0.048. We have constructed a set of torsionally tuned inverted repeated DNA molecules which require different superhelical densities for cruciform formation. Using these inverted repeats and a crosslink assay for cruciforms, we present quantitative evidence for the existence of cruciforms in living E. coli cells. Cruciform formation was dependent on DNA supercoiling in vivo and on the location of the inverted repeat within a plasmid. In topA10 cells cruciforms were detected in less than 0.5% of plasmids when cloned into two different transcriptional units: the lacZ and CAT genes. However, when cloned outside a transcriptional unit, cruciforms were found at levels up to 50% in topA10 cells. More cruciforms were found upstream than downstream from divergent promoters in pBR322. From analysis of the fraction of different inverted repeats existing as cruciforms in vivo and the levels of supercoiling required for cruciform formation in vitro, we estimate in vivo superhelical densities of sigma = -0.034 and -0.041 for the EcoRI site of pUC8-based plasmids in wild-type and topA10 cells, respectively.

237121|a|1. The penetration of organic anions into bovine red blood cells has been studied under experimental conditions where it could be distinguished from the penetration of undissociated acids which proceeds by diffusion through lipid zones of the membrane. 2. Several lines of evidence suggest that the entry of organic anions cannot be ascribed to simple diffusion across aqueous channels limited by positive charges but needs a specific interaction of the penetrating anion with a component of the membrane. 3. The structural requirements allowing for ionic transfer is a strong polar head for the smallest molecules and in addition an amphiphilic structure for acids with chain length greater than C4. Interaction between substrate and receptor requires at least a three point attachment involving three oxygen atoms in the substrate which react with complementary loci on the receptor to form ionic and hydrogen bonds. Such a three point attachment can be made by a sulphonic group or with carboxylic acid by alpha ketosubstitution, alpha hydroxysubstitution, addition of an amidegroup or addition of a second carboxyl group spatially close to the first. 4. As suggested by the behaviour of the formate anion, in such a transport system any carboxylic acid could interact transiently with the receptor and therefore interfere with the transport of an organic anion even though such ionic interaction with the receptor were insufficient to produce transport of the acid itself.

3945245|a|We measured the rate of oxalate flux across the red-cell membrane in the steady state in 114 patients with a history of calcium oxalate kidney stones and in 25 controls. Of the patients, 98 had recurrent, "idiopathic" kidney stones, 8 had primary hyperparathyroidism, 7 had renal or urinary tract malformations, and 1 had primary hyperoxaluria. Oxalate exchange was significantly higher in the 98 patients with idiopathic stone formation than in the controls (-1.10 +/- 0.95 [SD] X 10(-2) min-1 vs. -0.31 +/- 0.12 X 10(-2); P less than 0.001); it was above the upper limits of normal in 78 of these patients. All 8 patients with hyperparathyroidism and the patient with primary hyperoxaluria had values in the normal range; 2 of the patients with renal or urinary tract malformation had values at the upper normal limit. A study of five families indicated that the abnormality is an autosomal monogenic dominant trait with complete penetrance and variable expressivity. Oxalate-tolerance tests were carried out in five pairs of brothers. One brother in each pair had the abnormality in oxalate flux, and had a significantly higher percentage of oxalate excretion at two hours after oxalate loading (18.09 +/- 3.07 [SD] vs. 10.37 +/- 3.08 percent; t = 3.97; P less than 0.005) and four hours (14.87 +/- 2.91 vs. 9.89 +/- 2.93 percent; t = 2.70; P less than 0.05). Treatment with oral hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg per day) or amiloride (5 mg per day) or both restored normal or nearly normal red-cell oxalate exchange in all of 33 patients who initially had increased rates. We conclude that an inherited cellular defect in oxalate transport may be a factor in "primary" calcium oxalate stone formation and that this defect may be corrected with diuretics.

8388726|a|In human erythrocytes, okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of certain protein phosphatases, promotes a marked increase of Ser/Thr-phosphorylation of membrane proteins, including band-3 protein. Moreover, okadaic acid also increases the band-3-mediated oxalate transport across the membranes, thus suggesting that this process is regulated by Ser/Thr-phosphorylation of transporter band-3 protein.

3995030|a|Dansylation of the red blood cell membrane inhibits monovalent anion transport as measured by means of 36C1 and enhances divalent anion transport as measured by means of 35SO4 (Legrum, Fasold and Passow (1980) Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 361, 1573-1590 and Lepke and Passow (1982) J. Physiol. (London) 328, 27-48). In the present work the effect of dansylation on phosphate equilibrium exchange was studied over the pH range where the ratio between monovalent and divalent phosphate anions varies. At high pH, phosphate equilibrium exchange was enhanced; at low pH, exchange was inhibited. The pH maximum of phosphate equilibrium exchange, seen at pH 6.3 in untreated ghosts is now replaced by a plateau. The inverse effects of dansylation on the rates of exchange at high and low pH suggest that both monovalent and divalent phosphate anions are accepted as substrates by the anion transport protein. A tentative attempt to obtain a quantitative estimate of the ratio of monovalent and divalent phosphate transport indicates that in the untreated red cell membrane over the pH range 7.2-8.5 the transport of HPO42- is negligible compared to the transport of H2PO4-.

2819098|a|Treatment of the erythrocyte membrane with dansyl chloride leads to the following effects: (i) SO4(2-) transport is enhanced, Cl- transport is reduced. At maximal acceleration of sulfate exchange, Cl- exchange is only partially inhibited. The two effects are lineary related suggesting that the Cl- and SO4(2-) transporting forms of band 3 are derived from the same pool. (ii) The maximum of the pH dependence of SO4(2-) equilibrium exchange as measured at low sulfate concentrations is replaced by a plateau. It now resembles the pH dependence of Cl- exchange in untreated red cells. The pH dependence of SO4(2-) equilibrium exchange as measured at high sulfate concentrations is virtually unchanged after dansylation. The pH dependence of the partially inhibited Cl- equilibrium exchange across the dansylated membrane as measured at high chloride concentrations remains similar as in the untreated red cells but is somewhat less pronounced. (iii) SO4(2-)/H+ cotransport remains essentially unaltered after modification by dansyl chloride. The effects of dansylation are discussed in terms of a model similar to the titratable carrier model originally proposed by Gunn (Gunn, R.B. (1972) in Oxygen Affinity of Hemoglobin and Red Cell Acid Base Status (Rorth, M. and Astrup, P., eds.), pp. 823-827, Munksgaard, Copenhagen).

19556|a|Chloride self-exchange in human red cells was studied between 0 degrees C and 38 degrees C. At higher temperatures the flow-tube method was used. Although the general features of chloride transport at 0 degrees C and 38 degrees C are similar, the following differences were found: (a) the maximum pH of chloride self-exchange flux was lowered 0.6 pH unit from 7.8 to 7.2 when temperature was increased from 0 degrees C to 38 degrees C; (b)the apparent half-saturation constant increased from 28 mM at 0 degrees C to 65 mM at 38 degrees C; (c) chloride transport at body temperature is slower than predicted by other investigators by extrapolation from low-temperature results. Chloride transport increased only 200 times when temperature was raised from 0 degrees C to 38 degrees C, because the apparent activation energy decreased from 30 kcal mol(-1) to 20 kcal mol(-1) above a temperature of 15 degrees C; (d) a study of temperature dependence of the slower bromide self-exchange showed that a similar change of activation energy occurred around 25 degrees C. Both in the case of Cl(-) (15 degrees C) and in the case of Br(-) (25 degrees C), critical temperature was reached when the anion self-exchange had a turnover number of about 4x10(9) ions cell (-1)s(-1); (e) inhibition of chloride transport by DIDS (4,4'- diisothiocyano-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonate)revealed that the deflection persisted at 15 degrees C at partial inhibition (66 percent) presumably because DIDS inactivated 66 percent of the transport sites. It is suggested that a less temperature- dependent step of anion exchange becomes rate limiting at the temperature where a critical turnover number is reached.

6487627|a|Anion transport across the red cell membrane has been measured as sulfate self-exchange flux (Ja) in fresh and metabolically depleted human red cells. Depletion of metabolic stores by a starvation of the cells decreases Ja by 50%. A similar effect was observed when ATP was acutely and selectively depleted by iodoacetamide. This inhibition was independent of the presence of calcium and reversible after metabolic rejuvenation of the cells. Ghosts prepared from fresh red cells exhibited the same value of Ja as fresh red cells. By contrast, ghosts prepared from depleted red cells exhibited a decrease in Ja which was reverted by a physiological concentration of ATP. The effect of ATP was dependent on its concentration (Km approximately 40 microM) and on the duration of the metabolic depletion: complete restoration of Ja was obtained only in ghosts prepared from red cells acutely depleted of ATP by a 2 h incubation with iodoacetamide. After a 20 h starvation, Ja restoration was never more than 80%. We postulate that ATP acts primarily through the phosphorylation of band 3 protein, the anion exchanger; it acts also through the stabilization of the normal organization of the membrane. This latter effect may involve the phosphorylation of membrane components, but also a direct interaction, as shown by the influence of other organic phosphates (2,3-diphosphoglycerate and inositol hexaphosphate) on Ja in the absence of ATP.

1415547|a|A Cl(-)-HCO3- exchanger in the brush-border membrane mediates active Cl- absorption and regulates intracellular pH in rabbit ileum. The molecular identity of the ileal Cl(-)-HCO3- exchanger has not been established. The best-characterized plasma membrane Cl(-)-HCO3- exchanger is erythroid band 3. Structurally related proteins in nonerythroid tissues comprise an anion exchanger (AE) family. We used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify and clone a cDNA encoding an ileal band 3-related protein (B3RP) from rabbit ileal enterocytes. The composite sequence is 3,909 bp and is predicted to encode a protein of 136 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence is 95% identical to murine renal AE2, indicating that ileal B3RP is rabbit AE2. Antisera generated against a cytoplasmic fragment of ileal B3RP recognized a 160- to 170-kDa polypeptide in the brush-border membrane, but not the basolateral membrane, of ileal crypt and villus enterocytes. This correlates with previous studies indicating that a Cl(-)-HCO3- exchange is present in brush-border but not basolateral membrane vesicles from rabbit ileal enterocytes. We conclude that ileal B3RP is a product of the AE gene family, and is present in the brush-border of ileal enterocytes, where it may mediate Cl(-)-HCO3- exchange.

933067|a|1. Organic anion permeability in ox red blood cell was measured by studying steady-state self-exchange of oxalate, chosen as a prototypical substrate of the organic anion transport system previously described; chloride self-exchange measured the inorganic anion permeability. 2. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors of the sulphonamide class inhibit both organic anion self-exchange (A-/A-) and chloride self-exchang (CL-/CL-) although carbonic anhydrase plays no role in these exchanges. These results confirm the conclusions already published that sulphonamides can act directly on the cellular membrane as specific inhibitors of anion transport. 3. There is a correlation between the chemical structure of the sulphonamides and their capacity for inhibiting transmembrane anionic exchange. It is of significance that N-sulphamyl substitution, which abolishes the carbonic anhydrase inhibitory potency, does not destroy anionic inhibitory capacity and may even increase it. 4. For each sulphonamide the capacities for inhibiting chloride transport and oxalate transport are strictly identical. Inhibition appears non-competitive. 5. The temperature sensitivity of oxalate self-exchange is exactly the same as that of chloride self-exchange. From this, and from the nature of their inhibition by sulphonamides, it is proposed that chloride and organic anions share the same transport mechanism. 6. In the light of the present results the chloruretic action of sulphonamides in various tissues, in particular the kidney, is discussed.

376851|a|In human erythrocyte, permeability to the anion is instantaneously, reversibly, and noncompetitively inhibited by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, niflumic acid. The active form of this powerful inhibitor (I50 = 6 X 10(-7) M) is the ionic form. We demonstrated that: (i) The binding of niflumic acid to the membrane of unsealed ghosts show one saturable and one linear component over the concentration range studied. The saturable component vanishes when chloride transport is fully inhibited by covalently bound 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyano stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS). Our estimate of these SITS protectable niflumate binding sites (about 9 x 10(5) per cell) agrees with the number of protein molecules per cell in band 3. These sites are half-saturated with 10(-6) M niflumic acid, a concentration very close to I50. (ii) Niflumic acid inhibits the binding reaction of SITS with anion controlling transport sites. These results indicate that niflumic acid and SITS are mutually exclusive inhibitors, suggesting that niflumic acid interacts with the protein in band 3. Niflumic acid also decreases glucose and ouabain-insensitive sodium permeabilities. However, these effects are produced at a very high concentration of niflumic acid (in millimolar range), suggesting unspecific action, possibly through lipid phase.

2397221|a|The temperature dependence of the erythrocyte anion transport protein (Band 3 or AE1) mediated influx of three nonspherical substrates, the divalent anions phosphate and phosphite, and the monovalent hypophoshite, were determined. Phase transitions were found in the temperature dependence of the influxes of all three anions. The 95% confidence limits for the transition temperatures were: 34.6-38.1 degrees C, 7.4-9.1 degrees C and 6.7-9.7 degrees C for phosphate, phosphite and hypophosphite, respectively, while the critical influx rates at the transitions were 29-50, 64-102 and 26-58 ions/s per carrier, respectively. That the critical rates rather than the transition temperatures are of similar magnitude indicates that the transitions are related to transport mechanisms rather than to thermal protein conformational changes. These critical rates are two orders of magnitude lower than those reported for the self-exchange of Cl- and Br- (Brahm, J. (1977) J. Gen. Physiol. 70, 283-306). The critical rate of monovalent hypophosphite is similar to that of divalent phosphate and phosphite, but not to that of Cl- indicating that this effect is mediated by the structure of the substrate rather than by its charge. The disparity in the rates rc at which phase transitions occur in AE1-mediated transport of spherical and nonspherical anions indicates a difference in the interaction between the two classes of anions and the protein.

3062118|a|The movements of Ca2+ within cells in response to external stimuli are complex. Internal Ca2+ release activated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) is now widely established. However, the mechanism of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, the identity and control of the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool and its relationship to other internal and external Ca2+ pools all remain uncertain. We have characterized a highly sensitive and specific guanine nucleotide-regulatory mechanism that induces rapid and profound movements of intracellular Ca2+ via a mechanism distinct from that activated by InsP3. Using permeabilized neural or smooth muscle cells, application of submicromolar concentrations of GTP induces rapid release of Ca2+ from a compartment that contains within it the InsP3-releasable Ca2+ pool. Although of similar GTP-sensitivity as G-protein-activated events, the apparent dependence on GTP hydrolysis and blockade by GTP gamma S suggest a mechanism distinct from those mediated by known G-proteins. Recent experiments in the presence of oxalate reveal rapid and profound GTP-activated uptake of Ca2+ via a mechanism with identical nucleotide sensitivity and specificity to GTP-induced Ca2+ release. These results were interpreted to suggest that GTP induces a transmembrane conveyance of Ca2+ between different compartments distinguished by oxalate permeability; GTP-induced release probably occurs via a similar mechanism except involving transfer between closed compartments and nonclosed membranes (perhaps the plasma membrane). Recently, it has been revealed that GTP activates a translocation of Ca2+ into the Ca2+ pool from which InsP3 induces release. This is an important observation suggesting that the GTP-activated Ca2+ translocation process may control entry into and hence the size of the InsP3-releasable Ca2+ pool. Indeed, it is possible that GTP-induced Ca2+ release observed in permeabilized cells reflects a reversal of the pathway that functions in intact cells to permit external Ca2+ entry into the InsP3-releasable pool. This type of process could mediate the longer-term secretory or excitatory responses to external receptors which are known to be dependent on external Ca2+.

3207750|a|Arrhenius plots of chloride and bromide transport yield two regions with different activation energies (Ea). Below 15 or 25 degrees C (for Cl- and Br-, respectively), Ea is about 32.5 kcal/mol; above these temperatures, about 22.5 kcal/mol (Brahm, J. (1977) J. Gen. Physiol. 70, 283-306). For the temperature dependence of SO4(2-) transport up to 37 degrees C, no such break could be observed. We were able to show that the temperature coefficient for the rate of SO4(2-) transport is higher than that for the rate of denaturation of the band 3 protein (as measured by NMR) or the destruction of the permeability barrier in the red cell membrane. It was possible, therefore, to extend the range of flux measurements up to 60 degrees C and to show that, even for the slowly permeating SO4(2-) in the Arrhenius plot, there appears a break, which is located somewhere between 30 and 37 degrees C and where Ea changes from 32.5 to 24.1 kcal/mol. At the break, the turnover number is approx. 6.9 ions/band 3 per s. Using 35Cl- -NMR (Falke, Pace and Chan (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6472-6480), we also determined the temperature dependence of Cl- -binding. We found no significant change over the entire range from 0 to 57 degrees C, regardless of whether the measurements were performed in the absence or presence of competing SO4(2-). We conclude that the enthalpy changes associated with Cl- - or SO4(2-)-binding are negligible as compared to the Ea values observed. It was possible, therefore, to calculate the thermodynamic parameters defined by transition-state theory for the transition of the anion-loaded transport protein to the activated state for Cl-, Br- and SO4(2-) below and above the temperatures at which the breaks in the Arrhenius plots are seen. We found in both regions a high positive activation entropy, resulting in a low free enthalpy of activation. Thus the internal energy required for carrying the complex between anion and transport protein over the rate-limiting energy barrier is largely compensated for by an increase of randomness in the protein and/or its aqueous environment.

479826|a|The kinetics of chloride and bromide transport were examined in intact human red blood cells and resealed ghosts. Because the influx and efflux of halide ions are almost equal (less than 0.01% difference), the stimulation of the exchange flux by external halides could be determined by measuring 36Cl or 82Br efflux. When the external halide concentration was increased by replacement of isoionic, isotonic solutions of sucrose and the nontransported anion citrate, the stimulation of the exchange flux was hyperbolic and was maximum at 20 mM halide externally. The K 1/2-out, the external concentration of chloride or bromide which stimulated the efflux to half of its maximum value, was 3 and 1 mM respectively, 15-fold smaller than K 1/2-in which we found to be about equal to the K 1/2 of halide self-exchange with nearly equal internal and external concentrations. Thus, the transport mechanism behaves asymmetrically with respect to these transported halides. Bromide flux was two-fold greater in bromide-chloride heteroexchange than in bromide-bromide self-exchange but it was still much smaller than the chloride self-exchange flux. The maximum influx and efflux of bromide in exchange for chloride were roughly eqal. Thus, since the maximum transport rates in the two directions are nearly equal, the kinetics of bromide equilibrium exchange with equal concentrations on the two sides are controlled on the inside where K 1/2 is greatest. The K 1/2-out Cl was a hyperbolic function of internal chloride concentration and was proportional to the maximum flux at each internal chloride concentration. These results are evaluated in terms of two broad categories of models. We conclude that, in contrast to other ion transport systems which have been shown to have kinetics of a sequential mechanism, anion exchange is compatible with a ping-pong mechanism in which a single site reciprocates between inside- and outside-facing orientations with asymmetric K 1/2 values.

4688320|a|The efflux of chloride-36 from human erythrocytes under steady-state conditions is a saturable process that is competitively inhibited by bicarbonate and noncompetitively inhibited by acetate. This chloride self-exchange flux is reversibly dependent on the pH of the medium between 5.7 and 9.6 with a maximum flux at pH 7.8. The increase in chloride flux between pH 5.7 and 7.8 is inexplicable by the fixed charge hypothesis. The interpretations are made that chloride transport in human erythrocytes is carrier mediated, that bicarbonate utilizes the same transport mechanism, and that the mechanism can be titrated with hydrogen ions into less functional forms for chloride transport.

459|a|In order to test the range of pH values over which the titratable carried model for inorganic anion exchange is valid, chloride self-exchange across human red blood cells was examined between pH 4.75 and 5.7 at 0 decrees c. It was found that chloride self-exchange flux had a minimum near pH 5 and increased again with further increase in hydrogen ion activity. The Arrhenius activation energy for chloride exchange was greatly reduced at low pH values. The chloride flux at pH 5.1 did not show the saturation kinetics reported at higher pH values but was proportional to the value of the chloride concentration squared. In addition, the extent of inhibition of chloride self-exchange flux by phloretin was reduced at low pH. Our interpretation of these findings is that the carrier-mediated flux becomes a progressively smaller fraction of the total flux at lower pH values and that a different transport mode requiring two chloride ions to form the permeant species and having a low specificity and temperature dependence becomes significant below pH5. A possible mechanism for this transport is that chloride crosses red cell membranes as dimers of HCl at these very low pH values.

942406|a|The kinetics and activation energy of entry of pyruvate and lactate into the erythrocyte were studied at concentrations below 4 and 15mM respectively. The Km and Vmax. values for both substrates are reported, and it is shown that pyruvate inhibits competitively with respect to lactate and vice versa. In both cases the Km for the carboxylate as a substrate was the same as its Ki as an inhibitor. Alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and its analogues inhibited the uptake of both lactate and pyruvate competitively. Inhibition was also produced by treatment of cells with fluorodinitrobenzene but not with the thiol reagents or Pronase. At high concentrations of pyruvate or lactate (20mM), uptake of the carboxylate was accompanied by an efflux of Cl-ions. This efflux of Cl- was inhibited by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and picrate and could be totally abolished by very low (less than 10 muM) concentrations of the inhibitor of Cl- transport, 4,4'-di-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid. This inhibitor titrated out the chlordie efflux induced by pyruvate, bicarbonate, formate and fluoride, in each case total inhibition becoming apparent when approximately 1.2x10(6) molecules of inhibitor were present per erythrocyte, that is, about one inhibitor molecule per molecule of the Cl- carrier. Evan when Cl- efflux was totally blocked pyruvate and lactate uptake occurred. Kinetic evidence is presented which suggests that the Cl- carrier can transport pyruvate and lactate with a high Km and high Vmax., but that an additional carrier with a low Km and a low Vmax. also exists. This carrier catalyses the exchange of small carboxylate anions with intracellular lactate, is competitively inhibited by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and non-competitively inhibited by picrate. The Cl- carrier shows a reverse pattern of inhibition. It is concluded that net efflux of lactic acid from the cell must occur on the Cl- carrier and involve exchange with HCO3 - followed by loss of CO2. The low Km carrier might be used in pyruvate/lactate or acetoacetate/beta-hydroxybutyrate exchanges involved in transferring reducing power across the cell membrane. The possibility that the Cl- carrier exists in cells other than the erythrocyte is discussed. It is concluded that its presence in other cell membranes together with a low intracellular Cl- concentration would explain why the pH in the cytoplasm is lower than that of the blood, and why permeable carboxylate anions do not accumulate within the cell when added from outside.

9514|a|Transient extracellular pH changes accompany the exchange of chloride for sulfate across the erythrocyte membrane. The direction of the extracellular pH change during chloride efflux and sulfate influx depends on experimental conditions. When bicarbonate is present, the extracellular pH drops sharply at the outset of the anion exchange and tends to follow the partial ionic equilibrium described by Wilbrandt (W. Wilbrandt, 1942. Pfluegers Arch. 246:291). When bicarbonate is absent, however, the anion exchange causes the pH to rise, indicating that protons are cotransported with sulfate during chloride-sulfate exchange. The pH rise can be reversed by the addition of HCO(-3) (4 muM) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (90 muM). This demonstrates that the proton-sulfate cotransport can drive proton transport uphill. The stoichiometry of the transport is that one chloride exchanges for one sulfate plus one proton. These results support the titratable carrier model proposed by Gunn (Gunn, R.B. 1972, In: Oxygen Affinity of Hemoglobin and Red Cell Acid-Base Status. M. Rorth and P. Astrup, editors. p. 823. Munksgaard, Copenhagen) for erythrocyte membrane anion exchange.

6276495|a|The kinetics of human red blood cell Cl transport have been studied under nonequilibrium conditions to determine whether or not an outward Cl gradient can recruit the transport protein from an inward-facing to an outward-facing configuration. Three kinds of evidence are consistent with this outward recruitment. First, the initial net Cl efflux into a Cl-free phosphate medium is independent of the intracellular Cl concentration in the range 20-170 mM. Second, an outward Cl gradient strongly enhances the inhibitory potency of DNDS (4,4'-dinitro-2,2'-stilbene disulfonate), which suggests that DNDS binds primarily to outward-facing states. Finally, we have estimated the number of Cl ions transported during the putative outward recruitment. Resealed red cell ghosts containing only 70 muM 36Cl were resuspended at 0 degrees C in a Cl-free, HCO3-free Na2SO4 medium. In the first 10 s, or approximately 10(6) Cl ions per ghost, followed by a much slower further loss of Cl. The rapid loss of 10(6) Cl ions per ghost, which is abolished by pretreatment with DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulfonate), appears to represent the Cl that is transported during the first half-turnover of the transport cycle. These data are strong evidence that the influx and efflux events in the catalytic cycle for anion transport do not take place simultaneously, and that the stoichiometry of the transport cycle is close to one pair of anions exchanged per band 3 monomer.

3171537|a|A recently developed method for converting protein carboxyl groups to alcohols has been used to examine the functional role of carboxyl groups in the red blood cell inorganic anion-transport protein (band 3). A major goal of the work was to investigate the carboxyl group that is protonated during the proton-sulfate cotransport that takes place during net chloride-sulfate exchange. Three kinds of evidence indicate that the chemical modification (Woodward's reagent K followed by borohydride) converts this carboxyl to an alcohol. First, monovalent anion exchange is inhibited irreversibly. Second, the modification stimulates sulfate influx into chloride-loaded cells and nearly eliminates the extracellular pH dependence of the sulfate influx. (The stimulated sulfate influx in the modified cells is inhibitable by stilbenedisulfonate.) Third, the proton influx normally associated with chloride-sulfate exchange is inhibited by the modification. These results would all be expected if the titratable carboxyl group were converted into the untitratable, neutral alcohol. In addition to altering the extracellular pH dependence of sulfate influx, the chemical modification removes the intracellular pH dependence of sulfate efflux. The modification is performed under conditions in which the reagent does not cross the permeability barrier. The large effect on the intracellular pH dependence of sulfate transport suggests that a single carboxyl group can at different times be in contact with the aqueous medium on each side of the permeability barrier.

1647439|a|The mechanism of activation of KCl cotransport has been examined in rabbit red blood cells. Previous work has provided evidence that a net dephosphorylation is required for activation of transport by cell swelling. In the present study okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases, was used to test this idea in more detail. We find that okadaic acid strongly inhibits swelling-stimulated KCl cotransport. The IC50 for okadaic acid is approximately 40 nM, consistent with the involvement of type 1 protein phosphatase in transport activation. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) is well known to activate KCl cotransport in cells of normal volume. Okadaic acid, added before NEM, inhibits the activation of transport by NEM, indicating that a dephosphorylation is necessary for the NEM effect. Okadaic acid added after NEM inhibits transport only very slightly. After a brief exposure to NEM and rapid removal of unreacted NEM, KCl cotransport activates with a time delay that is similar to that for swelling activation. Okadaic acid causes a slight increase in the delay time. These findings are all consistent with the idea that NEM activates transport not by a direct action on the transport protein but by altering a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. The simplest hypothesis that is consistent with the data is that both cell swelling and NEM cause inhibition of a protein kinase. Kinase inhibition causes net dephosphorylation of some key substrate (not necessarily the transport protein); dephosphorylation of this substrate, probably by type 1 protein phosphatase, causes transport activation.

1352774|a|The band 3 protein of the human red blood cell membrane contains a glutamate residue that must be protonated in order for divalent (SO4=) anion transport to take place at an appreciable rate. The carboxyl side chain on this glutamate residue can be converted to the primary alcohol by treatment of intact cells with Woodward's reagent K (N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium 3'-sulfonate) followed by reductive cleavage with BH4-. Edman degradation of CNBr fragments from band 3 labeled in intact cells with Woodward's reagent K and [3H]BH4- showed that Glu681 is heavily labeled under conditions in which Cl- exchange is inhibited, SO4= exchange is accelerated, and Cl- conductance is accelerated. No other glutamate residue in band 3 is detectably labeled under the conditions of these experiments, as demonstrated either by Edman degradation or by the lack of label in major known proteolytic fragments. It is concluded that Glu681 is the binding site for the H+ that is transported with SO4= during band 3-catalyzed H+/SO4= cotransport. This residue is conserved among all species of red cell band 3 (AE1) as well as the related proteins AE2 and AE3. Glu681 is the first amino acid residue in band 3 which has been identified as a binding site for a transported substrate (H+). The functional characteristics of this residue suggest that it lies within the transport pathway and can be alternately exposed to the intracellular and extracellular media.

6707024|a|The structure of the human red blood cell membrane band 3 protein has been investigated by proteolysis of intact cells with papain. Papain cleaves the 35,000-dalton chymotryptic peptide (CH35) of band 3 into two integral fragments of Mr 7,500 (P7) and 28,000 (P28). The papain cleavage of CH35 causes inhibition of band 3-catalyzed Cl transport. The peptide P28 carries the band 3 carbohydrate and also contains the 2 cysteine residues in CH35. The anion transport inhibitor H2DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate) reacts covalently with a lysine residue on P28, rather than P7, in native band 3. However, if the cells are first digested with papain and then reacted with H2DIDS, there is significant covalent reaction with P7, producing a covalent cross-link between P7 and the 60,000-dalton chymotryptic peptide (CH60). Graded papain digestion experiments and end group determinations indicate that the alignment of the band 3 peptides is N-CH60-P7-P28-COOH. The NH2-terminal sequence of P7 is identical with a segment of a peptic fragment of band 3 recently sequenced (Brock, C.J., Tanner, M.J.A., and Kempf, C. (1983) Biochem. J. 213, 577-586). This published sequence, plus our sequence data on CH35 and P7, show that papain cleaves the outer surface of CH35 at two sites, which are 6 residues and 71 residues from the chymotrypsin cleavage site. The 65-residue peptide (P7) between these sites is the best characterized segment of band 3 thus far described: its sequence and location in the band 3 primary structure are now known, and both ends of the peptide are unambiguously exofacial.

2280255|a|Tracer anion exchange flux measurements have been carried out in human red blood cells with the membrane potential clamped at various values with gramicidin. The goal of the study was to determine the effect of membrane potential on the anion translocation and binding events in the catalytic cycle for exchange. The conditions were arranged such that most of the transporters were recruited into the same configuration (inward-facing or outward-facing, depending on the direction of the Cl- gradient). We found that the membrane potential has no detectable effect on the anion translocation event, measured as 36Cl(-)-Cl- or 36Cl(-)-HCO3- exchange. The lack of effect of potential is in agreement with previous studies on red cells and is different from the behavior of the mouse erythroid band 3 gene expressed in frog oocytes (Grygorczyk, R., W. Schwarz, and H. Passow. 1987. J. Membr. Biol. 99:127-136). A negative potential decreases the potency of extracellular SO4= as an inhibitor of either Cl- or HCO3- influx. Because of the potential-dependent inhibition by SO4=, conditions could be found in which a negative intracellular potential actually accelerates 36Cl- influx. This effect is observed only in media containing multivalent anions. The simplest interpretation of the effect is that the negative potential lowers the inhibitory potency of the multivalent anion by lowering its local concentration near the transport site. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with the idea that the anions move through 10-15% of the transmembrane potential between the extracellular medium and the outward-facing transport site. In contrast to its effect on extracellular substrate binding, there is no detectable effect of membrane potential on the competition between intracellular Cl- and SO4= for transport sites. The lack of effect of potential on intracellular substrate binding suggests that the access pathway leading to the inward-facing transport site is of lower electrical resistance than that leading to the extracellular substrate site.

2425624|a|Experiments were performed with intact human red blood cells to determine whether the inhibitory effects of high Cl- concentrations on Cl- exchange are primarily due to interaction at the cytoplasmic or the external surface of the membrane. When internal Cl- was varied from 150 mM to 600 mM Cl- (using the nystatin technique), keeping external Cl- constant at 150 mM (with sucrose added to maintain osmotic balance), Cl- exchange was inhibited almost exactly as much as when both internal and external Cl- were increased from 150 mM to 600 mM. On the other hand, if internal Cl- was maintained constant at 600 mM, variation of external Cl- (with either sucrose, gluconate, or citrate-sucrose mixtures replacing Cl-) had no consistent effect on Cl- exchange. Even if internal Cl- was kept at 150 mM by substitution of gluconate for Cl-, an increase in external Cl- from 150 mM to 600 mM did not significantly inhibit Cl- exchange. Thus the self-inhibitory effects of Cl- seem to be caused primarily by binding to a site at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. External Br-, on the other hand, did cause a significant inhibition of Cl- exchange. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of Cl- at neutral pH, at very high pH (around pH 11) there is an activation of Cl- exchange at very high Cl- concentrations. This effect, however, depends on binding of Cl- to an external site. Thus there seem to be at least two different low-affinity Cl- binding sites, one at the cytoplasmic side, which inhibits Cl- exchange, and one at the external side, which activates Cl- exchange at high external pH.

6736916|a|External N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)-2-aminoethylsulfonate (NAP-taurine) inhibits human red cell chloride exchange by binding to a site that is distinct from the chloride transport site. Increases in the intracellular chloride concentration (at constant external chloride) cause an increase in the inhibitory potency of external NAP-taurine. This effect is not due to the changes in pH or membrane potential that usually accompany a chloride gradient, since even when these changes are reversed or eliminated the inhibitory potency remains high. According to the ping-pong model for anion exchange, such transmembrane effects of intracellular chloride on external NAP-taurine can be explained if NAP-taurine only binds to its site when the transport site is in the outward-facing (Eo or EClo ) form. Since NAP-taurine prevents the conformational change from EClo to ECli , it must lock the system in the outward-facing form. NAP-taurine can therefore be used just like the competitive inhibitor H2DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyano-1,2- diphenylethane -2,2'-disulfonic acid) to monitor the fraction of transport sites that face outward. A quantitative analysis of the effects of chloride gradients on the inhibitory potency of NAP-taurine and H2DIDS reveals that the transport system is intrinsically asymmetric, such that when Cli = Clo, most of the unloaded transport sites face the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.

2764091|a|With Cl as substrate, the human red blood cell anion transport (band 3) protein can exist in four conformations: Ei, with the transport site facing the cytoplasm; Eo, with the transport site facing the external medium; and ECli and EClo, the corresponding forms loaded with Cl. Flufenamic acid (FA), an inhibitor that binds to an external site different from the transport site, binds to Eo with a dissociation constant of 0.0826 +/- 0.0049 (SE) microM. Binding of iodide or sulfate to the external-facing transport site reduces the affinity by 1.66 or 14.3-fold, respectively. Changing from Eo to Ei lowers the affinity by 3.7-fold, and binding of cytoplasmic iodide to Ei further decreases the affinity by 5.5-fold. Thus changes in orientation of the transport site and substrate binding, even at the opposite side of the membrane, cause sufficient conformational changes in band 3 to affect FA binding substantially. If the possible effects of Cl binding to the transport site on FA affinity are estimated from the iodide data, the dependence of FA inhibitory potency on Cl concentrations inside and outside the cell suggests that there are at least 6.5 times as many inward-facing as outward-facing Cl-loaded transport sites. This information can be used to calculate the distribution of capnophorin among the various conformations under different circumstances and to devise conditions for recruiting the transport molecules toward a particular conformation.

3003149|a|This study demonstrates the presence of oxalate transporters on the brush border membrane of rabbit ileum. We found that an inside alkaline (pH = 8.5 inside, 6.5 outside) pH gradient stimulated [14C]oxalate uptake 10-fold at 1 min with a fourfold accumulation above equilibrated uptake at 5 min. 1 mM 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (disodium salt; DIDS) profoundly inhibited the pH-gradient stimulated oxalate uptake. Using an inwardly directed K+ gradient and valinomycin, we found no evidence for potential sensitive oxalate uptake. In contrast to Cl:HCO3 exchange, HCO3 did not stimulate oxalate uptake more than was seen with a pH gradient in the absence of HCO3. An outwardly directed Cl gradient (50 mM inside, 5 mM outside) stimulated oxalate uptake 10-fold at 1 min with a fivefold accumulation above equilibrated uptake. Cl-stimulated oxalate uptake was largely inhibited by DIDS. Addition of K+ and nigericin only slightly decreased the Cl gradient-stimulated oxalate uptake, which indicates that this stimulation was not primarily due to the Cl gradient generating an inside alkaline pH gradient via Cl:OH exchange. Further, an outwardly directed oxalate gradient stimulated 36Cl uptake. These results suggested that both oxalate:OH and oxalate:Cl exchange occur on the brush border membrane. To determine if one or both of these exchanges were on contaminating basolateral membrane, the vesicle preparation was further fractionated into a brush border and basolateral component using sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Both exchangers localized to the brush border component. A number of organic anions were examined (outwardly directed gradient) to determine if they could stimulate oxalate and Cl uptake. Only formate and oxaloacetate were found to stimulate oxalate and Cl uptake. An inwardly directed Na gradient only slightly stimulated oxalate uptake, which was inhibited by DIDS.

2289848|a|The gene family of anion exchangers consists of at least four or five members, of which three have been characterized at the cDNA level. AE1-3 encode polypeptides that share significant homology with the erythrocyte anion exchanger, band 3 (AE1). Expression of cDNAs encoding these genes in heterologous systems confirms that this sequence similarity is reflected in the capacity to mediate reversible Cl/HCO3 exchange. While the NH2-terminal domain of band 3 is known to interact with several cytoplasmic proteins in erythrocytes, the function of the analogous domains of AE2 and AE3 remains unknown. The AE1 gene is expressed coordinately with other erythroid genes during erythropoiesis in both avian and mammalian erythroid progenitor cells. In addition, AE1 is expressed at the basolateral plasma membrane of the acid-secreting intercalated cells of the kidney. AE2 is expressed in a number of epithelial and nonepithelial cells; it may be expressed in the Golgi apparatus of some of these cells. AE3 is expressed in excitable tissues, including neurons and muscle. It is likely that these proteins play a role in regulation of intracellular pH and chloride in their respective tissue. Understanding of the physiological roles of these proteins, both for ion transport and for plasma membrane organization, remains a central issue.

454583|a|The effects of a variety of chemically diverse, reversibly acting inhibitors have been measured on both Cl- and SO2-4 equilibrium exchange across the human red cell membrane. The measurements were carried out under the same conditions (pH 6.3, 8 degrees C) and in the same medium for both the Cl- and SO2-4 tracer fluxes. Under these conditions the rate constant for Cl--Cl- exchange is about 20,000 times larger than that for SO2-4--SO2-4 exchange. Despite this large difference in the rates of transport of the two anions, eight different reversibly acting inhibitors have virtually the same effect on the Cl- and SO2-4 transport. The proteolytic enzyme papain also has the same inhibitory effect on both the Cl- and SO2-4 self-exchange. In addition, the slowly penetrating disulfonate 2-(4'-aminophenyl)-6-methylbenzenethiazol-3',7-disulfonic acid (APMB) is 5-fold more effective from the outer than from the inner membrane surface in inhibiting both Cl- and SO2-4 self-exchange. We interpret these results as evidence that the rapidly penetrating monovalent anion Cl- and the slowly penetrating divalent anion SO2-4 are transported by the same system.

3335537|a|The effects of varying extracellular pH on the rates of uptake of titratable anions by human erythrocytes under conditions of constant intracellular pH have been determined for a series of highly related anions, the phosphate "analogs." These compounds are simply substituted phosphorus oxyacids, differing in the number and acidity of titratable protons: phosphate (HPO4(2-), pKa 6.8); phosphite (HPO3(2-), pKa 6.4); hypophosphite (H2PO2-); methylphosphonate ((CH3)PO3(2-), pKa 7.4); dimethylphosphinate ((CH3)2PO2-); fluorophosphate [PO3F2-, pKa 4.7); and thiophosphate (HSPO3(2-), pKa 5.5). Suspensions of intact, Cl(-)-loaded erythrocytes (intracellular pH, 7.2) were incubated at 37 degrees C in isotonic buffers (pH 4-8) containing 60 mM phosphate analog for specified time intervals, whereupon influx was halted by the addition of 1 mM 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS), an inhibitor of anion exchange. The intracellular anion concentrations were determined from 31P or 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectra from the erythrocyte suspensions. The influx rates for the titratable phosphate analogs exhibited bimodal pH dependence, reaching maximal levels at pH values that increased with increasing anion pK. This pH-dependent behavior is consistent with a transport channel that contains a titratable regulatory site which interacts with the translocated anion. Based upon the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the probability that a titratable anion will have an electric charge of equal magnitude to that of the titratable carrier is highest at a pH value exactly midway between the pK of the regulatory site and that of the anion. The pH maxima observed for the phosphate analogs indicate a pK for this site of 5.5 at 37 degrees C. Intracellular pH changes associated with influx indicated that transport of the "fast" anion phosphite is largely in monoionized form. Intracellular pH changes associated with transport of slow anions were predominantly determined by partial ionic equilibrium effects and did not indicate the ionization state of the transported anion.

3558357|a|The cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (cdb3) of the human erythrocyte membrane is a good substrate of endogenous and exogenous protein-tyrosine kinases. Because one site of tyrosine phosphorylation is within the glycolytic enzyme/hemoglobin-binding region at the N terminus of the polypeptide, we have investigated whether tyrosine phosphorylation of cdb3 might influence its interaction with the above peripheral proteins. Using p40, a protein-tyrosine kinase isolated from bovine thymus, we demonstrate that aldolase binding to cdb3 linked to Affi-Gel 15 is significantly inhibited by phosphorylation of the immobilized band 3. Importantly, upon dephosphorylation of the gel with acid phosphatase, aldolase binding returns to prephosphorylated values. Similarly, cdb3 phosphorylation was found to inhibit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, and hemoglobin binding to immobilized cdb3. In the converse experiment, untreated soluble cdb3 was shown to bind to immobilized aldolase, whereas phosphorylated cdb3 (approximately equal to 1.8 mol of Pi/mol of cdb3) did not. Furthermore, phosphorylated cdb3 was unable to inhibit aldolase catalysis, whereas untreated cdb3, as shown previously by others, was a potent inhibitor. Taken together, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of cdb3 on tyrosine residues inhibits peripheral protein binding at the polypeptide's N terminus. In view of the known effect of glycolytic enzyme binding to band 3 on catalytic activity, tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 may modulate glycolysis in vivo.

3700362|a|The transport of phosphoenolpyruvate across the erythrocyte membrane was compared with the transport of inorganic phosphate in resealed ghosts of human erythrocytes. Two conditions were employed: in one, the external pH (pHe) was varied from 6.0 to 7.5 while internal pH (pHi) was maintained at 7.2 or 6.2, whereas in the other, the internal and external pH were adjusted to have the same value over a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. At a constant pHi of 7.2, the pH profile for the transport of phosphoenolpyruvate was different from that of inorganic phosphate; both pH profiles were similar to those previously observed in intact erythrocytes (Deuticke, B. (1970) Naturwissenschaften 57, 172-179; Hamasaki, N., et al. (1978) Biochem. J. 170, 39-46). In the absence of a transmembrane pH gradient, the pH profile for phosphoenolpyruvate transport was bell-shaped with the maximum at pH 6.8, and essentially the same pattern was seen with inorganic phosphate transport. The different pH profiles obtained under the two conditions suggests that one or more residues exposed at the inner surface of the membrane participate in the transport of inorganic phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate. One of the most likely candidates is a histidine residue of the transport protein.

The Dixon plots of 1/MCl vs. [SO4] at different proton concentrations were not parallel. Thus protons and sulfate ions were not mutually exclusive inhibitors. The slope of these Dixon plots was independent of pH above 7.0, which indicates that sulfate could bind to the unprotonated carrier and excludes the first two mechanisms. Protons were inhibitors of chloride flux in the absence of sulfate, which indicates that protons could bind to the unloaded carrier and excludes mechanism 3. The KI for sulfate was 4.35 +/0 0.36 mM. The pK for the protonatable group was 5.03 +/- 0.02. The binding of either a proton or sulfate to the carrier decreased the KI of the other by ninefold. The only simple mechanism consistent with the data is a random-ordered mechanism with more transporters loaded with a sulfate than loaded with a proton at the pH and sulfate concentrations of plasma.

6089577|a|Sulfate influx into human red blood cells was measured at 0 and 22 degrees C at several fixed external pH values between 3 and 10. These cells had normal internal pH and chloride concentrations so that sulfate influx was not limited by the efflux half-cycle reactions. The flux was a Michaelis-Menten function of sulfate concentration at each pH with K1/2SO4 = 4-10 mM. External protons activated influx 100-fold at a single site with a pK = 5.9 at 22 degrees C and 5.5 at 0 degrees C. This pK is similar to the value 5.99 +/- 0.3 for external proton binding to the sulfate-loaded transporter at 0 degrees C (J. Gen. Physiol. 79: 87-114, 1982). The flux was stilbene sensitive even in valinomycin-treated cells and was independent of membrane potential. This proton-activated influx appears to be proton-sulfate cotransport. At high pH there was a proton-independent flux that was membrane potential and stilbene sensitive. This proton-insensitive flux appears to be SO4(2-)/Cl- exchange or net sulfate influx. The sulfate influx over the entire pH range may be described in terms of an equation for the sum of the influxes through these two pathways on band 3.

6799647|a|A 15% of band 3 protein, the assumed chloride channel, is associated with spectrin, the major peripheral protein of a lattice located at the red cell membrane-cytosol interface, the present study was undertaken to evaluate whether a rearrangement of the lattice modifies the functional property of band 3 protein. Such a rearrangement was modulated by depletion of cell ATP and/or by accumulation of Ca2+ ions within the cell. ATP depletion induces an inhibition of the electroneutral one-for-one chloride exchanges. Neither the modification of red cell morphology due to ATP depletion (discocyte-echinocyte transformation) nor a direct effect of the decrease in internal ATP level can account for this inhibition. On the other hand, it seems reasonable to consider that inhibition is related to the changes in membrane protein organization (formation of heteropolymers) induced by the decrease in ATP level. But it does not appear that the degree of inhibition is modified when this altered assembly of membrane protein is stabilized by disulfide linkages. Accumulation of Ca2+ ions in the cell at a relatively low concentration (10 micro M range) inhibits chloride exchange without apparent modification of the assembly of membrane proteins. This effect of calcium on chloride exchanges is speculatively denoted as a "direct" effect of calcium. Calcium loading of fresh red cells at higher concentrations (500 to 1000 micro M) obtained by use of the ionophore A23187 induces a very strong inhibition of chloride exchanges. In this case, inhibition can be reasonably accounted for by two simultaneous effects of calcium: a "direct" effect which explains half of the inhibition and an "indirect effect due to the formation of membrane protein complexes stabilized by covalent crosslinkages (activation by Ca2+ ions of a transglutaminase). It is interesting to note that intracellular calcium, whatever the level, inhibits electroneutral exchanges of chloride but increases net chloride movements.

8458871|a|Folding and oligomerization of most plasma membrane glycoproteins, including those involved in ion transport, occur in the ER and are frequently required for their exit from this organelle. It is currently unknown, however, where or when in the biosynthetic pathway these proteins become functionally active. AE1 and AE2 are tissue-specific, plasma membrane anion transport proteins. Transient expression of AE2 in a eukaryotic cell line leads to an increase in stilbene inhibitable whole cell 35SO4(2-)-efflux consistent with its function as a plasma membrane anion exchanger. No such increased transport activity was observed in AE1 transfectants, despite the fact that the two proteins were synthesized in roughly equal portions. In contrast, both AE1 and AE2 expression resulted in significant increase in Cl-/SO4(2-)-exchange in crude microsomes demonstrating that both AE1 and AE2 cDNAs encode functional proteins. Immunofluorescence staining and pulse-chase labeling experiments revealed that while 60% of AE2 is processed to the cell surface of transfectants, AE1 is restricted to an intracellular compartment and never acquires mature oligosaccharides. Crude microsomes from transfected cells were fractionated into plasma membrane and ER-derived vesicles by con A affinity chromatography. All of the AE1 and approximately half of the cellular AE2 was eluted with the ER vesicles, confirming their intracellular localization. Anion transport measurements on these fractions confirmed that the ER-restricted anion exchangers were functional. We conclude that AE1 and AE2 acquire the ability to mediate anion exchange at an early stage of their biosynthesis, before their exit from the ER.

1538763|a|Hereditary ovalocytosis is common in some areas of Melanesia and South East Asia where malaria is endemic. These red cells resist invasion by malarial parasites in vitro and ovalocytic individuals are less parasitized than normal. This has been attributed to the greater rigidity of ovalocytic red cells. It has been suggested that South East Asian ovalocytosis results from the heterozygous presence of an altered membrane anion transporter (band 3). We have used the polymerase chain reaction to clone the abnormal band 3 complementary DNA from an ovalocytic of Indian origin and found two changes from the normal protein: a point mutation (Lys 56----Glu) and the deletion of the sequence AFSPQVLAA (residues 400-408), but no evidence for an N-terminal extension. The deletion is also found in the abnormal band 3 of South East Asian ovalocytes and seems to be responsible for the unusual properties of the ovalocytic red cell. We show here that the membrane domain of the abnormal ovalocyte band 3 has a substantially altered structure and that the protein is defective in anion transport activity. The changed transport properties of the red cells may have a role in the reduced parasitaemia of ovalocytic individuals.

512956|a|1. Bicarbonate transport across human red cell membranes was studied between 0 and 10 degrees C at alkaline pH values by determining the efflux of 14C-labelled bicarbonate from resealed erythrocyte ghosts. Transfer of labelled CO2 was eliminated as a source of error, when formation of intracellular 14CO2 was inhibited with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The study showed that there are no fundamental differences between the characteristics of bicarbonate and of chloride self-exchange as has been inferred from previous studies of chloride-bicarbonate exchange. 2. Efflux of radioactivity could be reduced more than 99% by reversible and irreversible inhibitors of anion transport. Inhibition of both chloride and bicarbonate self-exchange was linearly related to the binding of 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS) to the membranes. Complete (i.e. greater than 99%) inhibition was obtained after binding of 1.2 x 10(6) DIDS molecules per cell. 3. Bicarbonate self-exchange proved a saturable function of bicarbonate concentration, with a maximum at external and internal concentrations of approximately 100 mM, showing self-depression at higher bicarbonate concentrations, and half-maximum exchange flux at a concentration of 10 mM. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that the exchange mechanism has two anion binding sites, one mediating ion transport and the other causing transport inhibition. 4. Maximum exchange flux of bicarbonate was about 30% larger thant that of chloride, and the affinity of bicarbonate for the transport site was about three times larger than that of chloride. The apparent activation energy of bicarbonate exchange was 28 kcal/mole, the same order of magnitude as found for other inorganic anions between 0 and 10 degrees C. 5. The ability of other inorganic anions to exchange with bicarbonate decreased in the sequence Cl greater than NO3 greater than F greater than Br greater than or equal to I, corresponding to the sequence of the rate of self-exchange of halides. 6. Counter-transport of bicarbonate could be driven by a chloride gradient, when ghosts containing KCl were suspended in a medium containing traces of labelled bicarbonate in addition to a non-permeating anion. Concentration ratios (ci/co) up to about 1000 could be obtained. 7. It is concluded that bicarbonate is transported by the inorganic anion exchange mechanism of the erythrocyte membrane. The slight differences between the exchange kinetics of chloride and bicarbonate were explained by differing affinities of the two anions for the two anion binding sites of the transport system.

6130537|a|About 80% of the CO2 formed by metabolism is transported from tissues to lungs as bicarbonate ions in the water phases of red cells and plasma. The catalysed hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate takes place in the erythrocytes but most of the bicarbonate thus formed must be exchanged with extracellular chloride to make full use of the carbon dioxide transporting capacity of the blood. The anion transport capacity of the red cell membrane is among the largest ionic transport capacities of any biological membrane. Exchange diffusion of chloride and bicarbonate is nevertheless a rate-limiting step for the transfer of CO2 from tissues to lungs. Measurements of chloride and bicarbonate self-exchange form the basis for calculations that demonstrate that the ionic exchange processes cannot run to complete equilibration at capillary transit times less than 0.5 s. The anion exchange diffusion is mediated by a large transmembrane protein constituting almost 30% of the total membrane protein. The kinetics of exchange diffusion must depend on conformational changes of the protein molecule, associated with the binding and subsequent translocation of the transported anion. We have characterized the nature of anion-binding sites facing the extracellular medium by acid-base titration of the transport function and modification of the transport protein in situ with group-specific amino acid reagents. Anion binding and translocation depend on the integrity and the degree of protonation of two sets of exofacial groups with apparent pK values of 12 and 5, respectively. From the chemical reactivities towards amino acid reagents it appears that the groups whose pK = 12 are guanidino groups of arginyl residues, while the groups whose pK = 5 are likely to be carboxylates of glutamic or aspartic acid. Our studies suggest that the characteristics of anion recognition sites in water-soluble proteins and in the integral transport proteins are closely related.

1998697|a|The human red cell anion-exchanger, band 3 protein, is one of the main phosphorylated proteins of the erythrocyte membrane. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that ATP-depletion of the red blood cell decreased the anion-exchange rate, suggesting that band 3 protein phosphorylation could be involved in the regulation of anion transport function (Bursaux et al. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 777, 253-260). Phosphorylation occurs mainly on the cytoplasmic domain of the protein and the major site of phosphorylation was assigned to tyrosine-8 (Dekowski et al. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2750-2753). This site being very far from the integral, anion-exchanger domain, the aim of the present study was to determine whether phosphorylation sites exist in the integral domain. The phosphorylation reaction was carried out on isolated membranes in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP and phosphorylated band 3 protein was then isolated. Both the cytoplasmic and the membrane spanning domains were purified. The predominant phosphorylation sites were found on the cytoplasmic domain. RP-HPLC analyses of the tryptic peptides of whole band 3 protein, and of the isolated cytoplasmic and membrane-spanning domains allowed for the precise localization of the phosphorylated residues. 80% of the label was found in the N-terminal tryptic peptide (T-1), (residues 1-56). In this region, all the residues susceptible to phosphorylation were labeled but in varying proportion. Under our conditions, the most active membrane kinase was a tyrosine kinase, activated preferentially by Mn2+ but also by Mg2+. Tyrosine-8 was the main phosphate acceptor residue (50-70%) of the protein, tyrosine-21 and tyrosine-46 residues were also phosphorylated but to a much lesser extent. The main targets of membrane casein kinase, preferentially activated by Mg2+, were serine-29, serine-50, and threonine(s)-39, -42, -44, -48, -49, -54 residue(s) located in the T-1 peptide. A tyrosine phosphatase activity was copurified with whole band 3 protein which dephosphorylates specifically P-Tyr-8, indicating a highly exchangeable phosphate. The membrane-spanning fragment was only faintly labeled.

2071575|a|Involvement of acidic cell compartments in processing and action of cholera toxin (CT) in rat liver has been examined using subcellular fractionation. Liver cell fractions prepared various times after CT injection display, after a lag phase, a progressive increase in adenylate cyclase activity, detectable earlier in Golgi-endosomal fractions (20 min) than in plasma membrane fractions (30 min), with a maximum (3-fold basal activity) achieved by 60-90 min. Endosomes containing in vivo internalized CT display a time-dependent increase in their ability to bind anti-A-subunit antibodies and to stimulate exogenous adenylate cyclase, which kinetically parallels the generation of A1 peptide, suggesting a translocation of A-subunit (or A1 peptide) across the endosomal membrane. In vivo chloroquine treatment inhibits endocytosis of CT taken up into the liver, lengthens the lag phase for adenylate cyclase activation by CT, and reduces by 3- to 10-fold the apparent affinity of the toxin for the enzyme. Incubation of endosomes containing internalized toxin at 37 degrees C under isotonic conditions results in a pH-dependent increase in generation of A1 peptide, membrane translocation of A-subunit (or A1 peptide), and degradation of toxin, with a maximum at pH 5. Addition of ATP, by decreasing the internal endosomal pH, stimulates both generation of the A1 peptide and degradation of toxin at pH 6-8. It is concluded that activation of adenylate cyclase by CT in intact liver requires association and subsequent processing of toxin in an acidic cell compartment, presumably endosomal.

1318883|a|The massive secretion of salt and water in cholera-induced diarrhea involves binding of cholera toxin (CT) to ganglioside GM1 in the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, translocation of the enzymatically active A1-peptide across the membrane, and subsequent activation of adenylate cyclase located on the cytoplasmic surface of the basolateral membrane. Studies on nonpolarized cells show that CT is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and that the A1-subunit may remain membrane associated. To test the hypothesis that toxin action in polarized cells may involve intracellular movement of toxin-containing membranes, monolayers of the polarized intestinal epithelial cell line T84 were mounted in modified Ussing chambers and the response to CT was examined. Apical CT at 37 degrees C elicited a short circuit current (Isc: 48 +/- 2.1 microA/cm2; half-maximal effective dose, ED50 integral of 0.5 nM) after a lag of 33 +/- 2 min which bidirectional 22Na+ and 36Cl- flux studies showed to be due to electrogenic Cl- secretion. The time course of the CT-induced Isc response paralleled the time course of cAMP generation. The dose response to basolateral toxin at 37 degrees C was identical to that of apical CT but lag times (24 +/- 2 min) and initial rates were significantly less. At 20 degrees C, the Isc response to apical CT was more strongly inhibited (30-50%) than the response to basolateral CT, even though translocation occurred in both cases as evidenced by the formation of A1-peptide. A functional rhodamine-labeled CT-analogue applied apically or basolaterally at 20 degrees C was visualized only within endocytic vesicles close to apical or basolateral membranes, whereas movement into deeper apical structures was detected at 37 degrees C. At 15 degrees C, in contrast, reduction to the A1-peptide was completely inhibited and both apical and basolateral CT failed to stimulate Isc although Isc responses to 1 nM vasoactive intestinal peptide, 10 microM forskolin, and 3 mM 8Br-cAMP were intact. Re-warming above 32 degrees C restored CT-induced Isc. Preincubating monolayers for 30 min at 37 degrees C before cooling to 15 degrees C overcame the temperature block of basolateral CT but the response to apical toxin remained completely inhibited. These results identify a temperature-sensitive step essential to apical toxin action on polarized epithelial cells. We suggest that this event involves vesicular transport of toxin-containing membranes beyond the apical endosomal compartment.

The sequence of anion selectivity of cAMP-regulated channels in cells containing either endogenous or recombinant CFTR was bromide greater than chloride greater than iodide greater than fluoride. Mutation of the lysines at positions 95 or 335 to acidic amino acids converted the selectivity sequence to iodide greater than bromide greater than chloride greater than fluoride.

3971965|a|ADP-ribosylation of membrane proteins from rabbit small intestinal epithelium was investigated following incubation of membranes with [32P]NAD and cholera toxin. Cholera toxin catalyzes incorporation of 32P into three proteins of 40 kDA, 45 kDa and 47 kDa located in the brush-border membrane. In contrast, basal lateral membranes do not contain any protein which becomes labeled in a toxin-dependent manner when incubated with cholera toxin and [32P]NAD. The modification of membrane proteins from brush border occurred in spite of the virtual absence in these membranes of adenylate cyclase activatable either by cholera toxin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or fluoride. The three agents activated adenylate cyclase when crude plasma membrane were used. Cholera toxin activated fivefold at 10 micrograms/ml. Vasoactive intestinal peptide activated at concentrations from 10-300 nM, the maximal stimulation being sixfold. Fluoride activated 10-fold at 10 mM. When basal lateral membranes were assayed for adenylate cyclase it was found that, with respect to the crude membranes, the specific activity of fluoride-activated enzyme was 3.3-fold higher, VIP stimulated enzyme was maintained while cholera-toxin-stimulated enzyme showed half specific activity. Moreover, while fluoride stimulated ninefold and VIP stimulated fivefold, cholera toxin only stimulated twofold at the highest concentration. The results suggest that the activation by cholera toxin of adenylate cyclase located at the basal lateral membrane requires ADPribosylation of proteins in the brush border membrane.

8382647|a|An important approach to the major health problem of bacterial infection in young children has been to examine bacterial toxin binding to microvillus membrane receptors, the signal transduction produced by that interaction and the mechanisms of fluid secretion in the developing intestine as a basis for toxigenic diarrhea in the infant population. These studies indicate that receptor binding and effector responses may be subjected to developmental regulation. This regulation process of toxin interaction with the developing intestine may have an enhanced or harmful effect or, under some circumstances, may have a beneficial effect and be protective to the vulnerable child. Specific mechanisms for the developmental control of receptor expression may involve the regulation of individual glycosyltransferases responsible for the addition of receptor sugar sequences to glycolipids and/or glycoproteins, presumably at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, although highly speculative at this point, the differential expression of signal transducers (e.g., guanine nucleotide-regulatory proteins or G proteins) and ion transporters (e.g., Na+,K(+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase, the Cl- channels, etc.) during development may also alter the neonatal host's responsiveness. Therefore, the developmental control of microvillus membrane receptors, signal transduction mechanisms, and ion transport systems in the gastro-intestinal tract may in part contribute to the altered host sensitivity in toxigenic diarrhea of infancy.

3086867|a|We have cloned cDNAs encoding alpha subunits of the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins Gs, Gi, and Go and determined their nucleotide sequences. Purified preparations of Gi and Go alpha subunits (Gi alpha and Go alpha) from rat brain were completely digested with trypsin, and peptides were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. By screening of a cDNA library from rat C6 glioma cells with a synthetic probe corresponding to a 17 amino acid sequence, a clone encoding the sequence of Go alpha was obtained. Then, the library was rescreened with a Go alpha cDNA probe to isolate several strongly or weakly hybridizing clones. cDNAs encoding the complete sequences of Gi alpha and Gs alpha were thus obtained. From nucleotide sequence analysis, the amino acid sequences of Gs alpha and Gi alpha were deduced; they contain 394 and 355 amino acid residues (including the initiator methionine), respectively. The calculated molecular weights for Gs alpha and Gi alpha were 45,663 and 40,499, respectively. The Go alpha clone encoded a sequence of 310 amino acid residues that lacked the NH2 terminus. The homology of the alpha subunits of Gs, Gi, Go, transducin, and ras-encoded protein is discussed.

3127824|a|The gene for Gs alpha (the alpha subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs) was isolated from human genomic libraries using rat Gs alpha cDNA as a probe. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the human gene with that of the rat cDNA revealed that the human Gs alpha gene spans approximately equal to 20 kilobases and is composed of 13 exons and 12 introns. Genomic Southern blot analysis suggests that the human haploid genome contains a single Gs alpha gene. Previous reports indicated the presence of multiple species of Gs alpha cDNA. The structure of the human Gs alpha gene suggests that four types of Gs alpha mRNAs may be generated from a single Gs alpha gene by alternate use of exon 3 and/or of two 3' splice sites of intron 3, where an unusual splice junction sequence (TG) instead of the consensus (AG) is used. S1 nuclease mapping analysis of human Gs alpha mRNA identified multiple transcriptional initiation sites. The promoter region of the human Gs alpha gene has extremely high G + C content (85%). It contains 4 "GC" boxes, but no typical "TATA" or "CAAT" box sequence. In the 5' flanking region, there are several blocks of sequences that are similar to the sequences of the 5' flanking region of the human c-Ki-ras2 gene.

210449|a|In the presence of ATP and a cytosolic factor, cholera toxin fragment A1 catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to a number of soluble and membrane-bound proteins of the pigeon erythrocyte. Evidence is presented that suggests that the most readily modified membrane protein (Mr 42,000) is the adenylate cyclase-associated GTP-binding protein. Its modification by toxin is stimulated by guanine nucleotides. Adenylate cyclase activity increases in parallel with the addition of ADP-ribose to this protein and decreases in parallel with the subsequent reversal of ADP-ribosylation by toxin and nicotinamide. The protein is only accessible to toxin A subunits if the erythrocytes are lysed. When adenylate cyclase activity reaches a maximum, the number of ADP-ribose residues bound to this protein (about 1500 per cell) is similar to the reported number of beta-adrenergic receptors.

2704586|a|To determine if developmental variations existed in the second messenger system that mediates cholera toxin (CT) action, the adenylate cyclase (AC) response was studied in 2-wk-old suckling and 6-wk-old weaned rats. AC was assayed in the proximal small intestine 4 h after intraduodenal administration of various doses of CT. Dose-effect analysis showed a 9-fold increase in the sensitivity of the CT-activated cyclase response in suckling rats when measured by the ED50, expressed as microgram CT/g body wt (0.03 for 2 wk, 0.27 for 6 wk). When the CT dose was expressed as microgram/animal, suckling rats were 50 times more sensitive than 6-wk-old rats. In addition, the CT-induced fluid secretion was closely correlated with the elevated cyclase activities (correlation coefficient: 0.83 for 2 wk, 0.93 for 6 wk). Furthermore, more fluid seemed to be secreted/unit wt of gut in the sucklings, even when the same level of enzyme activity was compared. A maximum of 3- to 4-fold rise in AC activation occurred at 0.5 microgram CT/g body wt, but both the basal and the maximal stimulated levels of AC were not developmentally different. This study demonstrates an in vivo increase in AC responsiveness to CT that may be in part responsible for the increased incidence of toxigenic diarrhea in neonates.

2536237|a|To assess the influence of immaturity on the responsiveness of enterocytes to specific pathogens, a dose-response curve for cholera toxin (CT)-induced fluid secretion was determined in the proximal small intestine of rats at 2 and 4 wk of age. The suckling rat was approximately 50 times more sensitive to CT in triggering the secretory response than the weaned rat, when estimated by the medium-effective dose (ED50, 0.8 vs. 38.9 nM). Cortisone, known to promote enterocyte maturation, when injected into suckling rats, decreased host sensitivity approximately 1,000 times. Neither age nor cortisone decreased the receptor binding of 125I-labeled CT to intestinal microvillus membranes. In contrast, cortisone treatment caused a threefold increase in receptor density from 14.5 to 43.0 pmol/mg protein. The enzyme responsible for the sodium pump, Na+-K+-ATPase, showed a threefold increase in activity both after weaning and after a cortisone treatment. These data indicate that the immature gut exhibited an increased host sensitivity to CT stimulation that was not correlated with initial receptor binding but was related to a lowered Na+-K+-ATPase activity, suggesting that an underdeveloped sodium pump may be partially responsible for the high incidence of secretory diarrhea in neonates.

3773893|a|beta-Interferon (beta-IFN) gene expression can be induced by poly(I)-poly(C) or virus, but there is considerable variation in the extent of induction between different cell lines. We characterized two poorly inducible human cell lines, HeLa and 143 thymidine kinase negative (143 tk-), to define cellular factors involved in the activation of the beta-IFN gene. We show that the deficiency in beta-IFN induction in these cells can be complemented by fusion to highly inducible mouse cells. We conclude that the human cells are deficient in a trans-acting factor required for B-IFN gene activation. The level of induction of the beta-IFN gene in HeLa and 143 tk- cells can also be increased by priming with IFN before induction. If IFN priming is carried out in the presence of cycloheximide, a approximately 200-fold increase in induction is observed. We conclude that activation of the beta-IFN gene requires an IFN-inducible factor that is only expressed at low levels in unprimed HeLa and 143 tk- cells.

3335283|a|To describe the differentiation of the small bowel at the molecular level, intestinal messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) from mice at different stages of fetal and postnatal development were investigated. On the basis of cell-free translation and complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cloning experiments, abundant mRNAs coding for small polypeptides of 6-12 kilodaltons (low-molecular-weight mRNAs) were found in adult small intestine but not in the fetal gut. These developmentally regulated low-molecular-weight mRNAs are uniquely abundant in jejunum and ileum of adult mice, but they are absent or occur only at low levels in the duodenum, colon, stomach, and all other mouse organs examined. Low-molecular-weight mRNAs begin accumulating in the small bowel at approximately 3 wk of age, coinciding with weaning and with profound changes in intestinal differentiation. One complementary deoxyribonucleic acid clone of a low-molecular-weight mRNA (asb4/134) is specific to the distal small bowel, specifically accumulates at weaning, and hybridizes to RNA from mouse testis and brain at approximately 2%-5% of the intestinal level. Low-molecular-weight mRNA sequences may provide important markers of intestinal differentiation at the genetic level, leading to a better understanding of the factors that contribute to its postnatal maturation.

8405883|a|Exogenous antigenic peptides are presented to T cells by class II major histocompatibility complex (Ia) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Class II-associated invariant chain (Ii) is also required for effective antigen presentation. Because messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for Ii chain and for class II I-A beta chain appear in the mouse intestinal epithelium after weaning, experiments were conducted to test the effect of age of weaning and diet on the appearance of Ia and Ii mRNA.Four litters were split at day 17; one half was weaned and the other remained with the mother until day 24. On day 23, 25, 27, and 29, enterocytes were isolated from full-length small intestine by vascular perfusion with 30 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and the RNA was extracted.Appearance of Ii and I-A beta was significantly delayed by late weaning, as judged by RNA hybridization blots (Ii chain) and complementary DNA amplification (I-A beta chain). In mice on elemental diets, the appearance of Ii and I-A beta chain was delayed compared with littermates reared on standard chow. Ii mRNA failed to appear in mice maintained on the elemental diet by day 40, despite normal growth.Appearance of mRNA for both Ia and Ii depends on the introduction of a complex diet and not the "stress" of weaning or elimination of breast milk. Introduction of foreign dietary antigens or development of an altered intestinal flora may contribute to this process.

388439|a|A method has been devised for the electrophoretic transfer of proteins from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose sheets. The method results in quantitative transfer of ribosomal proteins from gels containing urea. For sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, the original band pattern was obtained with no loss of resolution, but the transfer was not quantitative. The method allows detection of proteins by autoradiography and is simpler than conventional procedures. The immobilized proteins were detectable by immunological procedures. All additional binding capacity on the nitrocellulose was blocked with excess protein; then a specific antibody was bound and, finally, a second antibody directed against the first antibody. The second antibody was either radioactively labeled or conjugated to fluorescein or to peroxidase. The specific protein was then detected by either autoradiography, under UV light, or by the peroxidase reaction product, respectively. In the latter case, as little as 100 pg of protein was clearly detectable. It is anticipated that the procedure will be applicable to analysis of a wide variety of proteins with specific reactions or ligands.

7694578|a|The actions of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are modulated by interaction with a family of secreted binding proteins (IGFBPs). We have now demonstrated in intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) that the secretion of different members of this family depends on the cell surface secreting them. Polarized monolayers of cells secreted IGFBP-3 mainly into the medium adjacent to the apical surface, while IGFBP-2 was secreted predominantly through the basolateral surface. The secretion of IGFBP-1 and -4 was equivalent from both surfaces. However, administration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced polarized secretion of IGFBP-4 by increasing secretion from the apical surface more than from the basolateral aspect. It did not affect the polarity of the other IGFBPs. We believe that this is the first evidence that epithelial cells can interact with extrinsic agents in a polarized fashion at sites other than the membrane surface.

The level of beta 1-AR and beta 2-AR mRNA followed a pattern of development which paralleled that for the receptor binding sites; the levels of mRNA and binding sites were low at day 1 and increased gradually to adult levels by postnatal days 16-25. In contrast, the level of G protein mRNA, including that for Gs alpha, Gi1 alpha, Gi2 alpha, Go alpha and G beta, on postnatal day 1 was equal to or greater than adult levels, increased 40-80% between day 1 and 7 and then decreased to adult values by day 14-25. This developmental time course approximates that reported for the expression of Gs and Gi but not Go and G beta protein levels determined by immunolabeling and toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. The level of beta-actin mRNA was also greater than adult levels on day 1 and then gradually decreased to adult levels by day 14-25.

2122968|a|Cyclic AMP is known to enhance retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells to parietal endoderm. Recently, we showed that a parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), by activating adenylate cyclase, can substitute for exogenous cAMP in promoting retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 cells. However, the mechanisms by which endogenous cAMP levels are regulated during F9 differentiation are poorly defined. We therefore assessed whether Gs alpha, a subunit of the stimulatory coupling protein of adenylate cyclase, is induced during this process. Treatment of F9 cells with retinoic acid (1 microM) for 5 days resulted in a 20-fold increase in steady-state levels of a 2.0-kilobase Gs alpha mRNA. This was accompanied by an increase in the expression of 52- and 45-kDa Gs alpha polypeptides. Gs alpha mRNA increases within 24 h of exposure to retinoic acid, whereas the expression of alpha 1 (IV) collagen, a marker for F9 differentiation, did not increase until 48 h of treatment. In the presence of retinoic acid, exogenous human PTHrP-(1-34)-amide (20 nM) produced a further 2-fold increase in Gs alpha mRNA. These effects of retinoic acid and PTHrP were exerted largely if not entirely at the level of Gs alpha gene transcription, as assessed by nuclear run-on assay. Bt2cAMP (1 mM) did not reproduce the stimulatory effects of PTHrP on Gs alpha transcription, mRNA, or protein. These data demonstrate that a marked increase in Gs alpha expression accompanies F9 differentiation induced by retinoic acid and PTHrP, and that the regulation is predominantly transcriptional. The resulting increase in adenylate cyclase responsiveness to PTHrP and perhaps other ligands may be a critical component of the differentiation process. The effect of PTHrP on the expression of Gs alpha appears to be mediated by signals other than cAMP.

1824633|a|We have previously reported that there is a global reduction in adenylyl cyclase associated with a decrement in Gs functional activity in cardiac sarcolemma from animals with pressure overload-induced hypertrophy and heart failure. This study was performed to determine whether hypertrophy alone in the absence of heart failure is sufficient to promote these changes and whether the superimposition of heart failure intensified these changes. Basal and stimulated adenylyl cyclase and Gs activity, as determined in the S49 cyc- reconstitution assay, were measured in sarcolemma from normal (NL), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and heart failure (HF) animals. Simultaneously, we measured the mRNA level encoding for the Gs alpha subunit. These studies indicate that Gs activity and Gs alpha mRNA are decreased by approximately 30% both in the failing heart and even in the heart with compensated hypertrophy before heart failure develops (Gs activity, pmol cyclic AMP/10 min per microgram, NL 4.2 +/- 0.4, LVH 3.0 +/- 0.2, HF 3.2 +/- 0.3; Gs alpha mRNA, pg/10 micrograms RNA, NL 131 +/- 9.0, LVH 104 +/- 7.4, HF 97.4 +/- 9.1; P less than 0.05 as compared with NL for LVH and HF). Accompanying this decrement in Gs activity is a fall in adenylyl cyclase, both basal and stimulated. However, we also identified a further decrease in adenylyl cyclase without any additional change in Gs or in its alpha subunit mRNA level. This is seen only in the sarcolemma from animals with heart failure as compared with those with compensated LV hypertrophy (e.g., NaF-stimulated activity, pmol cyclic AMP/min per mg, NL 420.2 +/- 17.5, LVH 347.1 +/- 29.6, HF 244.2 +/- 27.3; P less than 0.05 compared with NL for LVH and HF, P less than 0.05 compared with LVH for HF). In summary, these studies indicate that both Gs and adenylyl cyclase activities fall in parallel with the development of LV hypertrophy followed by a further decrement in adenylyl cyclase, independent of Gs, in the setting of heart failure.

2838757|a|One of the biochemical results of ethanol exposure is a change in the amount of the intracellular second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) produced in response to receptor stimulation. In general, acute ethanol exposure increases the amount of cAMP produced on stimulation of receptors coupled to the enzyme adenylyl cyclase via the GTP-binding protein Gs, whereas chronic ethanol exposure has the opposite effect (results for receptors coupled via Gi have been more variable). We previously reported that adaptation to continuous ethanol exposure reduces receptor-stimulated cAMP production by 25-35% in a neuroblastoma cell line (NG108-15), and an even greater reduction of 75% was observed in lymphocytes taken from actively-drinking alcoholics. This reduction in receptor-stimulated cAMP levels was recently confirmed in platelets from alcoholics. None of these studies, however, determined whether more than one receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase activity was affected in the same cell. Here we report that chronic ethanol exposure causes desensitization of heterologous receptors coupled to Gs as cAMP production mediated by prostaglandin E1 as well as by adenosine is reduced by approximately 30% in NG108-15 cells. We show that, after chronic ethanol exposure, the activity of the alpha subunit of Gs is decreased by 29%, the amount of alpha s protein is decreased by 38.5%, and alpha s messenger RNA is decreased by 30%. Thus, cellular adaptation to ethanol involves a reduction in alpha s mRNA and, as a consequence, reduced cAMP production by heterologous receptors coupled to Gs. Such changes in cAMP production may account for the tolerance and physical dependence on ethanol in alcoholism.

2824182|a|Changes in the functional and biochemical characteristics of membrane receptors for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were evaluated in vitro, using epithelial intestinal cells isolated during rat development, from day 17 of gestation to adulthood. These characteristics included cell cAMP generation, adenylate cyclase and cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase cAMP-PDE activities, [125I]VIP-binding capacity, and the molecular components of [125I]VIP-binding sites. In 19-day-old fetuses, VIP induced a significant and persistent increase in cAMP production, which lasted for 10 min in intestinal cells. This effect, measured at 37 C in the absence of cAMP-PDE inhibitor, only lasted for 3 min in 5-day-old rats and was undetectable in adult intestine. Addition of the cAMP-PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine with VIP caused, potentiated, and maintained elevated cAMP levels at the three stages considered. Intestinal cells were more sensitive to VIP in 17- and 19-day-old fetuses (ED50 = 5 and 17 X 10(-11) M VIP, respectively, at 15 and 37 C) than in adult rats (EC50 = 2.7 and 1.6 X 10(-9) M VIP). Adenylate cyclase activity rose 4-fold in fetal intestine and had an apparent Ka of 4 X 10(-10) M VIP. These changes in VIP receptor activity were not observed for PGE2 receptors in developing rat intestinal cells or in the VIP-sensitive adenylate cyclase system prepared from liver of fetuses and adults. They might be due to differences between the molecular components of the intestinal VIP receptor, which were identified here as autoradiographic bands of 64,800 daltons in 19-day-old rat fetuses and 74,600 daltons in adults (P less than 0.01). Alternatively, the changes in VIP receptor activity in 5-day-old rats may result from decreases in the number and affinity of the [125I]VIP-binding sites and increases in the velocity of cAMP-PDE activity. The release of VIP from intestinal nerve endings during fetal and postnatal development and the absorption of VIP from milk might, therefore, modulate the intestinal VIP receptor and its effector systems. Because specific VIP receptors were expressed before the morphological and functional differentiation of intestinal and liver cells, we conclude that their activity is an indicator of their development, and suggest that in rats, this neuropeptide may regulate the maturation and functions of intestine and liver during fetal life.

3118356|a|Cholera toxin alters intestinal function by stimulation of adenylyl cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing) or adenylate cyclase, EC 4.6.1.1]. The mechanism of this activation is unknown and particularly puzzling because adenylyl cyclase is confined to the basal lateral membrane of enterocytes, whereas it is the brush border membrane that binds the toxin and contains proteins that undergo cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation. It is shown that cholate extracts from cholera toxin-treated brush border membranes can efficiently reconstitute adenylyl cyclase activity in the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component (Gs)-deficient cyc- variant of the S49 mouse lymphoma cell line (cyc- cells lack the alpha subunit of Gs needed to activate the catalytic subunit of adenylyl cyclase). Moreover, NaF (in the presence of Al3+) and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate mediate strong activation of cyc- adenylyl cyclase provided the cholate extracts of brush border membranes are also present. Therefore, it appears that brush border membranes contain high levels of regulatory subunits of adenylyl cyclase in the absence of catalytic subunits. This represents a previously unrecognized feature of this transduction system that presumably plays an important role in the derangement of intestinal cell function by cholera toxin.

7709430|a|The intracellular signalling field is dominated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and its control, which involves the small GTPase Ras and sequential kinase activation. Until recently, ERK1 and ERK2 were the only cloned and well-characterized mammalian MAPKs; diverse ligand-stimulated, proline-directed protein phosphorylation events were attributed to these kinases. The recent discovery of two other MAPK subtypes, the JNK/SAPK subfamily and p38/RK (mammalian equivalents of HOG1 in yeast), reveals extreme complexity within the family and, most intriguingly, the existence in mammalian cells of parallel MAPK cascades that can be activated simultaneously.

These activation events include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, 70 kDa S6 kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase C-gamma, and the Jak/STAT pathways. The precise role of each of these pathways in cell signaling remains to be resolved, but studies on the differentiation of mammalian PC12 cells in tissue culture and the genetics of cell fate determination in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis suggest that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK-regulated) MAPK pathway may be sufficient for these cellular responses. Experiments with PC12 cells also suggest that the duration of ERK activation is critical for cell signaling decisions.

8177321|a|The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases Erk-1 and Erk-2 are proline-directed kinases that are themselves activated through concomitant phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues. The kinase p54 (M(r) 54,000), which was first isolated from cycloheximide-treated rats, is proline-directed like Erks-1/2, and requires both Tyr and Ser/Thr phosphorylation for activity. p54 is, however, distinct from Erks-1/2 in its substrate specificity, being unable to phosphorylate pp90rsk but more active in phosphorylating the c-Jun transactivation domain. Molecular cloning of p54 reveals a unique subfamily of extracellularly regulated kinases. Although they are 40-45% identical in sequence to Erks-1/2, unlike Erks-1/2 the p54s are only poorly activated in most cells by mitogens or phorbol esters. However, p54s are the principal c-Jun N-terminal kinases activated by cellular stress and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, hence they are designated stress-activated protein kinases, or SAPKs. SAPKs are also activated by sphingomyelinase, which elicits a subset of cellular responses to TNF-alpha (ref. 9). SAPKs therefore define a new TNF-alpha and stress-activated signalling pathway, possibly initiated by sphingomyelin-based second messengers, which regulates the activity of c-Jun.

The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.

7935387|a|c-Jun transcriptional activity is stimulated by phosphorylation at two N-terminal sites: Ser-63 and -73. Phosphorylation of these sites is enhanced in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and UV irradiation. New members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase group of signal-transducing enzymes, termed JNKs, bind to the activation domain of c-Jun and specifically phosphorylate these sites. However, the N-terminal sites of c-Jun were also suggested to be phosphorylated by two other MAP kinases, ERK1 and ERK2. Despite these reports, we find that unlike the JNKs, ERK1 and ERK2 do not phosphorylate the N-terminal sites of c-Jun in vitro; instead they phosphorylate an inhibitory C-terminal site. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-Jun in vivo at the N-terminal sites correlates with activation of the JNKs but not the ERKs. The ERKs are probably involved in the induction of c-fos expression and thereby contribute to the stimulation of AP-1 activity. Our study suggests that two different branches of the MAP kinase group are involved in the stimulation of AP-1 activity through two different mechanisms.

7535770|a|Protein kinases activated by dual phosphorylation on Tyr and Thr (MAP kinases) can be grouped into two major classes: ERK and JNK. The ERK group regulates multiple targets in response to growth factors via a Ras-dependent mechanism. In contrast, JNK activates the transcription factor c-Jun in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines and exposure of cells to several forms of environmental stress. Recently, a novel mammalian protein kinase (p38) that shares sequence similarity with mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases was identified. Here, we demonstrate that p38, like JNK, is activated by treatment of cells with pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress. The mechanism of p38 activation is mediated by dual phosphorylation on Thr-180 and Tyr-182. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that p38 MAP kinase is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of activated cells. Together, these data establish that p38 is a member of the mammalian MAP kinase group.

This confirms the hypothesis that kinases other than protein kinases A and C may be involved in the TNF signal transduction. Chromatography on Mono Q resolved multiple kinase peaks with each substrate tested and moreover revealed a TNF-mediated casein kinase-2 activation in both cell lines, measurable with the specific RRREEESEEE peptide or with the G peptide.

7689564|a|Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine whose many demonstrated actions include effects on cell growth and differentiation. TNF treatment of cells is known to lead to a rapid increase in serine/threonine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins, but the kinases responsible remain largely unidentified. We show that TNF treatment induces a rapid and transient increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity in the human diploid FS-4 cell line, for which TNF is known to be mitogenic. TNF-induced activation of MAPK was demonstrated by its enhanced ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein in vitro and by a characteristic shift in the electrophoretic mobility of MAPK proteins. MAPK activation was accompanied by a significant increase of MAPK phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which was demonstrated by 32P labeling of cells and isolation of the labeled proteins after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, and by direct immunoblotting of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-fractionated unlabeled cell lysates with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. The pp42 and pp44 MAPK were the only proteins whose tyrosine phosphorylation was demonstrably increased in FS-4 cells after TNF treatment. MAPK activation is likely to represent an important component in the cascade of signals that link TNF receptors to various TNF-elicited cellular responses.

7686898|a|Mechanisms involved in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha signal transduction are incompletely understood. In some circumstances, TNF may use a signal transduction pathway involving hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide and stimulation of a ceramide-activated protein kinase. In HL-60 cells, TNF rapidly activates this pathway and induces monocytic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that treatment of HL-60 cells with TNF selectively increases tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42mapk) and stimulates its enzymatic activity. Induction of p42mapk phosphorylation was time- and dose-dependent and closely paralleled activation of sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Direct engagement of the sphingomyelin signal transduction pathway by addition of bacterial sphingomyelinase led to MAP kinase activation. The time course of p42mapk phosphorylation in the sphingomyelinase-treated cells was similar to that of TNF, with maximal response occurring at 5 min. A maximal concentration of sphingomyelinase (0.01 unit/ml) was more potent than TNF at inducing MAP kinase enzymatic activity (2.6-fold) and phosphorylation of MAP kinase and tyrosine. The cell-permeable ceramide analogs, C2- and C6-ceramide, which mimic effects of TNF, also induced p42mapk phosphorylation within seconds. These studies indicate that the sphingomyelin pathway can regulate MAP kinase activity and suggest that MAP kinase activation by this mechanism may be involved in TNF-induced signal transduction.

8617238|a|Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine, the activities of which include effects on gene expression, cell growth and cell death. The biological signalling mechanisms which are responsible for these TNF effects remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the stress-responsive p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is involved in TNF-induced cytokine expression. TNF Treatment of cell activated the p38 MAP kinase pathway, as revealed by increased phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase itself, activation of the substrate protein MAPKAP kinase-2, and culminating in the phosphorylation of the heat shock protein 27 (hsp27). Pretreatment of cells with the highly specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 completely blocked this TNF-induced activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 and hsp27 phosphorylation. Under the same conditions, SB203580 also completely inhibited TNF-induced synthesis of interleukin (IL)-6 and expression of a reporter gene that was driven by a minimal promoter containing two NF-Kappa B elements. However, neither TNF-induced DNA binding of TNF-Kappa B nor TNF-induced phosphorylation of its subunits was modulated by SB203580, suggesting that NF-Kappa B is not a direct target for the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Interestingly, TNF-induced cytotoxicity was not affected by SB203580, indicating that p38 MAP kinase might be an interesting target to interfere selectively with TNF-induced gene activation.

It is not known whether it plays a role in the stimulation of other forms of stress-induced apoptosis. Given that environmental stresses also stimulate a stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK), the sphingomyelin and SAPK/JNK signalling systems may be coordinated in induction of apoptosis.

To characterize molecular mechanisms that regulate neuronal apoptosis, the contributions to cell death of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family members, including ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase), and p38, were examined after withdrawal of nerve growth factor (NGF) from rat PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. NGF withdrawal led to sustained activation of the JNK and p38 enzymes and inhibition of ERKs. The effects of dominant-interfering or constitutively activated forms of various components of the JNK-p38 and ERK signaling pathways demonstrated that activation of JNK and p38 and concurrent inhibition of ERK are critical for induction of apoptosis in these cells. Therefore, the dynamic balance between growth factor-activated ERK and stress-activated JNK-p38 pathways may be important in determining whether a cell survives or undergoes apoptosis.

This inhibition prevented the degradation of the NF-kappa B inhibitor, I kappa B, and therefore NF-kappa B was retained in the cytosol.

This induction of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 requires the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). Recent work has suggested that some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including sodium salicylate and aspirin, can inhibit NF-kappa B-dependent gene activation. We studied the effects of salicylates on expression of adhesion molecules in HUVECs. We found that sodium salicylate inhibited activation of NF-kappa B (p50/p65 and p65/p65) by preventing phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the inhibitor 1 kappa B-alpha. Salicylate treatment had no effect on TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF-2. Salicylate blocked the TNF-alpha-induced increase in mRNA levels of adhesion molecules and gave a dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced surface expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 with higher doses required to inhibit endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 expression. Indomethacin, a nonsalicylate cyclooxygenase inhibitor, had no effect on surface expression of adhesion molecules, suggesting that the effects were not due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase. Treatment of endothelial cell monolayers with sodium salicylate inhibited transendothelial migration of neutrophils but had no significant effect on neutrophil adhesion under flow conditions. The clinical importance of high-dose salicylates in inflammation may be due, in part, to the ability to prevent expression of inducible adhesion molecules and recruitment of leukocytes.

8626494|a|Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activates both p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in human FS-4 fibroblasts, cells for which TNF is mitogenic. We now show that TNF activates p42 MAPK in two cell lines whose growth is inhibited by TNF. A mutant TNF that binds only to the p55 TNF receptor (TNFR) produced a similar degree of activation as wild-type TNF in FS-4 fibroblasts, indicating that the p55 TNFR is sufficient to mediate p42/p44 MAPK activation. The upstream intracellular signals that couple the TNFR to MAPK activation are still poorly defined. We now show that neither phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C nor Gialpha link TNF to p42/p44 MAPK activation, because pretreatment of FS-4 cells with phorbol ester to down-regulate protein kinase C or pretreatment with pertussis toxin to block Gialpha does not inhibit p42/p44 MAPK activation by TNF. To further analyze MAPK activation in FS-4 cells, we compared p42/p44 MAPK activation by TNF and epidermal growth factor (EGF). While tyrosine phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK was detected almost immediately (30 s) after stimulating cells with EGF, TNF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was detected only after a more prolonged time interval (initially detected at 5 min and peaking at 15-30 min). In addition, the anti-inflammatory drug sodium salicylate, previously demonstrated to inhibit NF- kappaB activation by TNF, blocked the activation of p42/p44 MAPK in response to TNF but not in response to EGF. These findings demonstrate that the TNF and EGF receptors utilize distinct signaling molecules to couple to MAPK activation. Elucidation of the mechanism whereby sodium salicylate blocks TNF-induced p42/p44 MAPK activation may help to clarify TNF-activated signaling pathways.

Administration of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug sulindac has been followed by regression of polyps in patients with this disorder, but no controlled trial of this drug in patients who have not had surgery has been reported.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 22 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, including 18 who had not undergone colectomy. The patients received sulindac at a dose of 150 mg orally twice a day for nine months or identical-appearing placebo tablets. The number and size of the polyps were evaluated every three months for one year.A statistically significant decrease in the mean number of polyps and their mean diameter occurred in patients treated with sulindac, as compared with those given placebo. When treatment was stopped at nine months, the number of polyps had decreased to 44 percent of base-line values and the diameter of the polyps to 35 percent of base-line values (P = 0.014 and P < 0.001, respectively, for the comparison with the changes in the group given placebo). No patient had complete resolution of polyps. Three months after treatment with sulindac was stopped, both the number and the size of the polyps increased in sulindac-treated patients but remained significantly lower than the values at base line. No side effects from sulindac were noted.Sulindac reduces the number and size of colorectal adenomas in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, but its effect is incomplete, and it is unlikely to replace colectomy as primary therapy.

7637720|a|Most data suggest that the regular use of aspirin reduces the risk of colorectal cancer, but some apparently conflicting evidence exists. The effects of the dose and the duration of aspirin consumption on the risk of colorectal cancer are not well understood.We determined rates of colorectal cancer according to the number of consecutive years of regular aspirin use (defined as two or more tablets per week) among women in the Nurses' Health Study who reported regular aspirin use on three consecutive questionnaires (1980, 1982, and 1984) and compared the rates in this group with the rates among women who said they did not use aspirin. Cases of cancer occurring from 1984 through 1992 (the eight years after the 1984 questionnaire) were included.From 1984 through 1992, we documented 331 new cases of colorectal cancer during 551,651 person-years of follow-up. Women who consistently took two or more aspirin tablets per week had no appreciable reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer as compared with nonusers after four years (relative risk, 1.06; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.45) or after five to nine years (relative risk, 0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.55 to 1.28). There was a slight reduction in risk among women who took aspirin for 10 to 19 years, but it was not statistically significant (relative risk, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 1.20). However, there was a statistically significant reduction after 20 years of consistent use of aspirin (relative risk, 0.56; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.90; P for trend = 0.008). The maximal reduction in risk was observed among women who took four to six tablets per week; higher doses had a similar apparent benefit. Controlling for risk factors for colorectal cancer, including diet, did not change the results, and the earlier diagnosis and removal of colorectal adenomas among aspirin users did not account for the results.Regular aspirin use, at doses similar to those recommended for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, substantially reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. However, this benefit may not be evident until after at least a decade of regular aspirin consumption.

7657130|a|The mechanism by which sulindac causes regression of adenomas in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is unclear. Conflicting data on the drug's effects on colorectal epithelial proliferation have been reported. An alternative mechanism, and one not previously studied, is via induction of colorectal epithelial cell apoptosis (programmed cell death). This hypothesis was tested by studying the effects of sulindac on colorectal epithelial proliferation and apoptosis in patients with FAP.Cell proliferation was studied via immunohistochemistry for cell nuclear antigen in a group of 22 patients randomized to either sulindac (150 mg twice a day) or placebo in a previously published trial. The rectal epithelium from 7 additional patients with FAP treated with sulindac was examined by flow cytometry to assess changes in cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis.Although sulindac caused a significant decrease in polyp size and number, there was no significant change in cytokinetic variables or cell cycle distribution 3 months after treatment. However, the subdiploid apoptotic fraction was increased significantly 3 months after treatment with sulindac (31.3% +/- 4.8% compared with 10% +/- 4.3% at baseline; P = 0.01).Our findings suggest that sulindac does not affect colorectal epithelial proliferation and that its effects in patients with FAP may instead result from induction of apoptosis.

3512757|a|Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a monocyte-derived protein cytotoxic or cytostatic for some tumor cell lines. Here we show that highly purified E. coli-derived recombinant human TNF stimulated the growth of human FS-4 diploid fibroblasts. Stimulation of cell growth was demonstrable at a TNF concentration of 10 pg/ml (3 X 10(-13) M). Maximal stimulation was attained at TNF concentrations of 10 ng/ml (3 X 10(-10) M) or higher. Growth-stimulatory activity of TNF was inhibited by an mAb neutralizing the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Growth stimulation was not inhibited by another mAb specific for TNF, lacking neutralizing activity for the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Growth stimulation by TNF was more marked and more sustained in the presence of greater than or equal to 10% FCS than in medium with less than or equal to 5% FCS. Addition of TNF to confluent FS-4 cultures also produced a marked stimulation of cell growth in the presence of fresh FCS, while a much less marked stimulation was seen in the absence of FCS. Stimulation of confluent cultures by TNF in serum-free medium was enhanced by insulin, suggesting that insulin or insulin-like growth factor(s) in the serum can act synergistically with TNF in producing growth stimulation. While the growth-stimulatory effects of TNF and insulin were synergistic, the actions of TNF and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were less than additive, suggesting that TNF and EGF may activate identical or similar pathways. We conclude that stimulation of cell growth is probably a physiological function of TNF, and that the cytotoxic and cytostatic actions of TNF may be the result of an anomalous growth signal transduction in neoplastic cells lacking the constraints of normal growth control mechanisms.

8224842|a|The activity of c-Jun is regulated by phosphorylation. Various stimuli including transforming oncogenes and UV light, induce phosphorylation of serines 63 and 73 in the amino-terminal activation domain of c-Jun and thereby potentiate its trans-activation function. We identified a serine/threonine kinase whose activity is stimulated by the same signals that stimulate the amino-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun. This novel c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), whose major form is 46 kD, binds to a specific region within the c-Jun trans-activation domain and phosphorylates serines 63 and 73. Phosphorylation results in dissociation of the c-Jun-JNK complex. Mutations that disrupt the kinase-binding site attenuate the response of c-Jun to Ha-Ras and UV. Therefore the binding of JNK to c-Jun is of regulatory importance and suggests a mechanism through which protein kinase cascades can specifically modulate the activity of distinct nuclear targets.

3497923|a|Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) were shown previously to be mitogenic for human fibroblasts. Here we show that recombinant human TNF and recombinant human IL-1 alpha increase steady state levels of c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogene mRNAs in quiescent human FS-4 fibroblasts. Proto-oncogene mRNA levels were enhanced within 20 min of TNF or IL-1 addition, peaked at 30 min, and declined to undetectable levels (c-fos) or basal levels (c-myc) by 60 or 90 min. A similar rapid increase in c-fos and c-myc mRNA was seen in quiescent FS-4 cells exposed to cycloheximide. However, in the presence of cycloheximide, both proto-oncogene mRNA levels continued to rise for at least 90 min. The transient nature of the increase in c-myc mRNA levels appears to be a response characteristic for TNF and IL-1 because in quiescent FS-4 cells exposed to 10% fetal bovine serum, steady state levels of c-myc mRNA remained elevated for at least 4 h.

8063804|a|Matrix metalloproteinases are secreted enzymes important in inflammation and tumor invasion. Earlier, we demonstrated that in normal human FS-4 fibroblasts, collagenase and stromelysin mRNA levels are increased not only after treatment with known matrix metalloproteinase inducers such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, but also with interferon-beta (IFN-beta). In this study, we compared the regulation of these matrix metalloproteinase genes by TNF and IFN-beta. We show that both TNF and IFN-beta increase steady-state levels of collagenase and stromelysin mRNAs with similar slow kinetics. The glucocorticoid dexamethasone blocked matrix metalloproteinase induction by both cytokines. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide inhibited collagenase mRNA induction by TNF or IFN-beta, suggesting that induction by both agents is indirect. Consistent with these observations, both TNF and IFN-beta increased c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels. Furthermore, treatment with TNF or IFN-beta increased the transcriptional activity of activator protein-1-responsive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs, including a native collagenase promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct. These findings show that regulation of matrix metalloproteinase gene expression by both TNF and IFN-beta involves the transcription factor activator protein-1 and demonstrate a novel indirect mechanism of type I IFN-induced gene expression.

8603987|a|A new member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, alternatively termed CSBP, p38, or RK, has been identified independently by several laboratories recently. Activation of this novel protein kinase via dual phosphorylation has been observed in different cell systems upon stimulation by a wide spectrum of stimuli, such as physicochemical stress and treatment with lipopolysaccharide or proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor. Furthermore, CSAID cytokine biosynthesis inhibitors have now been determined to be potent and selective inhibitors of CSBP/p38/RK kinase activity. These inhibitors will help to dissect signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses. In particular, for the first time a definitive signal transduction pathway can be prescribed to the action of lipopolysaccharide in cytokine production in macrophages.

7750577|a|A class of pyridinyl imidazoles inhibit the MAP kinase homologue, termed here reactivating kinase (RK) [Lee et al. (1994) Nature 372, 739-746]. We now show that one of these compounds (SB 203580) inhibits RK in vitro (IC50 = 0.6 microM), suppresses the activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 and prevents the phosphorylation of heat shock protein (HSP) 27 in response to interleukin-1, cellular stresses and bacterial endotoxin in vivo. These results establish that MAPKAP kinase-2 is a physiological RK substrate, and that HSP27 is phosphorylated by MAPKAP kinase-2 in vivo. The specificity of SB 203580 was indicated by its failure to inhibit 12 other protein kinases in vitro, and by its lack of effect on the activation of RK kinase and other MAP kinase cascades in vivo. We suggest that SB 203580 will be useful for identifying other physiological roles and targets of RK and MAPKAP kinase-2.

7583362|a|Expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) by lipopolysaccharide-treated human monocytic cells is inhibited by bicyclic imidazoles. We studied the mechanism of action of a representative inhibitor, SK&F 86002, on synthesis of TNF by THP-1 cells. Levels of TNF protein were lowered by SK&F 86002 under conditions where TNF mRNA accumulation was unaffected, suggesting a post-transcriptional action. No effect of SK&F 86002 was detected on the rate of induction of TNF mRNA or steady state levels over a 5 hr period. The kinetics of SK&F 86002 inhibition of TNF protein synthesis coincided with those of anisomycin, not with actinomycin, suggesting an effect of SK&F 86002 on TNF mRNA translation. By using sucrose gradient sedimentation, we showed that quiescent THP-1 cells contained a substantial amount of TNF mRNA which was primarily associated with 43S pre-ribosomal complexes. Activation of the cells with lipopolysaccharide caused an elevation of the TNF mRNA level and increased the proportion associated with polyribosomes. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide plus SK&F 86002 led to a marked accumulation of TNF mRNA in the 43S complex-containing fractions and a concomitant reduction of polysome-associated TNF message. Neither lipopolysaccharide nor SK&F 86002 affected the amount or distribution of cyclophilin mRNA in the same fractions. The results suggest that lipopolysaccharide activates TNF translation at the initiation step and that SK&F 86002 inhibits this activation.

8630372|a|To understand the role of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) in disease, investigators have studied how production of the different members of the IL-1 family is controlled, the various biologic activities of IL-1, the distinct and various functions of the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) family, and the complexity of intracellular signaling. Mice deficient in IL-1Beta, IL-1Beta converting enzyme, and IL-1R type I have also been studied. Humans have been injected with IL-1 (either IL-1alpha or IL-1beta) for enhancing bone marrow recovery and for cancer treatment. The IL-1-specific receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) has also been tested in clinical trials. The topics discussed in this review include production and activities of IL-1 and IL-1Ra molecules, the effects of IL-1 on gene expression, functions of cell-bound and soluble IL-1 receptors, the importance of the IL-1R accessory protein, newly discovered signal transduction pathways, naturally occurring cytokines limiting IL-1 production or activity, the effects of blocking cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide, and the outcomes of IL-1 and IL-1 Ra in human trials. Special attention is paid to IL-1beta converting enzyme and programmed cell death. The roles of IL-1 in hematopoiesis, leukemia, atherosclerosis, and growth of solid tumors are also discussed. This is a lengthy review, with 586 citations chosen to illustrate specific areas of interest rather than a compendium of references. At the end of each section, a short commentary summarizes what the author considers established or controversial topics linking the biology of IL-1 to mechanisms of disease.

1322499|a|Transcription of the proto-oncogene c-fos is stimulated rapidly and transiently by serum growth factors and mitogens. Critical for this response is the serum-response element which is bound in vivo in a ternary complex containing the transcription factors p67SRF and p62TCF (ref. 2). Disruption of the ternary complex correlates with impaired induction by serum and phorbol ester. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is a serine/threonine kinase which is activated 1-5 minutes after treatment of cells with mitogens and growth factors that induce re-entry into the cell cycle, making MAP kinase a candidate for the transmission of proliferative signals. Here we show that p62TCF is phosphorylated by MAP kinase in vitro and that phosphorylation results in enhanced ternary complex formation. Serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells treated with epidermal growth factor, which induces MAP kinase in these cells, are induced to express c-fos and yield p62TCF active in ternary complex formation. In contrast, treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin, which does not activate MAP kinase under these conditions, does not lead to enhanced ternary complex formation nor does it induce c-fos transcription. Our results link the expression of the human c-fos proto-oncogene to signal transduction pathways known to be activated before its own induction.

8386592|a|The Elk-1 and SRF transcription factors form a ternary complex at the c-fos serum response element (SRE). Growth factor stimulation rapidly induces a reversible change in the electrophoretic mobility of the ternary complex, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of the Elk-1 C-terminal region and by the activation of a 42 kd cellular Elk-1 kinase. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 in vitro by partially purified p42/p44 MAP kinase induces a similar reduction in ternary complex mobility but has little effect on the efficiency of its formation. In vitro, MAP kinase phosphorylates the Elk-1 C-terminal region at multiple sites, which are also phosphorylated following growth factor stimulation in vivo. The Elk-1 C-terminal region functions as a regulated transcriptional activation domain whose activity in vivo is dependent on the integrity of the MAP kinase sites. These findings directly link transcriptional activation by the SRE to the growth factor-regulated phosphorylation of an SRE-binding protein.

7651411|a|Inhibitors of protein synthesis, such as anisomycin and cycloheximide, lead to superinduction of immediate-early genes. We demonstrate that these two drugs activate intracellular signaling pathways involving both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) cascades. The activation of either pathway correlates with phosphorylation of the c-fos regulatory transcription factor Elk-1. In HeLa cells, anisomycin stabilizes c-fos mRNA when protein synthesis is inhibited to only 50%. Under these conditions, anisomycin, in contrast to cycloheximide, rapidly induces kinase activation and efficient Elk-1 phosphorylation. However, full inhibition of translation by either drug leads to prolonged activation of SAPK activity, while MAPK induction is transient. This correlates with prolonged Elk-1 phosphorylation and c-fos transcription. Elk-1 induction and c-fos activation are also observed in KB cells, in which anisomycin strongly induces SAPKs but not MAPKs. Purified p54 SAPK alpha efficiently phosphorylates the Elk-1 C-terminal domain in vitro and comigrates with anisomycin-activated kinases in in-gel kinase assays. Thus, Elk-1 provides a potential convergence point for the MAPK and SAPK signaling pathways. The activation of signal cascades and control of transcription factor function therefore represent prominent processes in immediate-early gene superinduction.

8943018|a|Despite intensive efforts, the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate apoptosis remain unclear. The human B lymphoma cell line, B104, possesses characteristics that make it an attractive model for analysis of receptor-mediated apoptosis. Although these cells express both membrane IgM (mIgM) and membrane IgD (mIgD) crosslinking mIgM results in significant apoptosis while crosslinking mIgD does not. Our results show that crosslinking mIgM but not mIgD induced a delayed and sustained activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and p38 MAPK. The calcium ionophore ionomycin, which also induces apoptosis in B104 cells, stimulated a similar SAPK and p38 MAPK response. Cyclosporin A, a potent inhibitor of apoptosis induced by either mIgM or ionomycin, inhibited activation of both SAPK and p38 MAPK, suggesting that stimulation of these kinases may be required for induction of apoptosis. Collectively, our results indicate that SAPK and p38 MAPK may be downstream targets during mIgM-induced, calcium-mediated, apoptosis in human B lymphocytes.

8940070|a|The human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) promoter is known to be activated by proinflammatory cytokines and UV light. These stimuli also activate various members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, including JNK/SAPK and CSBP/p38. In HeLa cells containing an integrated HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) -driven reporter, we now show that the specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580, inhibits activation of the HIV-1 LTR by interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, UV light, and osmotic stress. Inhibition was 70-90% in all but the case of tumor necrosis factor stimulation, where inhibition was 50%. Each of these stimuli activated p38, which was inhibited by SB203580 in vitro and in vivo with an IC50 (between 0.1 and 1 microM) similar to that required to inhibit transcription. In contrast, SB203580 had no effect on JNK, which was also activated by these stimuli. The NFkappaB sites in the HIV-1 LTR were required for a response to cytokines but not to UV, and SB203580 remained capable of inhibiting UV activation in the absence of the NFkappaB sites. Studies in which SB203580 was added at different times relative to UV stimulation suggested that the critical p38-mediated phosphorylation event occurred between 2 and 4 h after UV treatment. These data indicate that p38 is required for HIV-1 LTR activation but that the action of p38 is delayed, presumably due to substrate unavailability or inaccessibility.

1400587|a|Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a key role in developmental biology and in maintenance of the steady state in continuously renewing tissues. Currently, its existence is inferred mainly from gel electrophoresis of a pooled DNA extract as PCD was shown to be associated with DNA fragmentation. Based on this observation, we describe here the development of a method for the in situ visualization of PCD at the single-cell level, while preserving tissue architecture. Conventional histological sections, pretreated with protease, were nick end labeled with biotinylated poly dU, introduced by terminal deoxy-transferase, and then stained using avidin-conjugated peroxidase. The reaction is specific, only nuclei located at positions where PCD is expected are stained. The initial screening includes: small and large intestine, epidermis, lymphoid tissues, ovary, and other organs. A detailed analysis revealed that the process is initiated at the nuclear periphery, it is relatively short (1-3 h from initiation to cell elimination) and that PCD appears in tissues in clusters. The extent of tissue-PCD revealed by this method is considerably greater than apoptosis detected by nuclear morphology, and thus opens the way for a variety of studies.

This suggested that TNF induced some protective mechanism(s) and that protein synthesis was required for this induction. By labeling fibroblasts with [35S]methionine, we observed that TNF induced in these cells the synthesis of two proteins of Mr 36,000 and 42,000 (p36 and p42). This induction was dependent on the TNF concentration and was observed within a few hours after addition of TNF. Actinomycin D prevented synthesis of these proteins, suggesting that TNF induced transcription of the corresponding mRNAs. p42 appeared to be stable, whereas p36 turned over within a few hours. The physiological role of these proteins in the cellular response to TNF remains to be established.

8654373|a|The JNK protein kinase is a member of the MAP kinase group that is activated in response to dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine. Ten JNK isoforms were identified in human brain by molecular cloning. These protein kinases correspond to alternatively spliced isoforms derived from the JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 genes. The protein kinase activity of these JNK isoforms was measured using the transcription factors ATF2, Elk-1 and members of the Jun family as substrates. Treatment of cells with interleukin-1 (IL-1) caused activation of the JNK isoforms. This activation was blocked by expression of the MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-1. Comparison of the binding activity of the JNK isoforms demonstrated that the JNK proteins differ in their interaction with ATF2, Elk-1 and Jun transcription factors. Individual members of the JNK group may therefore selectively target specific transcription factors in vivo.

These MAP kinase isoforms are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine. Two human MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK4) were cloned that phosphorylate and activate p38 MAP kinase. These MKK isoforms did not activate the ERK subgroup of MAP kinases, but MKK4 did activate JNK. These data demonstrate that the activators of p38 (MKK3 and MKK4), JNK (MKK4), and ERK (MEK1 and MEK2) define independent MAP kinase signal transduction pathways.

The detection of p38 MAP kinase in the nucleus of activated cells suggests that p38 MAP kinase can mediate signaling to the nucleus. To test this hypothesis, we constructed expression vectors for activated MKK3 and MKK6, two MAP kinase kinases that phosphorylate and activate p38 MAP kinase. Expression of activated MKK3 and MKK6 in cultured cells caused a selective increase in p38 MAP kinase activity. Cotransfection experiments demonstrated that p38 MAP kinase activation causes increased reporter gene expression mediated by the transcription factors ATF2 and Elk-1.

8552595|a|The function of the recently discovered angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor remains elusive. This receptor is expressed abundantly in fetus, but scantily in adult tissues except brain, adrenal medulla, and atretic ovary. In this study, we demonstrated that this receptor mediates programmed cell death (apoptosis). We observed this effect in PC12W cells (rat pheochromocytoma cell line) and R3T3 cells (mouse fibroblast cell line), which express abundant AT2 receptor but not AT1 receptor. The cellular mechanism appears to involve the dephosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase). Vanadate, a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase inhibitor, attenuated the dephosphorylation of MAP kinases by the AT2 receptor and restored the apoptotic changes. Antisense oligonucleotide to MAP kinase phosphatase 1 inhibited the AT2 receptor-mediated MAP kinase dephosphorylation and blocked the AT2 receptor-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, including MAP kinase phosphatase 1 activated by the AT2 receptor, is involved in apoptosis. We hypothesize that this apoptotic function of the AT2 receptor may play an important role in developmental biology and pathophysiology.

Inhibition by genistein of a subset of IL-3/GM-CSF-mediated signals, including c-myc induction, resulted in the abrogation of DNA synthesis, however, IL-3 still protected cells from apoptotic cell death. Conversely, a C-terminal truncated form of the GM-CSF receptor, which is missing a critical cytoplasmic region required for activation of the Ras/Raf-1/MAP kinase pathway, induced DNA synthesis, but failed to prevent cell death in response to GM-CSF. Consequently, cells died by apoptosis in the presence of GM-CSF, despite displaying a transient mitogenic response. However, expression of activated Ras protein complemented defective signalling through the mutant receptor and supported long-term proliferation in concert with GM-CSF. These results indicate that IL-3 and GM-CSF prevent apoptosis of hematopoietic cells by activating a signalling pathway distinct from the induction of DNA synthesis and that long-term cell proliferation requires the activation of both pathways.

In particular, the RelA (p65) subunit is required for induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-dependent genes. Treatment of RelA-deficient (RelA-/-) mouse fibroblasts and macrophages with TNF-alpha resulted in a significant reduction in viability, whereas RelA+/+ cells were unaffected. Cytotoxicity to both cell types was mediated by TNF receptor 1. Reintroduction of RelA into RelA-/- fibroblasts resulted in enhanced survival, demonstrating that the presence of RelA is required for protection from TNF-alpha. These results have implications for the treatment of inflammatory and proliferative diseases.

8898208|a|Through its type 1 receptor (TNFR1), the cytokine TNF elicits an unusually wide range of biological responses, including inflammation, tumor necrosis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We investigated how TNFR1 activates different effector functions; the protein kinase JNK, transcription factor NF-kappaB, and apoptosis. We found that the three responses are mediated through separate pathways. Recruitment of the signal transducer FADD to the TNFR1 complex mediates apoptosis but not NF-kappaB or JNK activation. Two other signal transducers, RIP and TRAF2, mediate both JNK and NF-kappaB activation. These two responses, however, diverge downstream to TRAF2. Most importantly, JNK activation is not involved in induction of apoptosis, while activation of NF-kappaB protects against TNF-induced apoptosis.

Inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation enhanced apoptotic killing by these reagents but not by apoptotic stimuli that do not activate NF-kappaB. These results provide a mechanism of cellular resistance to killing by some apoptotic reagents, offer insight into a new role for NF-kappaB, and have potential for improvement of the efficacy of cancer therapies.

The effect of the aspirin metabolite salicylate on the growth of human colorectal tumor cell lines was determined. Salicylate showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on all of the cell lines (IC50, 1.65 +/- 0.36 to 7.38 +/- 1.08 mM), yet carcinoma and in vitro-transformed adenoma cell lines were more sensitive than adenoma cell lines. Salicylate caused all cell lines to accumulate in G0-G1 and induced apoptosis in carcinoma and in vitro-transformed adenoma cell lines but not in all adenoma cell lines. In those adenoma lines that did show salicylate-induced apoptosis, the extent was considerably less than that in the more transformed cell lines. The ability of salicylate to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and, in particular, the increased sensitivity of cells at later stages of neoplastic progression may be mechanistically important in the chemopreventive action of aspirin toward colorectal cancer.

They lower the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer and sulindac reduces the number and size of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. We studied the effect of sulindac, and its metabolite sulindac sulfide, on the proliferation of HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells. Both compounds reduced the proliferation rate of these cells, changed their morphology, and caused them to accumulate in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. These responses were time- and concentration-dependent and reversible. In addition, these compounds reduced the level and activity of several cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), which regulate cell cycle progression. Sulindac and sulindac sulfide also induced apoptosis in these cells at concentrations that affected their proliferation, morphology, and cell cycle phase distribution. Sulindac sulfide was approximately sixfold more potent than sulindac in inducing these cellular responses. Our results indicate that inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptotic cell death contribute to the anti-proliferative effects of sulindac and sulindac sulfide in HT-29 cells. These findings may be relevant to the cancer preventive and tumor regressive effects of these compounds in humans.

7606732|a|The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac is known to inhibit chemical carcinogenesis in rodent models and cause regression of adenomas in patients with adenomatous polyposis coli. Sulindac is a prodrug that is metabolized to a pharmacologically active sulfide derivative that potently inhibits prostaglandin synthesis. Recent studies, however, have shown that a sulfone derivative of sulindac, which essentially lacks prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory activity, also inhibits chemical carcinogenesis, suggesting that reduction of prostaglandin levels is not necessary for the antineoplastic activity of this class of drugs. Both sulindac sulfide and the sulfone inhibit the growth of cultured tumor cells, although the cellular mechanism(s) responsible for the antineoplastic activity of sulindac derivatives is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of sulindac sulfide and sulfone on the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells. Sulindac sulfide and sulfone significantly reduced cell number in both preconfluent and confluent cultures of HT-29 cells with the sulfide showing approximately 4-fold greater potency. In addition to HT-29 cells, both drugs inhibited the growth of a variety of tumor cell lines derived from other tissues, as well as normal epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Neither sulindac sulfide nor sulfone inhibited cell proliferation under conditions where the drugs were growth inhibitory. Only under specific conditions involving mitogenic stimulation did sulindac sulfide and sulfone cause cell cycle arrest. Neither sulindac sulfide nor the sulfone induced differentiation of HT-29 cells, but both drugs strongly induced apoptosis. The apoptotic response to sulindac sulfide and sulfone was both time- and dose-dependent and involved a mechanism independent of their inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression. These data suggest that apoptosis is responsible for the cell growth inhibitory activity of sulindac sulfide and sulfone and represents a potential mechanism for the antineoplastic activity of these drugs.

8549662|a|Aspirin and other NSAIDs reduce the incidence of and mortality from colon cancer, but their mechanism of action remains unknown. We evaluated the effect of aspirin (ASA) and three other structurally unrelated NSAIDs (indomethacin, naproxen, and piroxicam) on cell proliferation, cell cycle phase distribution, and the development of apoptosis in HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells in vitro. All of the NSAIDs examined reduced the proliferation and altered the morphology of these cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, they altered the cell cycle phase distribution of these cells. They increased the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase and reduced the proportion in the S phase of the cell cycle. ASA and indomethacin also reduced the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase, whereas naproxen and piroxicam did not. Parallel to their effect on cell cycle, ASA and indomethacin also reduced the levels of p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, two cyclin-dependent kinases that are important for cell cycle progression. Finally, all the NSAIDs analyzed, except ASA, induced apoptosis in these cells. There as a rough correlation between the relative potency of these compounds in inducing apoptosis and their effectiveness in retarding cell proliferation. Our findings indicate that NSAIDs can reduce the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cells in vitro. In addition, they cause cell cycle quiescence and apoptosis, both of which could account for their anti-proliferative effect. These findings suggest possible mechanisms for the cancer preventive effects of these compounds in humans.

8632912|a|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs lower the incidence of and mortality from colon cancer. Sulindac reduces the number and size of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. We have shown that sulindac and sulindac sulfide reversibly reduce the proliferation rate of HT-29 colon cancer cells, alter their morphology, induce them to accumulate in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and sulindac sulfide induces cell death by apoptosis. In this study we confirmed that sulindac and sulindac sulfide prevent HT-29 cells from progressing from the G0/G1 into the S phase. This block in cell cycle progression is associated with an initial rise, then an abrupt decrease in the levels of p34cdc2 protein. Sulindac and sulindac sulfide decrease the levels of mitotic cyclins, induce the levels of p21WAF-1/cip1, and reduce the total levels of pRB, with a relative increase in the amount of the underphosphorylated form of pRB in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, these compounds reduce the levels of mutant p53. These responses are not associated with intestinal cell differentiation and occur independent of the ability of these compounds to induce apoptosis. We conclude that sulindac and sulindac sulfide reduce the levels of major components of the molecular cell cycle machinery and alter the levels of several tumor suppressor proteins in a manner consistent with cell cycle quiescence. These mechanisms may be operative in vivo to account, in part, for the anti-neoplastic effects of these compounds.

2882424|a|The mechanism of replication of the simian virus 40 (SV40) genome closely resembles that of cellular chromosomes, thereby providing an excellent model system for examining the enzymatic requirements for DNA replication. Only one viral gene product, the large tumour antigen (large-T antigen), is required for viral replication, so the majority of replication enzymes must be cellular. Indeed, a number of enzymatic activities associated with replication and the S phase of the cell cycle are induced upon SV40 infection. Cell-free extracts derived from human cells, when supplemented with immunopurified SV40 large-T antigen support efficient replication of plasmids that contain the SV40 origin of DNA replication. Using this system, a cellular protein of relative molecular mass 36,000 (Mr = 36K) that is required for the elongation stage of SV40 DNA replication in vitro has been purified and identified as a known cell-cycle regulated protein, alternatively called the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or cyclin. It was noticed that, in its physical characteristics, PCNA closely resembles a protein that regulates the activity of calf thymus DNA polymerase-delta. Here we show that PCNA and the polymerase-delta auxiliary protein have similar electrophoretic behaviour and are both recognized by anti-PCNA human autoantibodies. More importantly, both proteins are functionally equivalent; they stimulate SV40 DNA replication in vitro and increase the processivity of calf thymus DNA polymerase-delta.

A nuclear protein called cyclin of relative molecular mass 36,000 (Mr 36K), whose synthesis correlates with the proliferative state of the cell, has been identified in several cell types of human, mouse, hamster and avian origin. The rate of cyclin synthesis is very low in quiescent cells and increases several fold after serum stimulation shortly before DNA synthesis. Immunofluorescence and autoradiography studies have shown that the nuclear staining patterns of cyclin during S phase have a sequential order of appearance and a clear correlation can be found between DNA synthesis and cyclin positive nuclei. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin have many common properties and it has been shown that these two are identical.

PCNA is also a target for autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus. The autoantigenicity of PCNA is highly conformation-dependent, and reaction with most anti-PCNA sera requires a nearly full-length PCNA molecule. Here we describe the use of gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation to analyze the native structure and size of PCNA. PCNA from three sources was studied (PCNA from HeLa cells, PCNA purified after its overexpression in bacteria, and PCNA produced in the wheat germ cell-free translation system) as well as mutant forms of PCNA translated in vitro. In each case, full-length PCNA behaved as a trimer. Analysis of mutant proteins revealed a correlation between the trimeric form and binding to the common type of human anti-PCNA autoantibody, suggesting that the Abs are specific for the active form of the protein. These findings are consistent with the idea that autoantibodies are generated as a response to native Ag and provide experimental support for the hypothesis that PCNA serves its processive function in DNA replication as a trimeric ring structure.

3745189|a|An auxiliary protein which affects the ability of calf thymus DNA polymerase-delta to utilize template/primers containing long stretches of single-stranded template has been purified to homogeneity from the same tissue. The auxiliary protein coelutes with DNA polymerase-delta on DEAE-cellulose and phenyl-agarose chromatography but is separated from the polymerase on phosphocellulose chromatography. The physical and functional properties of the auxiliary protein strongly resemble those of the beta subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. A molecular weight of 75,000 has been calculated from a sedimentation coefficient of 5.0 s and a Stokes radius of 36.5 A. A single band of 37,000 daltons is seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the protein exists as a dimer of identical subunits. The purified protein has no detectable DNA polymerase, primase, ATPase, or nuclease activity. The ability of DNA polymerase-delta to replicate gapped duplex DNA is relatively unaffected by the presence of the auxiliary protein, however, it is required to replicate templates with low primer/template ratios, e.g. poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (20:1), primed M13 DNA, and denatured calf thymus DNA. The auxiliary protein is specific for DNA polymerase-delta; it has no effect on the activity of calf thymus DNA polymerase-alpha or the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I with primed homopolymer templates. Although the auxiliary protein does not bind to either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA, it does increase the binding of DNA polymerase-delta to poly(dA)/oligo(dT), suggesting that the auxiliary protein interacts with the polymerase in the presence of template/primer, stabilizing the polymerase-template/primer complex.

2882507|a|A full-length cDNA clone for the human nuclear protein cyclin has been isolated by using polyclonal antibodies and sequenced. The sequence predicts a protein of 261 amino acids (Mr 29,261) with a high content of acidic (41, aspartic and glutamic acids) versus basic (24, lysine and arginine) amino acids. The identity of the cDNA clone was confirmed by in vitro hybrid-arrested translation of cyclin mRNA. Blot-hybridization analysis of mouse 3T3 and human MOLT-4 cell RNA revealed a mRNA species of approximately the same size as the cDNA insert. Expression of cyclin mRNA was undetectable or very low in quiescent cells, increasing after 8-10 hr of serum stimulation. Inhibition of DNA synthesis by hydroxyurea in serum-stimulated cells did not affect the increase in cyclin mRNA but inhibited 90% the expression of H3 mRNA. These results suggest that expression of cyclin and histone mRNAs are controlled by different mechanisms. A region of the cyclin sequence shows a significant homology with the putative DNA binding site of several proteins, specially with the transcriptional-regulator cAMP-binding protein of Escherichia coli, suggesting that cyclin could play a similar role in eukaryotic cells.

6151899|a|The effect of serum and growth factors [platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)] on the synthesis of the nuclear protein cyclin and its correlation with DNA synthesis has been studied in quiescent mouse 3T3 cells by means of quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Serum must be present in the medium for at least 8-12 h to induce maximal synthesis of cyclin (6- to 7-fold increase compared with quiescent cells). The stimulation of cyclin synthesis is dose-dependent and correlates directly with DNA synthesis. In addition, partially purified PDGF and FGF also induce cyclin and DNA synthesis in a coordinate way. Both growth factors, like serum, exhibit a similar lag phase to induce maximal cyclin (6- to 7-fold) and DNA synthesis (90% of the cells). Pure PDGF at a concentration as low as 10 ng/ml has the same effect as 10% serum. The coordinate induction of cyclin and DNA synthesis can only be observed with growth factors that induce DNA synthesis. These results strengthen the notion that cyclin is an essential component of the events leading to DNA replication.

2884104|a|The 'proliferating cell nuclear antigen' (PCNA), also known as cyclin, appears at the G1/S boundary in the cell cycle. Because of its possible relationship with cell proliferation, PCNA/cyclin has been receiving attention. PCNA/cyclin is a non-histone acidic nuclear protein with an apparent mol. wt of 33000-36000. The amino acid composition and the sequence of the first 25 amino acids of rabbit PCNA/cyclin are known. Using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the sequence of the first five amino acids, a cDNA clone for PCNA/cyclin was isolated from rat thymocyte cDNA library. The cDNA (1195 bases) contains an open reading frame of 813 nucleotides coding for 261 amino acids. The 3'-non-coding region is 312 nucleotides long and contains three putative polyadenylation signals. The mol. wt of rat PCNA/cyclin was calculated to be 28 748. The deduced amino acid sequence and composition of rat PCNA/cyclin are in excellent agreement with the published data. Using the cDNA probe, two species of mRNA (1.1 and 0.98 kb) were detected in rat thymocyte RNA. Southern blot analysis of total human genomic DNA suggests that there is a single gene coding for PCNA/cyclin. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat PCNA/cyclin has a similarity with that of herpes simplex virus type-1 DNA binding protein.

2899075|a|The enzymes of the DNA synthesizing machinery constitute a group of gene products that are generally expressed co-ordinately at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. We have investigated how growth factors regulate the steady-state mRNA levels of two of these genes, the PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen)/cyclin and the thymidine kinase genes. To detect the PCNA/cyclin mRNA, we isolated a cDNA clone from a human library. Two different cell lines were used for these studies: BALB/c3T3 cells, which are exquisitely sensitive to growth factors, and ts13 cells, a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of the cell cycle, which arrests in G1 at the restrictive temperature. The steady-state levels of the RNAs for these two genes under different growth conditions were also compared with the levels of histone H3 RNA which are good indicators of the fraction of cells in S phase. Both PCNA/cyclin and thymidine kinase genes share two fundamental characteristics, i.e. they are not inducible in a G1-specific ts mutant of the cell cycle at the restrictive temperature and their expression is inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that unlike early growth-regulated genes, they require the previous expression of other growth-regulated genes. However, the two genes also show differences, the most notable being that PCNA/cyclin is inducible by epidermal growth factor alone, while thymidine kinase is not.

1970160|a|The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is proving to be an useful and accurate model for eukaryotic DNA replication. It contains both DNA polymerase alpha (I) and delta (III). Recently, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which in mammalian cells is an auxiliary subunit of DNA polymerase delta and is essential for in vitro leading strand SV40 DNA replication, was purified from yeast. We have now cloned the gene for yeast PCNA (POL30). The gene codes for an essential protein of 29 kDa, which shows 35% homology with human PCNA. Cell cycle expression studies, using synchronized cells, show that expression of both the PCNA (POL30) and the DNA polymerase delta (POL3, or CDC2) genes of yeast are regulated in an identical fashion to that of the DNA polymerase alpha (POL1) gene. Thus, steady state mRNA levels increase 10-100-fold in late G1 phase, peak in early S-phase, and decrease to low levels in late S-phase. In addition, in meiosis mRNA levels increase prior to initiation of premeiotic DNA synthesis.

2568123|a|Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA/cyclin) is a nuclear protein that can stimulate purified DNA polymerase delta in vitro, and its synthesis correlates with the proliferation rate of cells. We have attempted to determine whether synthesis of PCNA/cyclin in Chinese hamster ovary cells is necessary to regulate entry into S phase. We have measured cellular PCNA/cyclin concentration of the mRNA or protein throughout the cell cycle. Cells were separated by centrifugal elutriation into populations enriched for G-1, S, and G-2/M phases. Quantitative Northern hybridization analysis was performed on RNA isolated from each cell population by using a cDNA clone of PCNA/cyclin as a probe. Results demonstrated that although intact PCNA/cyclin mRNA is present during all phases of the cell cycle, an induction of about 3-fold occurs during S phase. Two-parameter staining for PCNA/cyclin and DNA, and analysis by flow cytometry, confirmed that the quantity of PCNA/cyclin protein in the cells increases severalfold in G-1 or early S phase but generally is invariant in S and G-2/M phases. This cell cycle dependence of PCNA/cyclin expression suggests that the observed synthesis is a prerequisite for initiation of DNA replication. Introduction of an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the PCNA/cyclin mRNA to inhibit PCNA/cyclin synthesis effectively prevented entry of G-1 phase cells into S phase. A complementary sense oligonucleotide used as a control did not have an inhibitory effect. This result suggests that a threshold concentration of PCNA/cyclin is necessary for entry into S phase.

1358458|a|Human cyclin D1 has been associated with a wide variety of proliferative diseases but its biochemical role is unknown. In diploid fibroblasts we find that cyclin D1 is complexed with many other cellular proteins. Among them are protein kinase catalytic subunits CDK2, CDK4 (previously called PSK-J3), and CDK5 (also called PSSALRE). In addition, polypeptides of 21 kd and 36 kd are identified in association with cyclin D1. We show that the 36 kd protein is the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA. Cyclin D3 also associates with multiple protein kinases, p21 and PCNA. It is proposed that there exists a quaternary complex of D cyclin, CDK, PCNA, and p21 and that many combinatorial variations (cyclin D1, D3, CDK2, 4, and 5) may assemble in vivo. These findings link a human putative G1 cyclin that is associated with oncogenesis with a well-characterized DNA replication and repair factor.

8259214|a|Deregulation of cell proliferation is a hallmark of neoplastic transformation. Alteration in growth control pathways must translate into changes in the cell-cycle regulatory machinery, but the mechanism by which this occurs is largely unknown. Compared with normal human fibroblasts, cells transformed with a variety of viral oncoproteins show striking changes in the subunit composition of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In normal cells, CDKs exist predominantly in multiple quaternary complexes, each containing a CDK, cyclin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the p21 protein. However, in many transformed cells, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and p21 are lost from these multiprotein enzymes. Here we have investigated the significance of this phenomenon by molecular cloning of p21 and in vitro reconstitution of the quaternary cell-cycle kinase complexes. We find that p21 inhibits the activity of each member of the cyclin/CDK family. Furthermore, overexpression of p21 inhibits the proliferation of mammalian cells. Our results indicate that p21 may be a universal inhibitor of cyclin kinases.

8101826|a|In normal human diploid fibroblasts, cyclins of the A, B, and D classes each associate with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and p21, thereby forming multiple independent quaternary complexes. Upon transformation of diploid fibroblasts with the DNA tumor virus SV40, or its transforming tumor antigen (T), the cyclin D/p21/CDK/PCNA complexes are disrupted. In transformed cells, CDK4 totally dissociates from cyclin D, PCNA, and p21 and, instead, associates exclusively with a polypeptide of 16 kD (p16). Quaternary complexes containing cyclins A or B1 and p21/CDK/PCNA also undergo subunit rearrangement in transformed cells. Both PCNA and p21 are no longer associated with CDC2-cyclin B1 binary complexes. Cyclin A complexes no longer contain p21, and a new 19-kD polypeptide (p19) is found in association with cyclin A. The pattern of subunit rearrangement of cyclin-CDK complexes in SV40-transformed cells is also shared in those containing adeno- or papilloma viral oncoproteins. Rearrangement also occurs in p53-deficient cells derived from Li-Fraumeni patients that carry no known DNA tumor virus. These findings suggest a mechanism by which oncogenic proteins alter the cell cycle of transformed cells.

These include kinase complexes containing cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin D, associated either with CDC2, CDK2, CDK4, or CDK5. We show that PCNA and p21 form separate quaternary complex with each cyclin/CDK and that these quaternary complexes contain a substantial, if not major, fraction of the cell cycle kinases in asynchronously growing cells. These results suggest that PCNA and p21 may perform a common function for all these kinases.

7911228|a|The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Neither the low salt (0.1 M KCl) nor the high salt (0.8 M KCl) fractions are capable of repair synthesis but the combination of the two restore the repair synthesis activity. Using the repair synthesis assay we purified a protein of 37 kDa from the high salt fraction which upon addition to the low salt fraction restores repair synthesis activity. Amino acid sequence analysis, amino acid composition and immunoblotting with PCNA antibodies revealed that the 37 kDa protein is the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) known to stimulate DNA Polymerases delta and epsilon. By using an assay which specifically measures the excision of thymine dimers we found that PCNA is not required for the actual excision reaction per se but increases the extent of excision by enabling the excision repair enzyme to turn over catalytically.

Generation of incised intermediates depends on the XP-A protein, a polypeptide that recognizes sites of damaged DNA, and on the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein HSSB. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is required for the DNA synthesis that converts the nicked intermediates to completed repair events. This need for PCNA implies that repair synthesis is carried out by DNA polymerase delta or epsilon. The ability to visualize repair intermediates in the absence of PCNA facilitates dissection of the multiprotein reaction that leads to incision of damaged DNA in a major pathway of cellular defense against mutagens.

7935768|a|In mammalian cells, DNA damage increases the levels of the nuclear tumour-suppressor p53, resulting in elevated synthesis of p21, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). p21 may also directly block DNA replication by inhibiting the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an essential DNA replication protein. However, PCNA is also required for nucleotide-excision repair of DNA, an intrinsic part of the cellular response to ultraviolet irradiation. Using an in vitro system, we now show that p21 does not block PCNA-dependent nucleotide-excision repair, in contrast to its inhibition of simian virus 40 DNA replication. Furthermore, the short gap-filling DNA synthesis by PCNA-dependent DNA polymerases delta and epsilon is less sensitive to inhibition by p21 than is long primer-extension synthesis. The ability of p21 to inhibit the role of PCNA in DNA replication but not in DNA repair rationalizes in vivo data showing that genetic damage leads to inactivation of chromosomal replication while allowing damage-responsive repair.

Gadd45 was found to bind to PCNA, a normal component of Cdk complexes and a protein involved in DNA replication and repair.

8093810|a|Exposure of normal adult human skin to doses of UV irradiation that induced mild sunburn resulted in the rapid appearance of p53 protein in the epidermis and superficial dermal fibroblasts. Immunohistological analysis with a panel of antibodies established that while p53 staining was not seen in normal skin it appeared within 2 h of UV exposure. The level of p53 immunostaining peaked at 24 h and returned to undetectable levels within 360 h. The induction of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (which is required for both DNA replication and repair) followed a similar spatial and temporal pattern to p53. The UV irradiation did not induce a mitotic response or the replication-associated antigens DNA polymerase alpha or Ki67. The accumulation of high levels of p53 and PCNA in response to UV doses to which many human populations are routinely exposed provides strong support for a model in which normal p53 acts as part of the DNA damage response in vertebrate cells. Such a model is consistent with the profound tumour-suppressor function of the p53 gene, the high rate of p53 mutation in neoplasia and the exceptionally high tumour susceptibility of p53-deficient mice.

8570655|a|Proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a DNA damage-inducible protein that performs an essential function in DNA replication and repair as an auxiliary factor for DNA polymerases delta and epsilon. Examination of the human PCNA promoter DNA sequence revealed a site with homology to the consensus DNA sequence bound by p53. PCNA promoter fragments with this site intact bound p53 in vitro and were transcriptionally activated by wild-type p53 in transient expression assays in SAOS-2 cells. The resident p53-binding site could be functionally substituted by a previously described p53-binding site from the ribosomal gene cluster. A plasmid expressing a mutated version of p53 derived from a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome failed to activate the PCNA promoter in the cotransfection assay. In different cell types, activation of the PCNA promoter by the p53-binding sequence correlated with the status of p53. Activation of the PCNA promoter by wild-type p53 depends upon the level of p53 expression. This concentration dependence and cell type specificity reconciles the observations presented here with prior results indicating that wild-type p53 represses the PCNA promoter. These findings provide a mechanism whereby p53 modulates activation of PCNA expression as a cellular response to DNA damage.

A second domain also common to the N-terminal exon of the 12S and 13S proteins was required for the induction of mitosis and stimulation of proliferation of primary BRK cells. A virus containing a mutation in this region was still able to stimulate DNA synthesis efficiently. A third domain, unique to the 13S protein, was required for the accelerated activation of the cellular thymidylate synthase gene in a manner similar to the 13S-dependent stimulation of adenovirus early region genes.

1682506|a|The transforming region of adenovirus (E1) stimulates expression of a reporter construct linked to the promoter for the human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene in a cotransfection assay (G. F. Morris and M. B. Mathews, J. Biol. Chem. 264:13856-13864, 1989). The major products of the E1 region were assessed individually for their contribution to transactivation of the PCNA promoter. The E1A 13S and 12S products and the E1B 19-kDa product elevated expression from the PCNA promoter, whereas the E1B 55-kDa product did not. Induction of the PCNA promoter by E1A differed from transcriptional activation of the adenovirus E3 promoter in that the PCNA promoter is activated by the E1A 12S product whereas the E3 promoter is repressed; furthermore, the PCNA promoter is activated upon E1A overexpression, whereas the E3 promoter responds less well to high amounts of E1A. A site for the activating transcription factor ATF located approximately 50 nucleotides upstream from the transcription initiation site in the PCNA promoter mediates a positive response to the E1A 12S and 13S products.

1975809|a|The levels of the mRNA for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a DNA replication factor, increase upon growth stimulation of quiescent cells. To study the transcriptional aspect of this response, we have cloned a PCNA gene fragment from size-fractionated human placental DNA. This fragment contains 1269 nucleotides upstream from the PCNA transcriptional start site and includes an Alu sequence that is transcribed in vitro. The PCNA genomic DNA promotes transcription of a linked heterologous reporter gene in HeLa and 293 cells. Transient expression assays and in vitro transcription analyses showed that 249 nucleotides of upstream sequence are sufficient for full promoter activity in HeLa cells, whereas only 172 nucleotides are needed in 293 cells. Co-transfection with a plasmid expressing the adenovirus E1 gene transactivates the PCNA promoter in HeLa cells. An E1-responsive element maps in the 85-nucleotide region immediately upstream of the site of transcription initiation.

8095093|a|The adenovirus E1A oncoproteins interfere with the normal regulation of cellular proliferation through interactions with cell cycle regulatory proteins. In view of the essential role of proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in DNA replication, we performed a mutational analysis of the minimal human PCNA promoter (nucleotides -87 to +62) to define sequence elements which mediate transactivation by the 243-residue E1A protein (E1A 243R). Linker-scanning and site-directed mutants were examined for basal and E1A-induced expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) from PCNA promoter-CAT reporter constructs transiently expressed in HeLa cells. The results define the cis-acting element required for induction of PCNA by E1A 243R as a region between -59 and -45 relative to the transcription initiation site. This PCNA E1A-responsive element (PERE), which is protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear extracts from 293 cells, includes the sequence AGCGTGG immediately upstream of the ATF binding site previously shown to be important for activation of PCNA by E1A 243R (G. F. Morris and M. B. Mathews, J. Virol. 65:6397-6406, 1991). Mutation of either the upstream component or the ATF site within the PERE diminishes basal promoter activity and abrogates transactivation by E1A 243R. This novel cis-acting element is also essential for both basal and E1A-induced expression in the context of the full-length PCNA promoter.

7903420|a|Previous analyses defined a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) E1A-responsive element (PERE) in the PCNA promoter that is essential for transactivation by the 243-residue product of the adenovirus type 2 E1A 12S mRNA (E1A 243R). In this report, we show that the PERE activates a heterologous basal promoter and confers susceptibility to transactivation by E1A 243R, indicating that the PERE is both necessary and sufficient for the response of the PCNA promoter to this oncoprotein. Insertion of linker sequences between the PERE and the site of transcription initiation in the PCNA promoter severely impairs the promoter's response to E1A 243R transactivation. GAL4 sites can replace the function of the PERE in the E1A 243R response of the PCNA basal promoter if transcriptional activators of suitable strength are supplied as GAL4 fusion proteins. Weak transcriptional activators render the PCNA basal promoter subject to transactivation by E1A 243R but do not endow the adenovirus E1B basal promoter with a similar response. Strong transcriptional activators do not support transactivation by E1A 243R, however; instead, E1A reduces the ability of the strong activators to activate both the PCNA and E1B basal promoters. Although other mechanistic differences might determine the response, the data imply a relationship between the activation strength of promoter-proximal effectors and the response of the PCNA basal promoter to E1A 243R. These experiments indicate that the PERE can function autonomously in mediating transactivation by E1A 243R and that the PCNA basal promoter is configured in a manner that permits modulation by E1A 243R of transcriptional activation by promoter-proximal effectors.

7479004|a|The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an adenovirus E1A-inducible factor that is intimately linked to the processes of DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. Previously, we defined a novel cis-acting element, the PCNA E1A-responsive element (PERE), that confers induction by the E1A 243R oncoprotein upon the human PCNA promoter. To better understand the regulation of PCNA expression by E1A 243R, we have identified cellular transcription factors that associate with the PERE. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the PERE formed three major complexes (P1, P2 and P3) with proteins in nuclear extracts from HeLa or 293 cells. Formation of complexes P2 and P3, which correlates with PCNA promoter activity in vivo, requires the activating transcription factor (ATF) binding site found within the PERE [Labrie et al. (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol., 13, 1697-1707]. Antibody interference experiments and mobility shift assays performed with in vitro-synthesized protein indicated that the transcription factor ATF-1 is a major component of these complexes. Similar assays demonstrated that the hepatitis B virus enhancer-associated protein RFX1 constitutes a major component of the P1 complex. In addition, we examined the binding of proteins to the minimal E1A-responsive promoter to identify other factors important for transcription from the PCNA promoter. Mobility shift assays revealed that a fragment encompassing the region from -87 to +62 relative to the transcription initiation site forms at least five complexes, EH1-EH5, with HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The transcription factor YY1 associates with the initiator element of the PCNA promoter. The identification of these transcription factors will allow their roles in the activation of PCNA by E1A to be evaluated.

8065338|a|The B-cell POU homeodomain protein Oct-2 contains two transcriptional activation domains, one N terminal and the other C terminal of the central DNA-binding POU domain. The synergistic action of these two activation domains makes Oct-2 a more potent activator of mRNA promoters than the related broadly expressed octamer motif-binding protein Oct-1, which contains an N-terminal but not a C-terminal Oct-2-like activation domain. Both Oct-2 mRNA promoter activation domains were delineated by truncation analysis: the N-terminal Q domain is a 66-amino-acid region rich in glutamines, and the C-terminal P domain is a 42-amino-acid region rich in prolines. The Q and P domains synergized with each other or duplicates of themselves, independently of their N-terminal or C-terminal position relative to the POU domain. The C-terminal P domain, which differentiates Oct-2 from Oct-1, also activated transcription in conjunction with the heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Oct-2 thus contains three modular functional units, the DNA-binding POU domain and the two P and Q activation domains. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a variety of these Oct-2 activators revealed a distinct complex called QA that was dependent on the presence of an active glutamine-rich activation domain and migrated more slowly than the Oct-2-DNA complexes. Formation of the QA complex is consistent with interaction of the glutamine-rich activation domains with a regulatory protein important for the process of transcriptional activation.

8413673|a|Cyclic AMP-regulated gene expression frequently involves a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). Many transcription factors bind to this element, including the protein CREB, which is activated as a result of phosphorylation by protein kinase A. This modification stimulates interaction with one or more of the general transcription factors or, alternatively, allows recruitment of a co-activator. Here we report that CREB phosphorylated by protein kinase A binds specifically to a nuclear protein of M(r) 265K which we term CBP (for CREB-binding protein). Fusion of a heterologous DNA-binding domain to the amino terminus of CBP enables the chimaeric protein to function as a protein kinase A-regulated transcriptional activator. We propose that CBP may participate in cAMP-regulated gene expression by interacting with the activated phosphorylated form of CREB.

After transfection of human fibroblast cells with plasmid constructs carrying beta-galactosidase fusions, and subsequent infection with CMV, we have demonstrated that viral trans-acting functions up-regulate the expression of these genes in a temporally authentic manner. The alpha promoter is activated even when de novo protein synthesis is blocked and when UV-inactivated virus is used, suggesting that, as for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a virion structural protein is responsible for its up-regulation. We have found that HSV-1, as well as CMV, is capable of trans activating the CMV alpha promoter. The beta promoter is activated by CMV but is completely unresponsive to HSV-1 infection. The temporal synthesis of the alpha and beta promoters in the transient expression system conforms with their natural regulation during viral replication. The beta-galactosidase fusions we describe provide a most exquisitely sensitive indicator system for the study of cis- and trans-acting viral regulatory functions.

2136765|a|Cooperation of the nuclear oncogene E1A with the E1B oncogene is required for transformation of primary cells. Expression vectors were constructed to produce the 19-kilodalton (19K) and 55K E1B proteins under the direction of heterologous promoters in order to investigate the role of individual E1B proteins in transformation. Coexpression of E1A and either the 19K or 55K E1B gene products was sufficient for the formation of transformed foci in primary rat cells at half the frequency of an intact E1B gene, suggesting that the 19K and 55K proteins function via independent pathways in transformation. Furthermore, the effects of Ha-ras and the E1B 19K gene product were additive when cotransfected with E1A, suggesting that the 19K protein functions in transformation by a mechanism independent from that of ras as well. Although expression of E1A and either E1B protein was sufficient for the subsequent growth of cells in long-term culture, the 19K protein was required to support growth in semisolid media. As the 19K protein has been shown to associate with and disrupt intermediate filaments (IFs) when transiently expressed with plasmid vectors (E. White and R. Cipriani, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:9886-9890, 1989), the organization of IFs in transformed cells was investigated. Primary rat cells transformed by plasmids encoding E1A plus the E1B 19K protein showed gross perturbations of IFs, whereas cell lines transformed by plasmids encoding E1A plus the E1B 55K protein or E1A plus Ha-ras did not. These results suggest that an intact IF cytoskeleton may inhibit anchorage-independent growth and that the E1B 19K protein can overcome this inhibition by disrupting the IF cytoskeleton.

8093222|a|The adenovirus E1A 243R oncoprotein stimulates expression from the promoter of the human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). To gain insight into the mechanism of activation, we analyzed deletion and point mutations of the 243R protein for their abilities to activate PCNA promoter-directed reporter gene expression upon cotransfection into HeLa cells. Large deletions that in combination span the entire protein severely impaired the ability of E1A 243R to induce PCNA expression. Smaller deletions and specific point mutations that target specific E1A-binding proteins were less deleterious to PCNA induction. The data suggest that E1A activates transcription of the PCNA gene by multiple mechanisms and that, of the known 243R-associated proteins, p300 and p107-cyclin A can mediate the response while p105-RB does not appear to participate. Presumably, the functional redundancy ensures that 243R can activate expression of this essential DNA replication protein regardless of cell type and physiological conditions.

In contrast, another family member, CREB, has been shown to mediate Ca2+ and cAMP responses to similar levels.

The two proteins differ by a 14-amino acid serine-rich insertion present in one of the CREB isoforms. We show that both CREB isoforms are expressed in many cell types and mammalian species. Both encode proteins that bind specifically to a cAMP response element in vitro. As expected for proteins of this class, the CREB proteins bind DNA as dimers. Both proteins impart cAMP-regulated transcriptional activity to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, showing that cAMP directly modulates the transcriptional stimulatory activity of CREB. The presence of multiple CREB isoforms with identical DNA-binding specificities but differences in the presumed regulatory domain raises the possibility that CREB proteins may be able to integrate distinct regulatory signals at the level of gene transcription.

A large number of different proteins bind specifically to this element either as homodimers or as heterodimers. Using GAL4-ATF/CREB fusions, we have investigated the regulatory functions of three members of this family. CREB1 (CREB) is strongly activated by cAMP and weakly activated by the E1A protein. In contrast, CREB2 (CRE-BP1, ATF2) is strongly activated by E1A but is insensitive to cAMP stimulation. ATF1 is weakly activated by cAMP but is not activated by E1A. All three proteins are insensitive to activation by the HTLV1 tax protein. The N-terminal region of CREB2, from amino acid residues 19 to 112, is both necessary and sufficient for E1A activation. This region contains a putative C2H2 metal-binding finger, and single amino acid substitutions of the cysteine residues severely decreased CREB2 activity. In contrast, mutations affecting a potential protein kinase A and casein kinase II phosphorylation site within this region had little effect.

Recent experiments indicate that E1a contains a transcriptional activating region, which functions when directed to a promoter. Because E1a is not a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, how it targets to viral promoters has been a question. Several of the viral early promoters contain one or more binding sites for ATFs, a family of cellular transcription factors. Here we show that E1a can function through a specific ATF protein, designated ATF-2. We provide evidence that E1a interacts with a discrete region of promoter-bound ATF-2, thereby positioning the E1a activating region at a viral promoter.

2147221|a|Promoter elements containing the sequence motif CGTCA are important for a variety of inducible responses at the transcriptional level. Multiple cellular factors specifically bind to these elements and are encoded by a multigene family. Among these factors, polypeptides termed activating transcription factor 43 (ATF-43) and ATF-47 have been purified from HeLa cells and a factor referred to as cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) has been isolated from PC12 cells and rat brain. We demonstrated that CREB and ATF-47 are identical and that CREB and ATF-43 form protein-protein complexes. We also found that the cis requirements for stable DNA binding by ATF-43 and CREB are different. Using antibodies to ATF-43 we have identified a group of polypeptides (ATF-43) in the size range from 40 to 43 kDa. ATF-43 polypeptides are related by their reactivity with anti-ATF-43, DNA-binding specificity, complex formation with CREB, heat stability, and phosphorylation by protein kinase A. Certain cell types vary in their ATF-43 complement, suggesting that CREB activity is modulated in a cell-type-specific manner through interaction with ATF-43. ATF-43 polypeptides do not appear simply to correspond to the gene products of the ATF multigene family, suggesting that the size of the ATF family at the protein level is even larger than predicted from cDNA-cloning studies.

1655749|a|Many promoters respond transcriptionally to elevated levels of cAMP through the cAMP-responsive enhancer (CRE). Several proteins have been characterized which bind to the CRE and presumably modulate CRE-dependent transcription. Of these CRE-binding proteins, only CREB has been shown to be activated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and as such, CREB represents the only basis for our understanding of cAMP-regulated transcriptional activity. In this report, we describe the complete cDNA sequence of another CRE-binding protein, ATF-1. This protein contains a consensus phosphorylation site for PKA and shares extensive homology with CREB in the region surrounding and carboxyl-terminal to the PKA site. ATF-1 does not contain sequences homologous to the glutamine-rich amino-terminal domain found in CREB, however. ATF-1, like CREB, is expressed in a wide variety of cell types, and ATF-1 is capable of dimerizing with CREB. Both ATF-1 homodimers and ATF-1/CREB heterodimers bind to the CRE but not to the related phorbol ester response element. ATF-1 is as active as CREB in its ability to mediate the transcriptional effects of PKA, and, because ATF-1 has a smaller effect on basal expression, it is actually more responsive than CREB to cAMP. These findings indicate that CREB is not unique in its ability to mediate cAMP-dependent transcriptional regulation.

7870178|a|The cellular protein p300 is a target of the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein and is thought to participate in preventing the G0/G1 transition in the cell cycle, activating certain enhancers and stimulating differentiation pathways. CBP is a protein that is associated with and coactivates the transcription factor CREB, mediating the induction by cyclic AMP of certain responsive promoters. The sequences of p300 and CBP are highly related. We show here that p300, like CBP2, can stimulate transcription. This activity is directly and specifically inhibited by E1A. We also find that CBP exists in a DNA-bound complex containing a member of the CREB family and that E1A and CBP interact with one another in vivo. In keeping with the idea that E1A functionally targets CBP, cAMP-dependent transcription is repressed by E1A. Thus, p300 and CBP define a family of transcriptional adaptor proteins that are specifically targeted by the E1A oncoprotein.

Here, we show that CBP and p300 have similar binding affinity for the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB, and that p300 can substitute for CBP in potentiating CREB-activated gene expression. We find that E1A binds to CBP through a domain conserved with p300 and represses the CREB-dependent co-activator functions of both CBP and p300. Our results indicate that the gene repression and cell immortalization functions associated with E1A involve the inactivation of a family of related proteins that normally participate in second-messenger-regulated gene expression.

2521301|a|Three cellular proteins, including species of 300,000 daltons and 107,000 daltons as well as p105-RB, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, stably interact with the adenovirus E1A proteins. To help determine the functional basis of these interactions, the regions of E1A that participate in these interactions were mapped using a series of deletion mutants. The 300,000 dalton and the 107,000 dalton proteins interacted with sequences within amino acids 1 to 76 and 121 to 127, respectively. Interaction with the third cellular protein, p105-RB, required the presence of sequences from two noncontiguous regions of the E1A polypeptide chain, amino acids 30 to 60 and 121 to 127. The regions of E1A that are required for these interactions coincided precisely with the regions of E1A that are required for its transforming function. These results suggest that the interactions with these cellular proteins are fundamental to the transforming activity of E1A.

2143544|a|Adenovirus E1A transforming function requires two distinct regions of the protein. Transforming activity is closely linked with the presence of a region designated conserved domain 2 and the ability of this region to bind the product of the cellular retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene. We have investigated the biological properties of the second transforming region of E1A, which is located near the N terminus. Transformation-defective mutants containing deletions in the N terminus (deletion of residues between amino acids 2 and 36) were deficient in the ability to induce DNA synthesis and repress insulin enhancer-stimulated activity. The function of the N-terminal region correlated closely with binding of the 300-kilodalton E1A-associated protein and not with binding of the retinoblastoma protein. These results indicate that transformation by E1A is mediated by two functionally independent regions of the protein which interact with different specific cellular proteins and suggest that the 300-kilodalton E1A-associated protein plays a major role in E1A-mediated cell growth control mechanisms.

8552098|a|We have characterized a phosphoserine binding domain in the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) which interacts with the protein kinase A-phosphorylated, and hence activated, form of the cyclic AMP-responsive factor CREB. The CREB binding domain, referred to as KIX, is alpha helical and binds to an unstructured kinase-inducible domain in CREB following phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133. Phospho-Ser-133 forms direct contacts with residues in KIX, and these contacts are further stabilized by hydrophobic residues in the kinase-inducible domain which flank phospho-Ser-133. Like the src homology 2 (SH2) domains which bind phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, phosphoserine 133 appears to coordinate with a single arginine residue (Arg-600) in KIX which is conserved in the CBP-related protein P300. Since mutagenesis of Arg-600 to Gln severely reduces CREB-CBP complex formation, our results demonstrate that, as in the case of tyrosine kinase pathways, signal transduction through serine/threonine kinase pathways may also require protein interaction motifs which are capable of recognizing phosphorylated amino acids.

2155159|a|It has been shown previously that the adenovirus 2 (Ad2) E1A proteins repress activation of transcription by the SV40, polyomavirus and immunoglobulin gene enhancers. Here, we demonstrate that the repression of the SV40 enhancer is not specifically mediated by one of its constituent enhansons and/or proto-enhancers, but that each is subject to repression individually. This inhibitory effect of the E1A proteins is also observed with the AP-1 factor-binding enhansons from the polyomavirus and human metallothionein enhancers, and the MHC class I gene H-2Kb enhanson, which binds the KBF1/H2TF1/TC-IIB protein. Repression by the E1A gene products may, in fact, extend to all enhancer trans-activators, because the transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors (e.g., the estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors), of the yeast enhancer factor GAL4 expressed in HeLa cells, and of chimeric trans-activators (such as GAL-VP16) are all similarly inhibited. The E1A protein domains 2 and 3, including the acidic amino acid stretch that has been shown previously to be necessary for E1A-mediated trans-activation, are not required for repression. These results indicate that the amino-terminal region of the protein, which contains domain 1, plays a crucial role in repression, possibly by interfering in the transcriptional activation process at a step common to all trans-acting enhancer factors.

2143697|a|Adenovirus infection activates the E2F transcription factor, in part through the formation of a heteromeric protein complex involving a 19 kd E4 gene product that then allows cooperative and stable promoter binding. We now find that cellular factors are complexed to E2F in extracts of several uninfected cell lines. E1A proteins can dissociate these complexes, releasing free E2F. This activity of E1A is independent of conserved domain 3 but is dependent on conserved domain 2 sequence. The E1A-mediated dissociation of the complexes allows the E4 protein to interact with E2F, generating a stable DNA-protein complex with the E2 promoter and a stimulation of transcription. These experiments demonstrate a function for E1A in mediating a dissociation of transcription factor complexes, allowing new interactions to form and thus changing the transcriptional specificity.

The amount of RNA produced from the EIIa and EIII promoters was increased by the products of both the 13S and the 12S RNAs.

2141565|a|Adenovirus E1A dependent trans-activation of transcription involves the utilization of cellular promoter specific transcription factors. One such factor termed E2F is important for the transcription of the viral E2 gene and appears to be a rate limiting component targeted during the trans-activation event. Since E2F is of cellular origin and likely to be involved in cellular gene control, we have identified E2F binding sites in cellular genes. Examples include the c-myc, c-myb and N-myc protoncogenes, the DHFR gene and the EGF receptor gene. The transcription of these genes is regulated by cell proliferation signals and each falls into the so-called immediate early class: genes that are activated independent of new protein synthesis. Because of these common properties of regulation, we have addressed the possible role of E2F in growth factor dependent activation of transcription. Expression of a c-myc promoter driven CAT gene, transfected into quiescent 3T3 cells, is stimulated by serum addition whereas an identical gene containing mutations in the E2F binding sites is not responsive. The DNA binding activity of E2F is increased 4-fold upon serum stimulation and the kinetics of activation parallel activation of c-myc transcription. Furthermore, this increase in E2F activity is independent of new protein synthesis indicating that serum stimulation results in an activation of a pre-existing factor. These results thus provide strong evidence linking E2F and proliferation dependent control of transcription. We also believe that the E2F transcription factor is the first example of a regulator of the class of immediate early genes that is slowly activated by stimulation of cell proliferation.

8382609|a|The adenovirus E1A proteins differentially regulate AP-1-responsive genes. Collagenase and stromelysin are repressed by E1A, whereas the expression of c-jun is elevated. Inhibition of collagenase has been found to be exerted through the consensus AP-1 binding site TGAGTCA. Here we show that the distal AP-1 binding site in the c-jun promoter, the jun2TRE (TTACCTCA), is the decisive element of this promoter in mediating the positive response to the 243 amino acid E1A product. In vitro binding studies revealed that, in contrast to the consensus AP-1 site which is preferentially targeted by dimers composed of the Jun and Fos families, the jun2TRE binds heterodimers composed of cJun and ATF-2(-like) proteins. Since stimulation of c-jun transcription is a function of the transforming domain of E1A encoded by conserved region 1, cJun--ATF-2 may be one of the effector factors involved in transformation. The data further suggest that E1A can distinguish between cJun--cJun and cJun--ATF-2 in imposing opposite states of activity.

1710781|a|The transforming proteins of several DNA tumour viruses, including adenovirus E1a and simian virus 40 large T antigen, complex with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour-suppressor gene product. This requires regions in these viral proteins necessary for transformation and is thought to inactivate the growth-suppressing properties of the Rb protein by disrupting its interaction with cellular targets. Indeed, regions of Rb required to form a complex with E1a and large T antigen are often mutated in transformed cells. The level at which the Rb protein regulates proliferation is unknown, although one possibility is transcription. We have previously characterized a sequence-specific transcription factor, DRTF1, the activity of which is downregulated as embryonal carcinoma stem cells differentiate. DRTF1 is found in several discrete protein complexes (a, b and c) which are of different sizes but have the same DNA specificity. We now show that one of these also contains the Rb protein and, further, that the adenovirus E1a protein causes the dissociation of the Rb protein from this complex. This requires conserved regions 1 and 2 of E1a that are known to be required for efficient transformation. These results demonstrate that the Rb protein forms a complex with a DNA-bound transcription factor, and suggests that the Rb protein might act by regulating transcription.

1655281|a|A sequence within the transcription control region of the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter has been shown to mediate transcriptional activation by the adenovirus E1A protein. We report here that this same element mediates transcriptional repression in the absence of E1A. Two cellular proteins have been found to bind to overlapping regions within this sequence element. One of these proteins, YY1, is responsible for the repression. E1A relieves repression exerted by YY1 and further activates transcription through its binding site. A YY1-specific cDNA has been isolated. Its sequence reveals YY1 to be a zinc finger protein that belongs to the GLI-Krüppel gene family. The product of the cDNA binds to YY1 sites. When fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, it is capable of repressing transcription directed by a promoter that contains GAL4-binding sites, and E1A proteins can relieve the repression and activate transcription through the fusion protein.

7758944|a|YY1 represses transcription when bound upstream of transcriptional initiation sites. This repression can be relieved by adenovirus E1A. Here, we present genetic evidence that the ability of E1A to relieve YY1 repression was impaired by mutations that affect E1A binding to its associated protein p300. This suggests that E1A may modulate the repressor activity of YY1 by binding to p300, which may be physically complexed with YY1. A YY1/p300 protein complex in vivo was demonstrated by several independent approaches, and the YY1-interacting domain was mapped to the carboxy-terminal region of p300, distinct from the E1A-binding site. Unlike E2F/RB, the YY1/p300 complex is not disrupted by E1A. Functional studies using recombinant p300 demonstrated unequivocally that p300 is capable of mediating E1A-induced transcriptional activation through YY1. Taken together, these results reveal, for the first time, a YY1/p300 complex that is targeted by E1A and demonstrate a function for p300 in mediating interactions between YY1 and E1A. Our data thus identify YY1 as a partner protein for p300 and uncover a molecular mechanism for the relief of YY1-mediated repression by E1A.

UV-crosslinking of complexes containing unmodified, uniformly 32P-labelled DNA and purified E1A protein induced efficient labelling of the protein with covalently attached oligonucleotides, indicating that the E1A protein itself contacts DNA. Discrete nucleoprotein species were also observed when E1A protein--DNA complexes were analysed by gel electrophoresis. Although the 289R E1A protein exhibited no significant binding to single-stranded DNA or to RNA, no evidence for its sequence-specific binding to double-stranded DNA was obtained with either assay. Identification of the sites of covalent attachment of 32P-labelled oligonucleotides by partial proteolysis of the crosslinked E1A protein indicated that the interaction of this protein with DNA is mediated via domain(s) in the C-terminal half of the protein. Such previously unrecognized DNA-binding activity is likely to contribute to the regulatory activities of this important adenoviral protein.

We have now expressed in E. coli and purified the protein product encoded by the human subgroup C adenovirus E1A 12S mRNA and have compared the functional properties of this protein with those of the E1A 13S mRNA product. Using microinjection techniques to introduce these proteins into mammalian cells, we found that the E1A 12S mRNA product, like the 13S mRNA product, localized rapidly to the cell nucleus and induced adenovirus gene expression. Although both E1A gene products localized to the nucleus and stimulated adenovirus gene transcription, these proteins did not directly bind to DNA under conditions in which a known DNA-binding protein, the human c-myc gene product, bound DNA efficiently. Thus, the E1A and myc gene products, which have been related both structurally and functionally, exhibit distinctly different biochemical properties.

CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

7592747|a|The D1 reaction center protein of the membrane-bound photosystem II complex (PSII) has a much higher turnover rate than the other PSII proteins. Thus, the D1 protein has to be replaced while the other PSII components are not newly synthesized. In this study, this D1 protein replacement into PSII complexes was followed in two in vitro translation systems: isolated chloroplasts and a homologous run-off translation system consisting primarily of isolated thylakoids with attached ribosomes. The incorporation of newly synthesized radiolabeled products into different (sub)complexes was analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of n-dodecyl beta -D-maltoside-solubilized thylakoid membranes. This analysis allowed us to follow the release of the nascent polypeptide chains from the ribosomes and identification of at least four assembly steps of the PSII complex, as shown below. (i) Both in isolated chloroplasts and in thylakoids, newly synthesized D1 protein is predominantly incorporated into existing PSII subcomplexes, indicating that synthesis and import of nuclear-encoded factors is not needed for D1 protein replacement. (ii) In chloroplasts, D1 protein incorporation into PSII core complexes is more efficient than during translation in isolated thylakoids. In the thylakoid translation system, a large percentage of radiolabeled D1 protein is found in smaller PSII subcomplexes, like PSII reaction center particles, and as unassembled protein in the membrane. This indicates that stromal factors are required in the replacement process of the D1 protein. (iii) Both in isolated chloroplasts and in thylakoids, the other PSII core proteins D2, CP43, and CP47 are also synthesized and released from the membrane-bound ribosomes, but incorporation into PSII complexes occurs to a much smaller extent than the D1 protein. Instead they accumulate predominantly as unassembled proteins in the thylakoid membrane. (iv) In chloroplasts, synthesis of the D1 protein seems to be adjusted according to the possibilities of incorporation into PSII complexes, while synthesis of the D2 protein, CP43, and CP47 is less regulated and their accumulation as unassembled protein in the membrane is abundant.

8621638|a|The chloroplast-encoded D1 protein of photosystem II (PSII) has a much higher turnover rate than the other subunits of the PSII complex as a consequence of photodamage and subsequent repair of its reaction center. The replacement of the D1 protein in existing PSII complexes was followed in two in vitro translation systems consisting of isolated chloroplasts or isolated thylakoid membranes with attached ribosomes. By application of pulse-chase translation experiments, we followed translation elongation, release of proteins from the ribosomes, and subsequent incorporation of newly synthesized products into PSII (sub)complexes. The time course of incorporation of newly synthesized proteins into the different PSII (sub)complexes was analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Immediately after termination of translation, the D1 protein was found both unassembled in the membrane as well as already incorporated into PSII reaction center complexes, possibly due to a cotranslational association of the D1 protein with other PSII reaction center components. Later steps in the reassembly of PSII were clearly post-translational and sequential. Different rate-limiting steps in the assembly process were found to be related to the depletion of nuclear encoded and stromal components as well as the lateral migration of subcomplexes within the heterogeneous thylakoid membrane. The slow processing of precursor D1 in the thylakoid translation system revealed that processing was not required for the assembly of the D1 protein into a PSII (sub)complex and that processing of the unassembled precursor could take place. The limited incorporation into PSII subcomplexes of three other PSII core proteins (D2 protein, CP43, and CP47) was clearly post-translational in both translation systems. Radiolabeled assembly intermediates smaller than the PSII core complex were found to be located in the stroma-exposed thylakoid membranes, the site of protein synthesis. Larger PSII assembly intermediates were almost exclusively located in the appressed regions of the membranes.

To study the regulation of D1 accumulation, a chimeric uidA gene encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS) under control of the psbA 5'- and 3'-regulatory regions (224 and 393 bp, respectively), was integrated into the tobacco plastid genome. A high level of GUS accumulation in leaves and the lack of GUS in roots, with uidA mRNA present in both tissues, indicated tissue-specific accumulation of the chimeric gene product. Light-regulated accumulation of GUS in seedlings was shown. (i) Light-induced accumulation (100-fold) of GUS in etiolated cotyledons was accompanied by only a modest increase in mRNA levels. (ii) Inhibition of GUS synthesis was observed in cotyledons when light-grown seedlings were transferred to the dark, with no reduction in mRNA levels. Tissue-specific and light-regulated accumulation of GUS indicates that D1 accumulation is controlled via cis-acting regulatory elements in the untranslated region of the psbA mRNA. We propose that in tobacco, control of translation initiation is the primary mechanism regulating D1 protein accumulation.

Binding of these proteins protects a 36 base RNA fragment containing a stem-loop located upstream of the ribosome binding site. Binding of these proteins to the psbA mRNA correlates with the level of translation of psbA mRNA observed in light- and dark-grown wild type cells and in a mutant that lacks D1 synthesis in the dark. The accumulation of at least one of these psbA mRNA-binding proteins is dependent upon chloroplast development, while its mRNA-binding activity appears to be light modulated in developed chloroplasts. These nuclear encoded proteins are prime candidates for regulators of chloroplast protein synthesis and may play an important role in coordinating nuclear-chloroplast gene expression as well as provide a mechanism for regulating chloroplast gene expression during development in higher plants.

8187775|a|Light-regulated translation of chloroplastic mRNAs in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii requires nuclear encoded factors that interact with the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of specific mRNAs to enhance their translation. We have previously identified and characterized a set of proteins that bind specifically to the 5'-UTR of the chloroplastic psbA mRNA. Accumulation of these proteins is similar in dark- and light-grown cells, whereas their binding activity is enhanced during growth in the light. We have identified a serine/threonine protein phosphotransferase, associated with the psbA mRNA-binding complex, that utilizes the beta-phosphate of ADP to phosphorylate and inactivate psbA mRNA-binding in vitro. The inactivation of mRNA-binding in vitro is initiated at high ADP levels, levels that are attained in vivo only in dark-grown chloroplasts. These data suggest that the translation of psbA mRNA is attenuated by phosphorylation of the mRNA-binding protein complex in response to a rise in the stromal concentration of ADP upon transfer of cells to dark.

7992056|a|Translation of key proteins in the chloroplast is regulated by light. Genetic and biochemical studies in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii suggest that light may regulate translation by modulating the binding of activator proteins to the 5' untranslated region of chloroplast messenger RNAs. In vitro binding of the activator proteins to psbA messenger RNA and in vivo translation of psbA messenger RNA is regulated by the redox state of these proteins, suggesting that the light stimulus is transduced by the photosynthesis-generated redox potential.

1547887|a|In an in vitro translation experiment using spinach chloroplasts, a novel protein band of about 17.5 kDa appeared by light to dark transition. The protein never accumulated in detectable amounts either in continuous illumination or in continuous darkness. The 17.5 kDa protein accumulated upon light-dark transition, on the other hand, disappeared by the subsequent illumination. Accumulation of the protein in light, however, was observed when stromal level of ATP in chloroplasts was lowered after preillumination by the addition of various chemical compounds which, irrespective of the mode of action, eventually decrease the ATP level, e.g. atrazine, carbonyl-cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone and glycerate. The dark-accumulated protein was concluded to be a translation intermediate of D1 protein based on the facts that this component precipitates with specific antibodies and is resistant to lysylendopeptidase treatment. The suppression by chloramphenicol of both appearance upon light-dark transition and disappearance by the subsequent illumination of the protein also supported this conclusion. The phenomenon was discussed in terms of pausing in the translation of psbA mRNA.

8428635|a|In the presence of externally added ATP, in the dark, isolated pea chloroplasts accumulate two proteins of molecular masses of about 22 and 24 kDa which precipitate with specific antibodies raised against the D1 protein. By chasing in the light, these proteins disappeared on the fluorogram concomitant with the appearance of the precursor- and mature-sized D1 proteins. Polysome analysis indicated that the 22-kDa component is associated with membrane-bound ribosomes and is thus ascribed to a translation intermediate of the D1 protein. On the other hand, the 24-kDa component could not be found in the polysome fraction under the experimental condition used, suggesting the possibility that this component is a degradation product of the D1 protein. The conclusion from this analysis is that the synthesis and/or stable accumulation of the D1 protein requires factor(s) caused by illumination, in addition to ATP, in isolated pea chloroplasts.

Under high light conditions, steady-state levels of psbA, psbD and psbD-C transcripts were higher while levels of rbcL-S transcripts were lower than under low light conditions. rrn transcripts accumulated in the dark and the transcript levels were the same under illuminated conditions. Analyses of constructed Synechocystis 6803 mutants showed that both psbA-2 and psbA-3 could produce high levels of transcripts under illuminated conditions. No psbA-1 transcripts were detected.

8106338|a|The three psbA genes in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 encode two distinct forms of the D1 protein of photosystem II. The psbAI message, which encodes form I, dominates the psbA transcript pool at low to moderate light intensities; however, exposure to high light triggers a response in which the psbAI message is actively degraded while psbAII and psbAIII, which encode form II, are transcriptionally induced. We addressed whether these changes result from a generalized stress response and examined the consequence of light-responsive psbA regulation on the composition of D1 in thylakoid membranes. Heat shock and oxidative stress had some effect on levels of the three psbA transcripts but did not produce the responses generated by an increase in light intensity. Prolonged exposure to high light (24-h time course) was characterized by elevated levels of all psbA transcripts through maintenance of high levels of psbAII and psbAIII messages and a rebound of the psbAI transcript after its initial decline. Form II-encoding transcripts were enriched relative to those encoding form I at all high-light time points. Form II replaced form I in the thylakoid membrane at high light despite an abundance of psbAI transcript at later time points; this may be explained by the observed faster turnover of form I than form II in the membrane. We propose that form II is less susceptible to damage at high light and that this qualitative alteration, coupled with increased turnover of D1, protects the cells from photoinhibition.

2496127|a|The psbA multigene family in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 encodes two forms of the D1 protein; Form I, the product of psbAI, differs from Form II, the product of psbAII and psbAIII, at 25 of 360 amino acid positions. D1 is essential for photosynthesis as a protein component of the photosystem II reaction center. Antisera were raised against purified hybrid proteins encoded by psbAI-lacZ and psbAIII-lacZ translational gene fusions that contain the unique amino termini of Form I and Form II, respectively. Form specificity of each antiserum was verified by Western analysis using thylakoid membranes from mutant strains containing only Form I or Form II. Western analysis of thylakoid membranes from wild-type cells cultured at different light intensities detected both forms of D1 in the membrane and showed changes in the ratio of the two forms. The D1 composition of the membrane matched predicted ratios of the forms based on differential gene expression: psbAI is expressed highest at low light, and both psbAII and psbAIII are expressed highest at high light. Along a gradient of light intensity from 5 microE. m-2.s-1 to 482 microE.m-2.s-1, the relative amount of Form I in thylakoid membranes decreased 58%, while the relative amount of Form II increased 60%. Maximum detection of Form I coupled with minimum detection of Form II in membranes from cells harvested at light intensities below 390 microE.m-2.s-1 suggests a central role for Form I in photosystem II. Increased incorporation of Form II into the thylakoid membrane occurred at light intensities reported by others to be photoinhibitory, suggesting that Form II serves a role in adaptation to high light.

1932686|a|We have cloned and sequenced the psaA and psaB genes from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. These genes are arranged in tandem, are co-transcribed, and are highly homologous to the psaA and psaB genes previously characterized. RNA was isolated from light-grown cells, from cells put in total darkness with and without glucose, and from cells grown under light-activated heterotrophic growth (LAHG) conditions. Quantitation of hybridization to northern blots revealed only a slight decrease in the accumulation of the psaA-psaB transcript in cells grown in complete darkness with glucose and in LAHG cells, relative to light-grown cells. Accumulation of the psbA transcript steadily declines through dark incubation, with a steady-state level in LAHG cells 28% of that in light-grown cells. Transcripts from psbD, psaD, and rbcLS accumulate in cells grown in complete darkness and in LAHG cells to approximately the same levels as in light-grown cells. Photosynthesis gene transcripts in cells grown in the dark without glucose were detected, but were highly degraded. Our data prove that transcripts from photosynthesis genes do accumulate in dark-grown Synechocystis 6803, which may allow for synthesis and assembly of photosystem (PS) I and PS II in the dark.

2349216|a|Chlorophyll apoprotein accumulation in higher plant chloroplasts is controlled by light-dependent chlorophyll formation. Dark-grown plants lack chlorophyll and chlorophyll apoproteins. However, the plastid genes encoding the chlorophyll apoproteins are transcribed; chlorophyll apoprotein mRNA accumulates and associates with polysomes in plastids of dark-grown plants. Pulse-labeling assays revealed a population of short-lived proteins in plastids of dark-grown plants. One of these transiently labeled proteins was CP43, a chlorophyll apoprotein associated with photosystem II. Pulse-chase assays showed that newly synthesized CP43 was rapidly degraded in plastids of dark-grown plants, which lack chlorophyll. In contrast, CP43 synthesized in plastids from illuminated plants was stable. The synthesis of D1, a chlorophyll apoprotein of the photosystem II reaction center, was also analyzed in plastids of dark-grown and illuminated plants. Radiolabel accumulation into full-length D1 was only detected in plastids of illuminated plants. However, D1 translation intermediates of 15-25 kDa were detected in both plastid populations. Pulse-chase assays showed that the 15- to 25-kDa D1 translation products were precursors of mature D1 in plastids of illuminated plants. In contrast, in plastids of dark-grown plants, the 15- to 25-kDa translation intermediates were converted into a 23-kDa polypeptide previously suggested to be a proteolytic product of D1. These results indicate that chlorophyll produced in illuminated plants stabilizes D1 nascent polypeptides, which allows accumulation of mature D1.

8165261|a|Chlorophyll protein accumulation in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) chloroplasts is controlled posttranscriptionally by light-induced formation of chlorophyll a. The abundance of translation initiation complexes associated with psbA, psaA, and rbcL mRNAs was measured using extension and inhibition analysis in plants grown in the dark for 4.5 d and then illuminated for up to 16 h. Light-induced accumulation of the chlorophyll proteins was not accompanied by changes in the abundance of translation initiation complexes, indicating that regulation of chlorophyll protein accumulation at this stage of development does not occur at the level of translation initiation. Translational runoff assays were performed in the presence of lincomycin, an inhibitor of translation initiation, to determine whether chlorophyll protein accumulation was regulated at the level of translation elongation. The extent of ribosome runoff of psaA and psbA mRNAs was similar in the presence or absence of chlorophyll, indicating that chlorophyll did not alter chlorophyll protein translation elongation. Polysome-associated D1 translation intermediates were radiolabeled in the presence or absence of chlorophyll, even though full-length D1 accumulated only in the presence of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll influenced the stability of D1 translation intermediates to a small extent and greatly increased D1 stability after release from ribosomes. Overall, these results demonstrate that light-induced chlorophyll biosynthesis triggers the accumulation of the chlorophyll proteins D1 and P700 in barley chloroplasts by enhancement of chlorophyll apoprotein stability.

1869532|a|Photosynthetic reaction center protein D1 contains five membrane-spanning alpha-helices which form binding sites for pheophytin, chlorophyll, carotenoids, quinone, Fe2+, and probably Mn2+. D1 translation intermediates of 15 to 28 kD were detected when isolated chloroplasts were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine. The D1 translation intermediates were associated with membrane polysomes and can be chased into full length D1. The sites of translation pausing were determined by mapping the distribution of ribosomes on D1 mRNA using toeprint analysis. Clusters of toeprint signals were generated by D1 mRNA associated with membranes but not by D1 mRNA in nonpolysomal fractions of the soluble phase or phenol-extracted mRNA. The distribution of ribosomes on D1 mRNA determined by toeprint analysis was consistent with D1 translation intermediates observed with pulse-labeling. Ribosome pausing may facilitate co-translational binding of co-factors such as chlorophyll to D1 and aid the integration of D1 into thylakoid membranes.

8027048|a|The chloroplast photosystem II reaction center protein D1 contains five membrane-spanning helices and binds chlorophyll, carotenoid, quinone, iron, and probably manganese. Turnover of pulse-labeled D1 in isolated plastids was found to involve cleavage between helix IV and helix V, which releases a 23-kDa N-terminal peptide and two C-terminal peptides of 10 and 8 kDa. Ribosomes pause at specific sites during translation of D1, which results in the accumulation of D1 translation intermediates. Pulse-labeling assays followed by polysome isolation and immunoprecipitation identified paused D1 translation intermediates of 9, 12.5, 15-18, 20, 21, 24, and 28-32 kDa. Ribosome pausing was not altered when dark-grown seedlings were illuminated for up to 1 h, even though this treatment stimulated accumulation of chlorophyll and D1. However, illumination of plants for 16-72 h resulted in increased ribosome pausing and the build-up of D1 translation intermediates. We hypothesize that ribosome pausing during synthesis of D1 improves the efficiency of chlorophyll binding of D1 nascent chains and enhances accumulation of D1 in mature chloroplasts, which have reduced rates of chlorophyll biosynthesis.

2643058|a|It has long been suspected that chloroplasts evolved after an endosymbiotic event involving a photosynthetic prokaryote, presumably a cyanobacterium, and a eukaryotic organism. Recent studies have provided strong evidence about the cyanobacterial nature of chloroplasts. Since the discovery of prochlorophytes, oxygen-evolving photosynthetic prokaryotes containing chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and lacking phycobiliproteins, there has been speculation that these represent evolutionary intermediates between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. Prochloron sp., the first described prochlorophyte, proved difficult to work with because it is an obligate symbiont of marine ascidians. Prochlorothrix hollandica, a recently isolated, freshwater filamentous prochlorophyte, is easily maintained in the laboratory. Overall pigment composition and thylakoid membrane structure of P. hollandica suggest it has intermediate characteristics between cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of higher plants. The P. hollandica psbA genes, which encode the photosystem II thylakoid protein D1, were cloned and sequenced and the sequences compared to those reported for cyanobacteria, a green alga, a liverwort, and several higher plants. The two psbA genes present in P. hollandica encode an identical amino-acid sequence. As in all chloroplast psbA genes, there is a seven amino-acid gap near the C terminus of the derived protein relative to the protein predicted by cyanobacterial genes, suggesting that P. hollandica is part of the lineage that led to chloroplasts after a divergence from cyanobacteria. This hypothesis is also supported by phylogenetic analysis of derived D1 amino-acid sequences from psbA genes of thirteen taxa on the basis of parsimony.

8058761|a|The D1 protein of the photosystem II (PSII) complex in the thylakoid membrane of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide (pD1) with a C-terminal extension. Posttranslational processing of the pD1 protein is essential to establish water oxidation activity of the PSII complex. We have recently identified a gene, ctpA, a mutation in which resulted in a loss of PSII activity in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. To study the function of the CtpA protein, we inactivated the ctpA gene by inserting a kanamycin-resistance gene into its coding sequence. The resultant mutant strain, T564, had no PSII-mediated water oxidation activity, but it had normal cytochrome b6f and photosystem I activities. Measurements of thermoluminescence profiles and rates of reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol indicated that PSII complexes in the mutant cells had functional reaction centers that were unable to accept electrons from water. Immunoblot analysis showed that D1, D2, CP47, CP43, and the alpha subunit of cytochrome b559, five integral membrane proteins of PSII, were present in T564 cells. Interestingly, the D1 protein in the mutant cells was 2 kDa larger than that in wild-type cells, due to the presence of a C-terminal extension. We conclude that the CtpA protein is a processing enzyme that cleaves off the C-terminal extension of the D1 protein. Interestingly, the CtpA protein shows significant sequence similarity to the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding proteins in the bovine, human, and insect eye systems.

(1986) FEBS Lett. 205, 269-274) to be inactive for light-driven oxygen evolution, despite a functional Photo-system II reaction center. A polypeptide, D1, implicated in the ligation of the primary photoreactants of photosystem II, was shown to migrate with an apparent higher molecular mass on LDS-PAGE in the mutant than in the wild-type (WT) strain. We show here that polypeptide D1 is synthesized in a precursor form in Scenedesmus WT. Following synthesis and insertion into the thylakoid membrane, a 1.5-2-kDa oligopeptide is clipped off with a half-time of 1-2 min, yielding the mature 34-kDa form of the polypeptide. No processing of polypeptide D1 from mutant LF-1 was observed to take place. We show here that polypeptide D1 of LF-1 displays an identical proteolytic fingerprint pattern to the precursor D1 polypeptide of the wild-type strain. These both have molecular masses about 1.5-2 kDa higher than that of the mature WT polypeptide. A polyclonal antibody elicited by a synthetic oligopeptide (14-mer), predicted from the psbA gene nucleotide sequence to be homologous to the COOH terminus of the precursor D1 of spinach, cross-reacts only with D1 of mutant LF-1 and not with mature D1 of spinach, Chlamydomonas, or of Scenedesmus WT. This observation demonstrates that the greater molecular mass of polypeptide D1 from mutant LF-1 and of Scenedesmus WT precursor D1 is derived from a COOH-terminal extension. We conclude that the LF-1 mutant lacks the appropriate nuclear-encoded protease which processes polypeptide D1 at its COOH terminus from the precursor to the mature form. Such processing would appear to be a necessary step toward the stable incorporation of manganese into the oxygen-evolving site.

1420199|a|The D1 polypeptide of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide which is posttranslationally processed at the carboxy terminus. It has been shown in spinach that such processing removes nine amino acids, leaving Ala344 as the C-terminal residue [Takahashi, M., Shiraishi, T., & Asada, K. (1988) FEBS Lett. 240, 6-8; Takahashi, Y., Nakane, H., Kojima, H., & Satoh, K. (1990) Plant Cell Physiol. 31, 273-280]. We show here that processing on the carboxy side of Ala344 also occurs in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, resulting in the removal of 16 amino acids. By constructing a deletion strain of Synechocystis 6803 that lacks the three copies of the psbA gene encoding D1, we have developed a system for generating psbA mutants. Using this system, we have constructed mutants of Synechocystis 6803 that are modified in the region of the C-terminus of the D1 polypeptide. Characterization of these mutants has revealed that (1) processing of the D1 polypeptide is blocked when the residue after the cleavage site is changed from serine to proline (mutant Ser345Pro) with the result that the manganese cluster is unable to assemble correctly; (2) the C-terminal extension of 16 amino acid residues can be deleted with little consequence either for insertion of D1 into the thylakoid membrane or for assembly of D1 into a fully active PSII complex; (3) removal of only one more residue (mutant Ala344stop) results in a loss of assembly of the manganese cluster; and (4) the ability of detergent-solubilized PSII core complexes (lacking the manganese cluster) to bind and oxidize exogenous Mn2+ by the secondary donor, Z+, is largely unaffected in the processing mutants (the Ser345Pro mutant of Synechocystis 6803 and the LF-1 mutant of Scenedesmus obliquus) and the truncation mutant Ala344stop. Our results are consistent with a role for processing in regulating the assembly of the photosynthetic manganese cluster and a role for the free carboxy terminus of the mature D1 polypeptide in the ligation of one or more manganese ions of the cluster.

1517201|a|Synthesis of the photosystem II D1 protein as a precursor with a carboxyl-terminal extension occurs in almost all eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms examined so far, as well as in cyanobacteria. Processing of the D1 precursor has been recently postulated to play a regulatory role in the light-dependent migration of photosystem II units from the unstacked to the stacked thylakoids (Bowyer, J. M., Packer, J. C. L., McCormack, B. A., Whitelegge, J. P., Robinson, C., and Taylor, M. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5424-5433). To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation have been used to create a "preprocessed" mutant Chlamydomonas strain which synthesizes mature D1 protein directly. We have found that this strain is indistinguishable from wild type in terms of photosynthetic performance and cell doubling time under CO2- and light-saturated photoautotrophic growth conditions.

1623177|a|The D1-precursor protein of the photosystem II reaction centre contains a carboxy-terminal extension whose proteolytic removal is necessary for oxygen-evolving activity. To address the question of the role of the carboxy-terminal extension in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we truncated D1 by converting codon Ser345 of the psbA gene into a stop codon. Particle gun transformation of an in vitro modified psbA gene fragment also carrying mutations conferring herbicide resistance yielded a homoplasmic transformant containing the stop codon. Since oxygen evolution capacity is not affected in this mutant as compared with herbicide-resistant control cells, the carboxy-terminal extension is dispensable for a functional photosystem II complex under normal growth conditions.

1902208|a|A glucose-tolerant strain of Synechocystis sp. strain 6803 will not grow on glucose under complete darkness unless given a daily pulse of white light, typically 5 min of 40 mumol m-2 s-1 (light-pulsed conditions). The light pulse is insufficient for photoautotrophy, as glucose is required and growth yield is dependent on glucose concentration. Growth rate is independent of fluence, but growth yield is dependent on fluence, saturating at 40 to 75 mumol m-2 s-1. A Synechocystis strain 6803 psbA mutant strain grows under light-pulsed conditions at rates similar to those for the glucose-tolerant strain, indicating that photosystem II is not required for growth. The relative spectral sensitivity of the growth of light-pulsed cultures (growth only in blue light, 400 to 500 nm, maximum at 450 nm) precludes energetic contribution from cyclic electron transport around photosystem I. Pulses of long-wavelength light (i.e., 550 and 650 nm) did not support the growth of Synechocystis strain 6803 and, when supplied before or after a blue-light pulse, did not inhibit blue-light-stimulated growth of Synechocystis strain 6803. We conclude that the required blue-light pulse does not support growth via photosynthetic electron transport but appears instead to function as an environmental signal regulating heterotrophic metabolism, cell division, or other photomorphogenic processes. We have termed the growth of Synechocystis strain 6803 pulsed with light and kept otherwise in complete darkness light-activated heterotrophic growth. This observation of a blue-light requirement for the growth of Synechocystis strain 6803 represents a novel blue light effect on the growth of a cyanobacterium.

8555457|a|Part of the chlL gene encoding a component involved in light-independent protochlorophyllide reduction was deleted in wild type and in a photosystem I-less strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In resulting mutants, chlorophyll biosynthesis was fully light-dependent. When these mutants were propagated under light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions (in darkness except for 15 min of weak light a day) for several weeks, essentially no chlorophyll was detectable but protochlorophyllide accumulated. Upon return of the chlL- mutant cultures to continuous light, within the first 6 h chlorophyll was synthesized at the expense of protochlorophyllide at a rate independent of the presence of photosystem I. Chlorophyll biosynthesized during this time gave rise to a 685 nm fluorescence emission peak at 77 K in intact cells. This peak most likely originates from a component different from those known to be directly associated with photosystems II and I. Development of 695 and 725 nm peaks (indicative of intact photosystem II and photosystem I, respectively) required longer exposures to light. After 6 h of greening, the rate of chlorophyll synthesis slowed as protochlorophyllide was depleted. In the chlL- strain, greening occurred at the same rate at two different light intensities (5 and 50 microE m-2 s-1), indicating that also at low light intensity the amount of light is not rate-limiting for protochlorophyllide reduction. Thus, in this system the rate of chlorophyll biosynthesis is limited neither by biosynthesis of photosystems nor by the light-dependent protochlorophyllide reduction. We suggest the presence of a chlorophyll-binding 'chelator' protein (with 77 K fluorescence emission at 685 nm) that binds newly synthesized chlorophyll and that provides chlorophyll for newly synthesized photosynthetic reaction centers and antennae.

8463274|a|Several mutations in psbD (coding for the photosystem II reaction protein D2) lead to a loss of the entire photosystem II complex from the thylakoid membrane. For two site-directed D2 mutants, E69V (Glu-69 mutated to Val) and ET-9 (introducing a premature stop codon in psbD), and two psbD deletion mutants, the synthesis and degradation of photosystem II reaction center components were analyzed. In E69V, no D2 or psbC-encoded CP43 was detected upon 5-min pulse labeling or Western blotting, whereas a psbDI/C transcript was present. Either D2 and CP43 are very unstable in this mutant, or the mutation causes an inhibition of translation of the psbDC operon. In E69V, the predominant lifetime of D1 is several minutes, but a small fraction of D1 remains stable in the thylakoid for several hours. In E69V, also a 43-kDa band is detected by D1 antisera. We attribute this band to a D1 cross-linking product possibly involved in D1 degradation. We identified a D1 precursor in E69V and psbDI/C/DII-, two mutants with particularly short D1 lifetimes. A unique feature of the E69V mutant is that destabilization of the photosystem II complex is triggered by a single-site mutation leading to extremely rapid turnover or lack of synthesis of D2.

7862084|a|We isolated a 38 kDa ssDNA-binding protein from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 6301 and determined its N-terminal amino acid sequence. A genomic clone encoding the 38 kDa protein was isolated by using a degenerate oligonucleotide probe based on the amino acid sequence. The nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence revealed that the 38 kDa protein is 306 amino acids long and homologous to the nuclear-encoded 370 amino acid chloroplast ribosomal protein CS1 of spinach (48% identity), therefore identifying it as ribosomal protein (r-protein) S1. Cyanobacterial and chloroplast S1 proteins differ in size from Escherichia coli r-protein S1 (557 amino acids). This provides an additional evidence that cyanobacteria are closely related to chloroplasts. The Synechococcus gene rps1 encoding S1 is located 1.1 kb downstream from psbB, which encodes the photosystem II P680 chlorophyll a apoprotein. An open reading frame encoding a potential protein of 168 amino acids is present between psbB and rps1 and its deduced amino acid sequence is similar to that of E. coli hypothetical 17.2 kDa protein. Northern blot analysis showed that rps1 is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA.

6090395|a|To determine the stringent response, a repression of gene activity during amino acid starvation assumed to be mediated by the effector necleotide guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), of metabolically regulated constitutive genes, we measured the transcription of ribosomal protein genes, the constitutive lac operon, and stable RNA genes in a variety of growth media and after amino acid starvation in a relA+/relA pair of Escherichia coli B/r strains. For rRNA and tRNA (stable RNA) it has previously been shown that the distinction between stringent control and growth rate control is unfounded, as the function describing the stable RNA gene activities at different concentrations of guanosine tetraphosphate is independent of growth conditions (exponential growth or amino acid starvation) and of the relA allele present. Here, the results indicated that the stringent responses of ribosomal protein genes and lac differ from their metabolic control during exponential growth in different media. This can be explained by polarity and RNA polymerase sink effects during amino acid starvation which are irrelevant for stable RNA genes but which are superimposed on mRNA gene activities.

8389977|a|The rate of ribosomal protein gene (rp-gene) transcription in yeast is accurately adjusted to the cellular requirement for ribosomes under various growth conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this co-ordinated transcriptional control have not yet been elucidated. Transcriptional activation of rp-genes is mediated through two different multifunctional transacting factors, ABF1 and RAP1. In this report, we demonstrate that changes in cellular rp-mRNA levels during varying growth conditions are not parallelled by changes in the in vitro binding capacity of ABF1 or RAP1 for their cognate sequences. In addition, the nutritional upshift response of rp-genes observed after addition of glucose to a culture growing on a non-fermentative carbon source turns out not to be the result of increased expression of the ABF1 and RAP1 genes or of elevated DNA-binding activity of these factors. Therefore, growth rate-dependent transcription regulation of rp-genes is most probably not mediated by changes in the efficiency of binding of ABF1 and RAP1 to the upstream activation sites of these genes, but rather through other alterations in the efficiency of transcription activation. Furthermore, we tested the possibility that cAMP may play a role in elevating rp-gene expression during a nutritional shift-up. We found that the nutritional upshift response occurs normally in several mutants defective in cAMP metabolism.

8760940|a|Nutrients are major determinants of ribosomal protein (rp-) gene transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this nutritional control, yeast mutants that display defects in the glucose up-shift response of rp-gene transcription were isolated. Interestingly, although growth of these mutants on glucose-containing medium was severely affected an initial increase in rp-gene transcription by nutritional up-shift was still observed. However, at later time points, rp-mRNA levels decreased strongly. Various other types of severe growth limitation also did not prevent the initial up-shift in transcription. The results suggest that the glucose up-shift response of rp-gene transcription comprises two phases: an initial, transient response independent of the actual growth potential, and a sustained response which is dependent on growth and requires both glucose and adequate nitrogen sources. Previously, it was found that protein kinase A (Pka) mediates the initial up-shift response, without the need for regulation of Pka activity by cAMP. The present data substantiate that, besides the RAS/adenylate cyclase pathway, an alternative pathway through Pka regulates rp-gene transcription. In addition, evidence is presented that the sustained response does not require Pka activity. Based on these results, taken together, a model is proposed in which rp-gene transcription is dynamically regulated by multiple signal transduction pathways.

1555577|a|Accumulation of plastid-encoded chlorophyll apoproteins and chlorophyll synthesis are controlled by light in angiosperms. An in vitro system utilizing isolated and lysed barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) etioplasts revealed the specific accumulation of P700, CP47, CP43 and D2 triggered by de novo synthesis of chlorophyll. Accumulation rates of radiolabelled chlorophyll apoproteins were linear for about 30 min. Pulse/chase translation assays showed that synthesis of chlorophyll does not result in increased chlorophyll apoprotein stability. Instead turnover rates of chlorophyll apoproteins were higher in the presence than in the absence of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll-dependent accumulation of chlorophyll apoproteins must therefore be regulated on the level of translation. Translation of chlorophyll apoproteins was blocked to about 50% by addition of 30-50 microM aurintricarboxylic acid or 20 microM kasugamycin. The kinetics of chlorophyll-dependent translation indicated that the in vitro translation system is capable of translation initiation. The capability of translation initiation was lost in lysed etioplasts after preincubation for at least 5 min without chlorophyll synthesis. The results suggest that initiation is involved in chlorophyll-dependent regulation of translation.

Our results demonstrate that both transcript production and transcript stability are important regulatory elements for psbA gene expression in Synechocystis 6803. The production of psbA transcripts was stimulated by light in a process that operated independently of the photosynthetic electron transport. However, stability of the psbA transcript increased in the dark and was controlled by photosynthetic electron transport. The psbA transcript was remarkably stable in the dark, with a half-life of approximately 7 hours. By contrast, the regulatory pattern for the rbcL-S genes was quite different. The light-stimulated production of rbcL-S transcripts was dependent on an intact photosynthetic electron transport, and rbcL-S transcript stability was higher under illuminated conditions than in darkness.

Once processed, the 32-kDa protein translocates, within the thylakoids, to the topologically distinct stacked granal lamellae. Posttranslational palmitoylation of the processed 32-kDa protein is also shown to occur. This modification takes place in a membrane-protected domain and is mainly confined to the protein assembled in the granal lamellae, where functional photosystem II centers are concentrated.

3558409|a|Etioplasts of 4.5-day-old dark-grown barley synthesize and accumulate most of the membrane and nearly all the soluble polypeptides of mature chloroplasts of light-grown seedlings. Etioplasts do not synthesize a limited set of chloroplast-encoded polypeptides which are major constituents of chloroplast thylakoid membranes: two chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem I (68 and 65 kDa), two chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem II (47 and 43 kDa), and a 32-kDa polypeptide which has now been identified as the psbA gene product. Throughout development in the dark, etioplasts were unable to synthesize the chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem I and II or the psbA gene product despite the presence of significant transcript levels for psbA and psaA-psaB (encode for photosystem I chlorophyll apoproteins). Light was not required for the synthesis of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit with the highest rate of large subunit synthesis occurring in young dark-grown seedlings. Illumination of 4.5-day-old dark-grown barley rapidly induced the synthesis of the chlorophyll apoproteins and the psbA gene product at a time when transcript levels for psbA and psaA-psaB did not increase appreciably. Therefore, during the early stages of light-induced development the synthesis of the chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem I and psbA gene product is regulated at the translational level. With continued chloroplast development in the light, the synthesis of the chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem I and II decline rapidly as does the synthesis of the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The decline in polypeptide synthesis correlated with a decline in rbcL and psaA-psaB transcript levels and a light-dependent decline in plastid rRNA content. In contrast, synthesis of the psbA gene product was maintained throughout light-induced chloroplast development which correlated with the maintenance of psbA transcript levels. However, light is not strictly required for psbA transcript accumulation since psbA transcript levels increased slightly with continued plastid development in dark-grown seedlings.

3339092|a|We have previously observed (Klein, R. R., and J. E. Mullet, 1986, J. Biol. Chem. 261:11138-11145) that translation of two 65-70-kD chlorophyll a-apoproteins of Photosystem I (gene products of psaA and psaB) and a 32-kD quinone-binding protein of Photosystem II (gene product of psbA) was not detected in plastids of dark-grown barley seedlings even though transcripts for these proteins were present. In the present study it was found that nearly all of the psaA-psaB transcripts in plastids of dark-grown plants were associated with membrane-bound polysomes. Membrane-associated polysomes from plastids of dark-grown plants synthesized the 65-70-kD chlorophyll a-apoproteins at low levels when added to a homologous in vitro translation extract capable of translation elongation. However, when etioplast membranes were disrupted with detergent, in vitro synthesis of the 65-70-kD chlorophyll a-apoproteins increased to levels observed with polysomes of plastids from illuminated plants. These results suggest that synthesis of the chlorophyll a-apoproteins of Photosystem I is arrested on membrane-bound polysomes at the level of polypeptide chain elongation. In addition to the selective activation of chlorophyll a-apoprotein translation, illumination also caused an increase in chloroplast polysomes (membrane-associated and stromal) and induced a recruitment of psbA and rbcL transcripts into chloroplast polysomes. These results indicate that in conjunction with the selective activation of chlorophyll a-apoprotein elongation, illumination also caused a general stimulation of chloroplast translation initiation.

8318516|a|Even though light is the source of energy for photosynthesis, it can also be harmful to plants. Light-induced damage is targetted mainly to Photosystem II and leads to inactivation of electron transport and subsequent oxidative damage of the reaction centre, in particular to the D1 protein. Inactivation and protein damage can be induced by two different mechanisms, either from the acceptor side or from donor side of P680. The damaged D1 protein is triggered for degradation and digested by at least one serine-type proteinase that is tightly associated with the Photosystem II complex itself. The damaged Photosystem II complex dissociates from the light-harvesting antenna and migrates from appressed to non-appressed thylakoid regions where a new D1 protein is co-translationally inserted into the partially disassembled Photosystem II complex. D1 protein phosphorylation probably allows for coordinated biodegradation and biosynthesis of the D1 protein. After religation of cofactors and assembly of subunits, the repaired Photosystem II complex can again be found in the appressed membrane regions. Various protective mechanisms and an efficient repair cycle of Photosystem II allow plants to survive light stress.

8668172|a|Translational regulation has been identified as one of the key steps in chloroplast-encoded gene expression. Genetic and biochemical analysis with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has implicated nucleus-encoded factors that interact specifically with the 5' untranslated region of chloroplast mRNAs to mediate light-activated translation. F35 is a nuclear mutation in C. reinhardtii that specifically affects translation of the psbA mRNA (encoding D1, a core polypeptide of photosystem II), causing a photosynthetic deficiency in the mutant strain. The F35 mutant has reduced ribosome association of the psbA mRNA as a result of decreased translation initiation. This reduction in ribosome association correlates with a decrease in the stability of the mRNA. Binding activity of the psbA specific protein complex to the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA is diminished in F35 cells, and two members of this binding complex (RB47 and RB55) are reduced compared with the wild type. These data suggest that alteration of members of the psbA mRNA binding complex in F35 cells results in a reduction in psbA mRNA-protein complex formation, thereby causing a decrease in translation initiation of this mRNA.

7738009|a|In order to analyze the structural requirement(s) for proteolytic cleavage, synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal (COOH-terminal) sequence of the precursor to the D1 protein (pD1) of the photosystem II reaction center, with or without substituted side chain(s) around the cleavage site, were subjected to enzymatic analysis with partially purified processing protease from spinach. The efficiency of action as a competitive inhibitor of the enzymatic cleavage of the COOH-terminal extension, as well as the capacity to serve as a substrate, was used as an indication of effective binding to the protease. Neither a COOH-terminal fragment consisting of the 9 amino acids that are cleaved from pD1 by the protease nor a COOH-terminal fragment of the mature protein consisting of 15 amino acids inhibited the enzymatic processing of pD1. By contrast, a COOH-terminal fragment of pD1 consisting of 24 amino acids, which included the sequences of both the COOH-terminal extension and the COOH-terminal 15 amino acids of the mature protein, was effective both as a competitive inhibitor and as a substrate. This result suggests that the structure formed by linkage between these two parts of the protein moiety is important in the substrate-enzyme interaction. Among substitutions around the cleavage site, the replacement of Leu-343 by Ala (L343A) specifically destroyed the ability of the oligopeptide to serve as either a substrate or an inhibitor, suggesting that the presence of the hydrophobic Leu residue is crucial for the formation of the recognition site. A series of six substitutions at Ala-345 had marked effects on the value of Vmax, without affecting the binding affinity, as represented by Km; the order of substitutions at residue 345 in terms of their effects on Vmax was Ala,Ser,Phe,Cys > Gly > Val > Pro.

8665094|a|The D1 protein (D1) of photosystem II (PSII) reaction center is synthesized as a precursor (pD1) and then processed at its carboxyl terminus to establish the function of water cleavage. The amino acid sequence of the carboxyl terminal extension excised by this process is poorly conserved except for a residue after the cleavage site at position of 345. We have constructed a vector for site-directed mutagenesis of the chloroplast psbA gene encoding D1 of the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The vector enables one to transform the chloroplasts of a psbA deletion mutant (Fud7) and directly select transformants for resistance to spectinomycin. Using this transforming vector, we have substituted Ser345 to Gly, Cys, Val and Phe in order to investigate effects of the amino acid side chain at this position on the processing rate. All of the resulting transformants exhibited the PSII activity as wild type and grew normally under photoautotrophic conditions even under strong light where rapid turnover of D1 protein is expected to occur. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that mature D1 accumulates in these transformants at wild type level. Pulse and chase labeling of chloroplast-encoded proteins using [35S] sulfate revealed that the processing of D1 precursor protein occurs in all four transformants as efficiently as in wild type, at least under the experimental conditions examined. The results suggest that either the amino acid side chain at position of 345 (+1 position) is not crucial to the enzymatic cleavage of pD1 in vivo or the apparent rate of processing in vivo is not limited by the enzymatic cleavage.
